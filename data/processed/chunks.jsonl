An unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry. With a group of biotech insiders. I'm Chris Garabedian and my co-hosts today are Brad Loncar. Yaron Werber and Sam Fazelli. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. So first, this is probably the busiest Friday news day of the year because a lot of people wait to make sure they've disclosed everything before the week starts. So we're not going to be able to cover everything in detail on this, but I'll just highlight a few things that came out. There were a bunch of mega private deals announced, in fact, for which were amounted to over 800 million. Three of those four were a China play of licensing China assets, which we're going to talk about more as a trend. A little later in this session. One of them was the former CEO of Myocardia, Tasos Giannakakos.\n\n00:01:00,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n He started another company called Cardigan, kind of a play on myocardia, doing it again. And Perceptive, not the venture fund I manage. But another one that Doug Giordano and Konstantin Pukulov managed, along with Arch and Sequoia Heritage, launched that with $300 million in a new co. There was also an announcement that Lilly and A16Z collaborated on a new fund, which isn't the first time that pharma has come in to support. A large amount of investment in an independent fund, but definitely a sign of kind of the way pharma is looking at getting better play into the venture world. And then I have to say, Endpoints has this thing called peer review, which talks about appointments, new executive changes, additions. And it was the longest list of uh you know movement in executives that I've ever seen so I encourage people to check that out. And then we also heard about the departure of Patricia. Cavazzoni, who was head of Cedar, that she'll be departing before the new administration takes over.\n\n00:02:04,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n And this is a move that came following Robert Califf's prediction of departures. And kind of his salvo of what we might expect with the new FDA. And then Bruce Booth also really just highlighted, I wanted to call out. That, you know, he and I agree with this. It's not about a lack of science or a lack of money, but there's more. Thank you. Sorry about that. There's more dry powder. Uh, to invest in private investments than we have ever had. But they're not spreading it, as he calls, like peanut butter across many investments, but giving hundreds of millions to single proven management teams, as we saw with these morning announcements. With that, at the top of this hour. Brad, there's been a lot of reports that come out around this time before JPM. Uh, you know, John Norris's HSBC, which was former SVB, SVB still puts out their report. Oppler had a great kind of kickoff with the Stiefel report that he's been doing for many years. So maybe start us off with kind of what do you see going into JPM in 2025 this year?\n\n00:03:10,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n What are some of the things our audience should know about?\n\n00:03:14,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, all those reports were really great. I would highly recommend trying to get your hands on all of them. And it's too bad that Tim couldn't be with us today. His was excellent as well. And the theme was basically just biotech's underperformance. So over the last five years. Biotech is down 5%.\n\n00:03:35,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tech is up almost 200%, and the S&P is up 80%. And just the last two years, the S&P has been up basically 25% each year. The reality of our industry is: if you just invested broadly in biotech over the last two or five years, you left a lot of money on the table as opposed to buying the SPY and just like sleeping at night and never thinking about it. And so the question is: why is that happening?\n\n00:04:05,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Will it ever change? I would point out that I think the five-year number is not like a relevant number because The reality is we were in the COVID bubble.","char_start":0,"char_end":4102,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

And so the question is: why is that happening?\n\n00:04:05,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Will it ever change? I would point out that I think the five-year number is not like a relevant number because The reality is we were in the COVID bubble.\n\n00:04:16,089 [SPEAKER_3]\n I always use that word 'bubble'—I don't think enough people do. Because you know, a lot of people sometimes I hear people say, 'Well, when are IPOs ever going to be the same as they were three or four years ago?' Or, you know, when is the sector going to be as strong? I think it's important to be realistic and look back on that time as an aberration that you know, arguably, hopefully, will have been like a once in a generation thing. And so I would not use that as a baseline for anything.\n\n00:04:46,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n But our underperformance has been significant.\n\n00:04:49,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n One thing Bruce pointed out in a couple of really good tweets is interest rates have been coming down like the Federal Reserve has been lowering them. And people. Thank you.\n\n00:05:01,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n have often hypothesized that rates were one of the big things that have held our industry back because our timelines are so long. But as rates have come down, you know, you've seen that tech outperformance and it really hasn't, we really haven't benefited from that at all.\n\n00:05:19,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Obviously, going into JPM, everybody.\n\n00:05:23,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n is going to be talking ad nauseum about the changes in Washington.\n\n00:05:28,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, whether RFK is going to get confirmed.\n\n00:05:31,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n What that means, and you know, all of those changes.\n\n00:05:35,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then, on the venture side, like John Norris's report, I think, you know, Chris, you're really the expert in this, but I think some of the key takeaways from that were that A lot of VC firms raised mega rounds last year, despite the public markets being so difficult.\n\n00:05:54,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n And in terms of deploying the capital, one thing that John pointed out was that There were a lot of really large series A's.\n\n00:06:06,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n and so that seemed to have been, um, a trend, and then the other issue that you know was covered by both of those things and you mentioned it earlier, Chris, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but we talk about this every week. How China is impacting our industry. Tim Oppler had an incredible set of slides on this and the chart that was really like— or the statistic that was really the wow statistic is, last year, big pharma in licensing new molecules, one third of them came from China. Compared to zero five years ago. And so, You know, we've talked about this a lot, you know, China biotech. Literally was not a thing— a handful of years ago. And now it's in the news every single day.\n\n00:07:02,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n And from a venture standpoint, Chris mentioned a lot of those deals, like the The Verdiva bio, the obesity news from the UK yesterday— that's a really classic example of what's going on. So, you know, raise a few hundred million dollars in licensed and obesity, like oral GLP analogs and are creating a company out of it.\n\n00:07:28,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would also point out that, like. And I believe a related statistic is. We've also seen layoffs from US companies over the last week.\n\n00:07:39,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't think those two things are unrelated. I think that smaller, that discovery work and smaller biotech companies are in big trouble if this trend continues. It will have a real impact on jobs and money.\n\n00:07:57,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Over the last year, the number of upfronts that went to China companies was six billion, and you know, again, going back to five years ago, when that was zero, that six billion or maybe even more would have gone to XBI companies and therefore the XBI's performance would have been better than it would. And so I think this is going to be an issue that is talked about a lot more. I've noticed when people, including myself, tweet about it lately.","char_start":3804,"char_end":7913,"start_time":"00:04:05","end_time":null}

I've noticed when people, including myself, tweet about it lately.\n\n00:08:24,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n The engagement on those tweets is off the charts, so it's clear that this is an issue that uh A lot of people are. Starting to feel and starting to think about, my personal opinion is that uh something is going to happen in Washington. In fact, there was a a letter today from Congress people saying that the U. S. biotech sector shouldn't do clinical trials at military hospitals in China. I think you're going to see a lot more headlines like that over the course of time. My opinion is that we're going to eventually be where the semiconductor sector is, and it's going to be really hard to partner with China companies, like we're seeing in the news every day. But we'll have to see what happens.\n\n00:09:10,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, it seems there's a confluence of factors driving this. One is, you know, going back to circa 2017, when the China investment levels for developing products was, you know, really starting. Beginners over the next three to four years before the market dynamics changed in China and turned into a, 'hey, we have all these products, multiple targets that you can go after.' And the confluence of the market downturn in the U. S. where it's all about, 'do we have good management teams to license in these good assets?' because the quality work was done and that continues. And I think there is a little bit of that scarcity value where people want to move quickly on these assets. Um, uh, rather than try to do de novo you know drug discovery or you know products that are in the US but uh, maybe Sam, you know, if you want to extend that, I know we were going to talk about a little bit later, but on the China deals, any perspectives on that and you follow the XBI closely, any other comments on the market dynamics that you're seeing going into JPM.\n\n00:10:09,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, Chris, thank you very much. And I apologize for my voice, folks. I've got quite croaky. Look, Brad and I, I think you're going to be looking, not locking horns, but, you know, being on different sides of this. I'm a citizen of the world, not the United States. Of course, I'm a new citizen. The UK, but I I miss I I believe in science and at the end of the day, if the science is good, somewhere where you can go and access assets, go there. Why not now? If politicians get in the way of folks doing deals in China, then that is how it's going to be. But China started investing heavily in its basic science.\n\n00:10:46,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n They lead massively on particularly areas that are outside of our area, which is material science. And that's where I think you'll find an engineer, you'll find that they are the biggest, they have the biggest share of top 1% papers that are published. You just look back on nature over the past Nature magazine.\n\n00:11:08,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Last few months have had quite a good expose or a series of articles analyzing the uh the trends in in publication and funding. If we want to get this sorted, we need to look home and get rid of this anti-science um attitude. So let's put that away. We did see just around, you know, we haven't had this call for about two or three weeks now. We did see a couple of deals.\n\n00:11:33,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Both on DLL3. So ADC deals for DLR3, one of them was Roche. With um innovative thinking, the other one obviously was idea with hangry. Both about the same sort of size— 80 million dollars up front and then some milestones. And so this, I counted about 10 DLL3 assets on the go now. So obviously Amgen was one of the first. AbbVie tried years ago and it didn't work out.\n\n00:12:00,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n With their acquisition of stem centrics, but you got a four adcs, four um, as to my count, at least a very quick count, um, the uh tc, uh t cell engages, and a couple of and one one, um, uh radio ligand therapy from novartis and another one which is a car t from legend, so that's a busy space, and yet people are going out there and licensing these assets. So. What happens in the DLL3 world in the future, I don't know, but it's certainly happening. And some of it, the latest ones came from China. I think quite a few of the others may have too.","char_start":7613,"char_end":12077,"start_time":"00:08:24","end_time":null}

I think quite a few of the others may have too.\n\n00:12:38,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n Now, back onto XBI. I don't know. I mean, look, we talk about rates, rates today, or at least the prospects of no more or less rate cuts is impacting the entire market. So it's not just biotech that's selling off today— we've also got the tech sector that's selling off. The 250 that is $56, 000 jobs report, uh, that we saw just came out today and that exceeded forecasts, and a whole bunch of people are saying, 'Look, this really does support the case for a a halt in rate cuts.' There are some folks who are even talking about including our own interest rate analysts— 2026 being a year where, um, rates might go up again. And we can't ignore that. It's not about rates or not rates. It's about cost of money and where you can get easier and cheaper returns. And rates are at 5%, 6%. That's a very easy way to just park your money and not put it into risky assets. So that's what we're going to have to, I think, deal with going forward as well.\n\n00:13:41,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I think the XPI is going to do that.\n\n00:13:43,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and I wonder, Brad, you can comment on this. So the interest rates have not come down the way everybody was hoping they would. And is the issue happening where the investors are looking at, as they start to move money into higher risk sectors, they're viewing tech as less risky or a better risk reward. Then, biotech, maybe it's the— you know, large language models, the AI, machine learning, the quantum, where they feel that that's going to be translated more easily, or maybe it's a better narrative for investors to understand. Versus on biotech innovation. And investing in that is perceived as higher risk to tech, I mean, is that part of this dynamic where we're seeing money flow into tech from a downtick in interest rates versus biotech. Any thoughts on if there's more discernment between these sectors?\n\n00:14:35,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I said this in Tim's report, and I believe it strongly.\n\n00:14:42,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, we're so focused on our own jobs that I think sometimes we're missing the important big picture and the big picture, in my opinion, is that our industry is going through true structural change.\n\n00:14:59,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Like the entire every politician and the entire general public would prefer that the size of our industry be smaller than it is today and that the prices that our industry charges be lower than it is today.\n\n00:15:14,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's a real headwind. And you're starting to see actual movement on that for the first time ever. So, of course, we had the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n00:15:24,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Unprecedented— the first time ever that price setting from at least from the government standpoint has entered the picture. You know, if you look at the rock and roll years of the XBI, it was like 2010 to 2015.\n\n00:15:40,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think, if we're being honest with ourselves, those were the peak years of, you know, company, you know, drug company on January 1st. You always see that list of, like, drug prices that have been increased. Back then.\n\n00:15:54,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Some companies would raise prices like 15, 20% of big drugs every year. So it was just out of control. And also, I think in terms of the IPO market. Back then, there was a lot of story stocks and it was a lot easier to IPO. So I'm a very strong believer. I know this sounds really negative. I'm a very strong believer in the future. Of our industry, but um, in terms of our society trying to keep a lid on us, that's a really big headwind. And then we have all this uncertainty with what's going on in Washington. I mean, certain things about our industry could be totally rewritten. And as we're talking about this China issue, again, it's a totally new factor.\n\n00:16:48,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, that didn't exist five years ago, that we have this world competitor that's apparently doing things faster and cheaper than we're able to do on a discovery side.\n\n00:17:04,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think it's underappreciated.","char_start":11777,"char_end":16128,"start_time":"00:12:38","end_time":null}

And speaking of the tech sector, I do think that some people want to see the same thing happen to the tech sector. You hear a lot about like breaking up big tech and everything. And so I think, if those types of things ever start to happen there, if that gets real movement, then I do think sentiment can swing back to biotech. Um, because that, you know, that would be they would be going through the same thing that we're going through now. Um, but uh, I.\n\n00:17:40,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n And until then, I think that we're living in a different world today than we were 10 years ago. And so I'm not surprised to see the challenging environment.\n\n00:17:52,149 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I was just going to add one other headwind: on this is the lack of M&A. I think even going into JPM, where we expect to see some deals of significance. And I think that that is usually a bolster of people getting a little bit more sanguine and excited about valuations in biotech. So that's been another one. Despite the FTC overhang kind of going away a little bit with a change in administration. But yes, Sam, pleased to add to it.\n\n00:18:20,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n Just—just—just— just. A little plug here. We have a Bloomberg intelligence, we have a fantastic podcast from our tech team called Tech Disruptors, and just the one at the beginning of the year, we have a what's going to happen in 2025. Bye. a conversation with john chambers who's the ex cisco ceo he's the guy who took the company of course and a big team of people behind him from a 70 million dollar business to 45 billion dollar business so we should listen when he speaks but it's a personal view of his right if you listen to that podcast only about 30-35 minutes long called tech disruptors he talks about what he thinks is going to happen in the next year and then 10 years with regards to ai tech machine learning, et cetera, deepfake, et cetera.\n\n00:19:08,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think it's very easy to dismiss tech in terms of thinking. that there is a young or possibilities of breakups or pressures on the tech sector in general because of the same reasons, i . e. more expensive money. But we're only at the very beginnings of the impact of AI on anything, even including drug discovery. So. I think we should be cognizant of that fact. We should think about the possibility that there's lots of money to be made in that sector and probably potentially quicker. and not turn a blind eye, but be cognizant of it so that we don't. Forget that our sector competes for money with others.\n\n00:19:50,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I think we need to be too insular in how we look at our work. We need to understand the broader context of tech and the the broader macroeconomic issues. I agree with Brad that we're going through some structural changes. I also think that the patent cliff issue has been talked about, and that they're going to need to fill that. So, you know, that's an issue to watch. And of course, the themes of cardiometabolic and CNS, and some of these new therapeutic areas that are getting a lot of attention. Uh, and there is a lot of dry powder, as Bruce Booth pointed out. We've got more money to invest in private at biotech, so exciting stuff.\n\n00:20:29,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n But let's transition to— Chris, maybe, I know we have a big agenda, but I think I'll be remiss if I don't just plug in a couple of things here. Yeah, please. One of the things we do every year is we look at the beginning of the year, how the sector trades through J. P. Morgan and then through the Cowen Conference, the first two big conferences of the year, as a predictor of what's going to happen with the rest of the year. And usually, believe it or not, history, not so shockingly, does repeat itself. It feels like this year has been a total tough year already.","char_start":15828,"char_end":19999,"start_time":"00:16:48","end_time":null}

And usually, believe it or not, history, not so shockingly, does repeat itself. It feels like this year has been a total tough year already.\n\n00:20:59,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n Both the XBI and the IBB, thankfully, are only down 1%. So they're actually pretty much in line with the S&P, the SPY and the QQQ. That's very important to see what's going to happen next week. If we still finish down next week, history suggests we're going to be down for the year. If we're going to be managing to get back up next week, we're going to be hopefully in a better place. So that's pretty important. Look, I do want to say one other thing with Brad. I hear you a lot, but we've all done this for a long period of time, and we've all been singing how the fundamentals of this industry are going to go down. And in bare years, it feels that way.\n\n00:21:42,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n To me, the fact that China is actually innovative is not the end of the world, as long as we can license those drugs, launch new codes. Bring that IP and then own the global commercial market. The US companies or potentially European companies will be the commercial enterprises because this is where you generate the vast majority of returns. The way biosecure will end up going down, and it's not over, those companies, the Chinese companies won't win out. They're not going to come here. So I can live with the fact that we can license their IP. I hear you about pricing.\n\n00:22:20,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Typically, when access is questioned, the sector is under stress, and it's exactly what we're going through now. But I think the IRA has handled that. I agree what we've been through. These were the bull, frothy years, but that's not normal. I do think the fundamentals of the sector will come back. We just need to deal with the next year or two on interest rates.\n\n00:22:41,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yaron, on that point, you know, we're heading into JPM. This is usually a little bit of a signal of how the market responds to the news, to all the activities. And like you said, how's the market going to react? So let's talk a little bit about, you can kick off. And Brad and Sam can weigh in. What's ahead this next week at JPM? And, you know, what can we expect? What can our audience expect to happen over the next week?\n\n00:23:05,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, I'll do a quick kind of. or high-yield survey. So here's what, sadly, I don't think we're expecting at this point. We're not expecting a lot of deals. We're not expecting mega deals. And the IPOs have all been— you know, getting pushed out. What we're also seeing is we're back at those markets that sadly many of us have swam through many times. Where if you have data, the stock goes down, and it doesn't matter if the data is positive or negative. These days, it's a question of how much the stock is going to sell off, or if you have a catalyst. So I think it's going to be a little bit of a muted JPM. Argentix, we think will pre-announce and beat. Uh, Waveguard's doing very well, and they'll give an update this time on their early pipeline. I'm starting with Argentix because that's one of the bellwethers. So I think that one continues to look good. Amgen doesn't really do a lot around the conference. And this year, frankly, what we're hearing is that their biosimilar iLEA is going to do well. So that's going to be probably a tailwind for them. But the big question is MERITIDE, and we're not going to have a real update now until mid-year at AD.\n\n00:24:10,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n And even that is not going to be in a position to really clarify some of the concerns. So Engin's probably going to be a little bit under pressure in general. People are obviously looking at BioNTech for the VEGF PD1 updates and Summit. Those are probably going to be from phase two later on this year. And those are going to be driving tempo on both of those. We might start getting some of the phase three out of summit in the second line EGFR mutated setting late this year. We'll need to see. Um. I think CT . gov talks about data in 2026, but it depends on survival, obviously, in that study.","char_start":19699,"char_end":23948,"start_time":"00:20:59","end_time":null}

We don't think they'll get acquired. We think Cabo is going to be sort of in line and their guidance is going to be in line. And then it's going to be up to the early pipeline to sort of perform. So obviously, like I said, a huge year. Last year, we're probably not expecting the same strength, absence of M &A. This year. Ascendus is a big one. Delt pre-announced under growth hormone, the weekly growth hormone, Skytropha. Remember last year, year was a tough year for that brand because the competition from Novo and a lot of pricing pressures. Now that Novo launched, and frankly, even Pfizer. We think Sky Trofa is going to be mostly in line, given that they guided down already in Q4. And, you know, 2025 is probably going to be sort of over. Okay in terms of where they guide. The big one, obviously, is going to be their launch of Your View Path. That's their once-daily version of the PTH replacement.\n\n00:25:51,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n We think that launch is going to go well, but they literally just launched in the middle of December.\n\n00:25:57,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Another big one that people are looking at is Ultragenyx. And as many of you know, they're developing a drug called citrusumab, which is a rank ligand antibody, not dissimilar from Amgen's Evanedi. Evanedi is approved for osteoporosis. It's the only bone-building drug. And recall, if you have osteogenesis imperfecta, you have a congenital, you know, essentially genetic disorder where your bone doesn't make your body. and make bone properly. And based on the phase two data with Ultragenyx, they did a very nice job building bone and reducing fractures. And now we're all waiting for that phase three data. Ultragenyx is our top pick.\n\n00:26:42,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n What we're all trying to figure out is: would the study work on the first interim analysis, which is expected to take place imminently, probably in January? Or is it going to be on the second interim analysis, which we think much more likely to be powered correctly to then stop at that point? And that's going to be around May or June. And if that doesn't hit, that's going to be the most likely one to hit. Then they have to go to the final one, which is around October or so over this year. But all the, you know, Ultragenics will probably pre-announce after the close today on Crucivita. Which is their other, uh, called X-link hyperphosphatase drug. Um, But that's not so important. Everybody cares about citrusumab. We think they're just going to say that they're continuing to be bullish and it's probably going to stop in the second look. So that's kind of a survey of some of the the important companies that we cover.\n\n00:27:34,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great. I know you usually plan some uh interviews, video interviews for Biotech TV with the newsmakers of the week. I don't know if you've announced that yet, but what what are you looking for and looking forward to over this next week, or any highlights for who you're going to be talking to?\n\n00:27:49,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I have 16 interviews scheduled, and we'll put out the roster a little later today. And actually, now that I'm on the journalism side, I actually know stuff. So I'm gonna I'm going to pass on this one. I don't want to comment on anything.\n\n00:28:06,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great. Well, let's go, Sam, if there's any other thoughts you have for the week ahead. Otherwise, we can start on some of the news flow that's been happening over the last couple of weeks since we met— last in Biotech Hangout. So, Sam, if you have any other comments on what you're looking for for the next week, otherwise we'll start with kind of Pfizer's urine comments and the Part D issue to kick off the news. No, nothing for next week.\n\n00:28:31,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm happy to kick off onto Pfizer.\n\n00:28:36,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so look, again, it's been a few weeks that we've had this. So one of the things that Pfizer did, which was quite nice, was to actually talk about IRA.","char_start":23648,"char_end":28008,"start_time":"00:24:49","end_time":null}

So one of the things that Pfizer did, which was quite nice, was to actually talk about IRA.\n\n00:28:46,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n talked about. This is the year that large pharma is going to get it squarely in the face with regards to the impact on the Part D redesign. And they actually took the initiative to tell us how much is going to hit them. So they worked it out at about a billion dollar net. 500 million boost, 1. 5 billion drag. So that's a 1. 6% hit to the top line. So that's from the Part D redesign.\n\n00:29:10,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Now all the other pharma companies are going to get hit too. But our expectation is actually not that they'll— but that most of them will not tell us how much. We've checked that with a couple of companies and they've told us we don't think we're going to go to the same granularity as Pfizer did. So that's quite interesting. And that's—we're going to have to figure it out. I'm pretty sure they can absorb it. But I'm interested to hear from the others whether they think. This particular year, and that impact is going to be affecting their, I don't know, their M&A appetite, certainly not licensing, because that's easier to do than. than meaningful M&A or is it actually going to change it for the positive? That'd be interesting or not at all. I'd be keen to hear the thoughts here. And one last thing I wanted to say on that term.\n\n00:29:57,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n IRA type impact for the year is our Washington analyst thinks that actually the next list may be announced before.\n\n00:30:07,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, um, President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office on January 20th, so that could be an interesting list. 15 drugs to come, we think Ozempic from Novartis will be on it. Channel from Merck, which of course not many people care about that much, and some of the um, cancer drugs extending from Pfizer, Astellas, and then Merck. So it's going to be interesting whether they do rush that out, well, rush that out, bring it out a bit earlier, just ahead of the year. Slurring of the president. So this year is another IRA story.\n\n00:30:42,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Sam, let me ask you about that. You know since we're transitioning from one administration to the other. Do we know how much of that process can be influenced, either positively or negatively, by political appointees? I haven't really thought about that.\n\n00:31:03,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n You mean the new incoming folks such as RFKs, etc.?\n\n00:31:09,469 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right. Like, you know, everything in government is, you know, civil servants kind of do the work and then you have political appointees at the top of it. And I'm just wondering, like, how much of the whole IRA.\n\n00:31:22,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because the you know, the major headline let— because there is a process of selecting the drugs—right? Brad, I mean, like, there is a choice that's made that needs to be brokered. So would the new administration might have different views on it versus the old?\n\n00:31:34,640 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I think the biggest headline exactly, but I and also I think the biggest headline from the IRA last year was that the government didn't go as deep as it could have. That was like. a choice that somebody made and so I guess the question is: Now that we have a new administration, can the leadership of of the new administration for this round either choose to go deeper with cuts or not as much, like how much?\n\n00:32:06,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n Who's making that choice and is there any reason to expect variability from one administration to the other?\n\n00:32:14,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'd love to hear what Jeroen thinks of this. I think, from our perspective, it's very easy for President-elect Donald Trump to just roll with it. It would be the it would just be optically odd to go against something that supposedly is good for, uh, the provision of healthcare in the US in terms of that particular aspect. Um, and I think by the time a lot of these folks are actually sworn in, etc., or torn in, take charge, a lot of this would have happened already. And what we are interested in is whether they can fix the other side of it, which is the small molecule.","char_start":27708,"char_end":32060,"start_time":"00:28:31","end_time":null}

And what we are interested in is whether they can fix the other side of it, which is the small molecule.\n\n00:32:56,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n Exemption period from 7 to 11. There is a bill. The bipartisan bill. We don't see a very high percentage of a chance of it being passed in this, but the next session could be. That is the sort of thing I think that they could focus on saying, 'Look. We leave the negotiation side alone. Let that happen.' But we're going to actually equalize the world as regards to small molecules and biologics. That's where I think they are sitting.\n\n00:33:23,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n It'll be an important thing to watch for sure.\n\n00:33:26,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, if we see any kind of change.\n\n00:33:29,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n One thing that I'm sure you've all noticed is the, I don't want to call it mass, but it's beginning to feel like this is not a good cadence of exits out of the FDA.\n\n00:33:39,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n At the senior positions.\n\n00:33:42,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n So that's something that we're following very, very closely because, you know, at the end of the day, there's the political appointees, even Bob Temple is retiring.\n\n00:33:51,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, You know, the FDA commissioner and the head of CDER are leaving. and we think this is going to be, this is the beginning, so these are things that actually are very important, as we all know.\n\n00:34:03,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and I mean, look, Patrizia was right, was kind of supported by Janet Woodcock, who was kind of the steady leadership for a long time, along with Bob Temple and others, but um, you know, again and I think I think the jury's going to be out, right? I mean, I. If we were to be honest, I don't think that anybody would agree that there's not some inefficiency, some inconsistencies, uncertainty that has always been present between hierarchy, policy positions, and the divisions. There's always been this battle between division and hierarchy in terms of their policy and platform presentations, and what the FDA is trying to achieve versus what the divisions are willing to do. The lifetime civil servants that are really making the decisions.\n\n00:34:48,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, there could be some positive aspects that come out of this for drug development on the industry. So it'll be interesting to watch for sure. Let's move on. Some other news. So, Jeroen, do you want to highlight Stoke had an announcement this week, Jasper, as well? Maybe you can highlight those.\n\n00:35:08,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that the one commonality on both of them has been the markets that we're in right now. So Stoke announced their phase three plans for their drug called Sorvunersen, which is an ASO for Dravet disorder. Of a patient with an SCN1N mutation. They've updated their data in December. This is their phase two, showing a tremendous 70%, 80% reduction in seizures and neurocognitive benefits. So now they've presented what the phase three is going to look like. Which, to many people, there were some concerns. Can they even move into phase three after a phase one, two, and let's say 70 or 80 patients? They got a breakthrough designation right before that. And so it looked like the- Phase three trial design was in line or better than expected. They were able to move into phase three. The primary endpoint is actually going to be seizure reduction at six months. So everything looked good, and then the stock goes down fairly precipitously, presumably because they said, 'Well, they're going to start to study mid-year.'\n\n00:36:16,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n Know it takes four to six months to start a study, so I think that should not have been new, but they're not going to have data until probably the end of 27. So you know any company that, then, presumably will need to raise money gets penalized.","char_start":31760,"char_end":35774,"start_time":"00:32:56","end_time":null}

So you know any company that, then, presumably will need to raise money gets penalized.\n\n00:36:29,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n Then you had Jasper releasing their Phase One and Phase Two data with their CKIT antibody. They're sort of a fast follower onto CELDEX, their drug called Bequia. Solimab, Celtics is Barzolamab in Phase Three already. And the beacon data, this was a small study, still multiple arms looking at dosing. And we all knew we're going to get the early doses, so there's still going to be higher doses. Efficacy already looks good in line. The bottom line there is that they're not differentiated. Which, frankly, we didn't think they're going to be. They're trading at a seventh of the market cap of the competitor. Um, so the data, because it's not differentiated, and because there are cap, they need to raise money, and they're about 18 months behind or so. Well, that stock is down 60%, even though the data, I would say, would look in line. And they had the same sort of class side effects as well. So I think we're just in a tough market right now where, you know, companies are probably gonna think twice. Do they really need to raise?\n\n00:37:30,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Do they need to really release data if they have, unless they, you know, obviously legally obligated to do so, they might as well wait.\n\n00:37:41,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And it's interesting. And I don't know my experience, you know, going back when I was a public company CEO is that, you know, the stock movements are always more pronounced, whether it be on the upside or the downside. When JP Morgan News is released, and uh, and then they'll stabilize at some point, but it'll be interesting to see, uh, how you know, just stocks respond if there are news events through the week, uh, at JPM, sometimes companies announce before they present formally at the conference, um, Sam, uh, a couple, uh, news items from Novo, uh, you want to cover those, yeah sure.\n\n00:38:13,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n So obviously, the big news from Novo came just before Christmas, which was, Okay.\n\n00:38:19,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think right on the, the hour before I put the turkey in the oven. And that was Cagriceva. So that's come out and everybody knows the story. But then it followed a whole bunch of other downgrades, etc. People were beginning to worry: is Lilly competitive? Is it going to be able to, sorry, is Novo going to stay competitive, etc.\n\n00:38:41,459 [SPEAKER_1]\n And this year is going to be quite interesting because we're going to see that data. I still have a little bit of a hope. Very small amount because I think what nobody's been saying along the way is that it's— they're going to try and look to see whether they can push the dosing up on Kagrisema. But I was always wondering whether the whole point of something like this, of that combination of semaglutide and an amylin agonist. is to be able to maybe get a better excuse. Me.\n\n00:39:11,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Weight loss. Um, and not have the same sort of side effect profile, which of course was something that didn't quite work out at the same time. Ameline is supposed to be something that allows you to not lose as much muscle.\n\n00:39:26,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n But fat now muscles got a high, heavier excuse me, weight and then fat. So if you is, it possible that when we see the data, there's actually as much fat loss but not as much muscle loss in these patients who were taking Chakrasema. I don't know— we'll see. I don't even know whether we get that sort of data when it comes to it at Ada. But there's a whole host of other stuff that's going to come out this year that continues to be competitive against Novo, if you like, which is Lily's GLP-1 pill or for Griplon. Um, maybe Pfizer's. Hill we'll see that both both of them are supposed to come out um at some point in the new year. Possibly one cue and then of course you've got the other element that's quite interesting and we're going to be keeping watching which is the what happens with all those anti-myostatic drugs that people have been developing things to try and help maintain that muscle mass. So scholar rocks data regenerance data. And of course, Eli Lilly's own Pimagromab sometime this year.","char_start":35474,"char_end":39885,"start_time":"00:36:16","end_time":null}

And of course, Eli Lilly's own Pimagromab sometime this year.\n\n00:40:29,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n So all of these things, I think, continues to highlight the risk for. Um, news flow risk for number notice. I think the drugs are going to continue to sell, obviously, because it's it's a market that wants to own these things and. And I've been having some emails from friends telling me after Christmas, Sam, do you think we should go on to Zeb Barons or we go V? Because I'll put on too much weight post-Christmas. And I think that attitude will continue.\n\n00:40:59,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, just a fascinating market sector to watch, especially with the competition heating up. I'm sure, Sam, did you mention the VeloHealth?\n\n00:41:08,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, so, I mean, that's a deal that Nuva had. Before and they've just expanded it beyond further.\n\n00:41:15,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n And it's quite interesting because I just wonder whether NOVA is using this as their AI platform, essentially. Now, Velo did have a bit of bad news just before Christmas, so this was quite helpful to see. And that was a product that didn't work out.\n\n00:41:33,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n My feeling is that this is a good way for NOVA to have access to any AI capabilities, if that's the way you want to think about it in the cardiometabolic space.\n\n00:41:46,859 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, off their balance sheet, so um they'd be interested to see how this pans out and whether they get anything meaningful out of it over the next i mean it's a pretty expensive deal— you know, 10, 18, I think, assets. Potentially and then Of course the numbers get multiplied up, this is it. Milestone we can get for each and therefore several billion dollars potential.\n\n00:42:08,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yep.\n\n00:42:10,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, one of the bigger news items this past week was Galapagos, which we've talked about a lot on this forum in that. You know, they, Despite bringing in Paul Stoffel's well-known executive, it was part of the founding of the company, they still really couldn't buy any valuation above their cash position. And so it culminated in a uh split uh into two publicly traded companies, or the um it's what was announced uh and uh Sam, do you want to describe that? And Brad, I'd love to hear your thoughts on. You know, a little bit of a throwing in the towel and I think with a creative structure that is interesting—might even be the best thing for Gilead to salvage something out of that. partnership. But Sam, you want to describe this, this deal, and then would love to hear your and Brad and your own comments.\n\n00:42:58,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'd love to hear everyone's comments on it. So basically, the company is splitting it into two, one remains Galapagos. With about 500 million dollars in the bank and all the CAR-T work that they've been amassing, the manufacturing and the assets they've got for Lymphoma.\n\n00:43:17,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n And the other one is Spinko, with about 2. 5 billion euros. And that will have its own new management. And its job is to go and find assets to develop, which I thought was Galapagos in the first place.\n\n00:43:30,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n Gilead holds 25% of each.\n\n00:43:33,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n It seems to me that this is to get them out of the what they call the 'olka' which is the option license and collaboration agreement which was a 10-year deal they did with Gilead. Um and It suggests to me that previously, because of the structure of that deal and the opt-in that Gilead had, it became very difficult for them to do anything. In anything beyond phase one, which is where the option writes from Gilead.\n\n00:44:04,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n I am I'm assuming that's the case because in the meantime, as this company with this enormous amount of cash, as we're looking for deals. Things like um Revolution Medicine have occurred. Remember, that was a reverse into a highly cash positive company with nothing to do. After the event.\n\n00:44:26,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n Verbio, which we'll talk about, Verbio did a deal from with Sanofi that has helped them gain a half a billion dollar market cap in the past few days. You've had all these deals, new codes with Chinese companies. So why did none of this happen within the structure of Galapagos? Maybe that was the issue.","char_start":39585,"char_end":44070,"start_time":"00:40:29","end_time":null}

Maybe that was the issue.\n\n00:44:51,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'd love to hear what the others think, and we can talk about the CAR-T and the potential for Galapagos in general, if we've got time or we're interested.\n\n00:44:59,910 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, one of the amazing things about Galapagos over the last year or so, after the Gilead stuff kind of blew up, is it's always had this enormous multi-billion dollar cash balance and it's had the largest negative enterprise value in like all of biotech. So it was only a matter of time, I think, before uh you know investors started to apply some pressure. You saw, for example, I think Echo R1 took out a pretty big stake in them and you know probably had some influence in this process and everything. And I really like Paul Stoffels. I've interviewed him in person at JPM last year and have the highest respect for everything that he's accomplished in our industry. I mean, he's truly one of the most successful people in drug development. Out there, I think that investors hated the CAR T acquisition.\n\n00:46:04,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it's actually a really interesting story.\n\n00:46:08,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, because it's so different, the idea there is rather than having central manufacturing like we have— you know, like the kites of the world have— like a couple big manufacturing centers across the country and in Europe and everything. The idea is to do kind of personalized manufacturing at hospitals and in cities. And so eventually, it's going to require like a a huge, literally national and global scale out. If this comes to fruition one day, it's a totally different way of thinking about doing CAR T. But I think because it's totally different, and also, you know, CAR T is just kind of out of favor right now in terms of startups.\n\n00:46:53,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that investors were not wild that that was like the first major acquisition of that company and that it's been the focus operationally of it since then. And so I'm not surprised to see a CAR T version of this story going one way and a cash version going the other way.\n\n00:47:14,939 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Chris, if I may add, I mean, look: Getting manufacturing away from central manufacturing to more disseminated manufacturing for parties is obviously what we need to do. We can't keep forever waiting to have stuff sent over to a central manufacturer and then brought back. One of the things that it achieves, if the theory works out, is that you get essentially fresh cells. Fresh cells are better than frozen cells. I think we just have to assume that, just like in any other part of the world. You also have a manufacturer that's really fast, seven day, vein to vein. I think that speed is probably going to be matched by pretty much most people in the next year or two. But putting all that together, and then some ASH data that they presented, particularly mental cell lymphoma. looked viable. I'm not going to be sitting here saying it's the best car tea company out there. But what's interesting. is Gilead has its own Qarti. are Celex and 25% of this one. right so they're in a particularly nice place as far as their consent.\n\n00:48:17,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm pretty sure that they'll be able to cherry pick or combine these technologies or efforts or systems together at some point if any of them show off and show show good data sets. If that manufacturer works as perfect, plug it in. So.\n\n00:48:34,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n We'll see.\n\n00:48:36,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I still don't understand why the company needed to split to achieve this. I mean, why couldn't they just renegotiate the deal with Gilead to unshackle the cash balance, essentially?\n\n00:48:50,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n To go and get a whole bunch of other assets.","char_start":43770,"char_end":47790,"start_time":"00:44:51","end_time":null}

Uh structure changes that don't have a real big impact, but sometimes there's always the hope that it will uh to be able to attract different investor bases. Uh, you know, this happened when I was back at Celgene, and there was a lot of feeling that they should just stick with Hemonk and not get into INI, and some investors liked the diversity, some didn't, and uh. You know, that was a big debate back then. So I think this is always the case when you have a big pile of money and you're trying to figure out how to how to use it. You might attract different investors. Your own. Did you ever cover it? Galapagos, any comments on this?\n\n00:49:42,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n My colleague, Phil, covers Galapagos, and we are involved as an advisor as a bank. So I would politely decline to comment.\n\n00:49:52,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep, sounds good.\n\n00:49:54,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, you mentioned Veer, but is there anything more you wanted to add in terms of the, you know, vis-a-vis the GenX? on psa or you want to uh Just elaborate a little bit more on that.\n\n00:50:04,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, no, I think that's fine. I think we can move on to the next topic. Okay.\n\n00:50:09,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, yeah, sure. What else do you have on your list?\n\n00:50:11,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n So the next thing was the verbiotic data, which was quite interesting. I'm watching.\n\n00:50:18,509 [SPEAKER_1]\n Janix's share price, which is down about just over 30% from the peak that it was at after the excitement for the data that they present, which was very good in prostate cancer. So Vervieta came out with their version of a masked T-cell engager. So the idea is that it's similar to Janix, but slightly different.\n\n00:50:38,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n That you have a T-cell engager, i. e. a BI-specific antibody or fragments or whatever that bind CD3 at one end and a target antigen relative relevant to your tumour at the other end. So what Giannex did was to cover essentially one end of it, and that is the CD3, the T-cell binding site. And what these guys have been doing, they've been testing, which is an asset that they acquired, a technology they acquired from Sanofi. Is blocking both ends. The CD3 binding. and the antigen binding such that, when that antibody or that entity goes into the tumor, then the proteolytic activation allows the unmasking and then activation. So.\n\n00:51:25,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n The data is early. Um, I think the best I would put is that it seems. It's definitely from a safety profile, it's competitive, it's better. Uh, lower CRS etc. efficacy.\n\n00:51:39,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n It doesn't look as good, but it's early days.\n\n00:51:42,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's still dose escalation going on. When you put the charts next to what Janik showed back in February last year, it looks about similar.\n\n00:51:52,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, But these are very difficult comparisons to make on such small numbers. And I think it's, I find it odd that the share price of GenX gets hammered so hard.","char_start":47490,"char_end":51080,"start_time":"00:48:36","end_time":null}

And I think it's, I find it odd that the share price of GenX gets hammered so hard.\n\n00:52:03,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I don't find it odd that Verbiotech's share price goes up because it was trading at close to cash. And here they will have some positive data which might get better all the time. One of the things I want to highlight, and maybe I'm pretty sure Jeroen will have a thought on this too. Or in general. is that The dosing is significantly higher. They're going with at the top end of the dose range was one milligram per kilogram. So on an average 80 kilogram patient, this is 70 or 80 milligrams per patient. Whereas Jannik's was at 6, 8, 12, right? 12 is the top end that they tested. And the idea is that CD3 engagers are exquisitely active because all you need is a little bit of a tickle of that T cell to get things rolling. So I was sitting back scratching my head thinking, 'Why is it such a high number?' And one reason could be that don't forget that the antigen binding is also. So how is this antibody going to distribute within to the tumor versus anywhere else if it doesn't have specific binding until it gets into the tumor, to the target?\n\n00:53:09,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's the thing that I wonder whether that's why they need. Milligram per kilogram, or 80, possibly going up to two milligrams per kilogram, to push to get the equilibrium right so that they get enough antibody in there. And when you get to that higher end, are you going to have the same safety? Lots of questions, but nice to see another progress here on mask disease.\n\n00:53:30,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, but by the way, Sam, that was a great summary. It's possible that GenX is down because it's in the basket of potential takeouts. And I think you're beginning to see a lot of them have been trading off in the last few weeks, potentially.\n\n00:53:43,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n Due to unwinding of expectations into JPM, but that might explain some of it.\n\n00:53:51,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n Right.\n\n00:53:52,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well.\n\n00:53:53,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, you want to highlight briefly any other news items? Do we have any more time?\n\n00:53:57,630 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, we do a little bit of time. I think I might just talk about an unfortunate patient who died in Louisiana, having been highlighted by the CDC from bird flu, H5N1, back in mid-December, late December, and folks generally ignored it. And then the individual unfortunately passed away with comorbidities, etc. And what is more relevant perhaps is, and the share price reaction of the companies that then followed, CureVac, Novavax, Moderna, Biotic, they were all up on the back of this. And of course, the news that there's a big flu issue going on and I'm sitting here with the respiratory. The back end of a respiratory infection, of course. Um, and those share prices got all excited. The problem is.\n\n00:54:47,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n In that individual. or not a problem, thankfully, in that individual, the frequency of H5N1 virus that had any kind of mutation that would allow it to transmit from human to human was very, very low. And there's been no evidence of human to human transmission.\n\n00:55:05,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Once that happens, God forbid, that is when I think that's the time that comes to think about these companies as a possible pandemic. stockpile help. But there's already a pandemic stockpile out there from Sanofi, CSL, and GSK, the first one having been approved back in 2007.\n\n00:55:24,409 [SPEAKER_1]\n So those share prices went all the way up and the next has been all the way down. And um, We're here sitting, fingers crossed that we never see human-to-human transmission from this H5N1 virus.\n\n00:55:36,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n Thank you.","char_start":50780,"char_end":54701,"start_time":"00:51:52","end_time":null}

And I just want to highlight the news that I mentioned at the top of the hour, that the Lilly. a16z deal it just brings in to the question around Lily's cash position, and you could argue Novo. as well and how they might be doing some things differently in the industry. and how they use that. But really, there's been a lot of pharma companies doing external innovation and trying to find early-stage investments. This is a bigger play to work with an outside venture firm, and Pfizer had a collaboration with Flagship. It's not the first of its kind, but probably the biggest and most notable. Uh, and how— You know, Lilly and maybe other pharma companies might follow that type of model to work with a firm that's just focused on finding the best investment opportunities. So I know Bruce Booth couldn't be on this. He highlighted this as an interesting development. So maybe it's a topic for a future biotech hangout. But just look, we know everybody's busy, maybe traveling, maybe waiting for news flow and events.\n\n00:56:38,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Brad, we all look forward to your plans for the week and who you're going to to interview.\n\n00:56:44,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's been an honor to be part of Biotech TV with BioVenture Voices. We've interviewed Alexis Borisi, and that'll drop on Monday for people to have extra free time over this next week to hear his perspective as a serial entrepreneur, investor in biotech. But a lot of exciting stuff we expect over the next week. Hope you've enjoyed these insights. Any final comments, Brad, Yaron, Sam, for the audience?\n\n00:57:11,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I would just point out in case people haven't seen our tweets and LinkedIn posts, every Tuesday of JPM, it's an annual tradition.\n\n00:57:21,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n We have what we used to call the tweet, and now we call the hangout. It's an open social event that's open to everybody and anybody. We have a lot of generous sponsors who are supporting it. So, all the drinks are free, and we'll have some food and everything. It's the Tuesday of JPM at Persona, which is just like a block away from Union Square. It's easy to walk over. I would love to see everybody there. There's an RSVP.\n\n00:57:52,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n You can just kind of show up, but there's an RSVP link. Well, Brad, I have a formal statement I was provided. Let me just read that for everybody. Biotech Hangout will once again be hosting our in-person networking event at JPM on Tuesday, January 14th, from 7 to 10 p. m. at persona, which is the same location as the past two years. We hope to see everyone there for a fun night and open bar. Importantly, thanks to our sponsors: Johnson & Johnson, MS Pro FT Consulting, Pure Tech Health, and Catalytic Agency. Be sure to RSVP, and they will share a registration link in the feed again, in case you missed it. So I won't be there, but Brad, you'll see— Brad, Daphne, and many other of the hosts of Biotech Hangout. We'll look for you to tune in on the post-JPM Biotech Hangout next week.","char_start":54401,"char_end":57758,"start_time":"00:55:24","end_time":null}

I'm Daphne Zohar, and my co-hosts today are John Merriganori, Mikey, Sam Fazelli, and special guest John Crowley, the CEO of Bio. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, despite some deals highlighted by J &J's $14. 6 billion purchase of Intracellular. Market sentiment was muted, with poor performance from some companies like Moderna, Lilly, Sanofi, and also smaller companies like Viking. as well as other small biotechs that were down 20 to 30% on no news. We're going to dig into the deals soon, but Mike, what are your thoughts on the week and overall sentiment?\n\n00:00:56,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, first, thanks for having me on. It's great to be on again and after quite a busy week. Um, my thoughts coming away from the long week, number one, as you were saying, i am not sick. i feel great.\n\n00:01:13,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n The weather in san francisco was phenomenal, so that was echoed. by everybody. So that was just a really great, refreshing change to the conference. More importantly, I guess I would say that I felt sentiment amongst. Uh, the client base there and companies, in my opinion, was uh about a five out of ten. I look forward to everyone else's opinions. I'd call it a five out of ten. You know, Daphne, stocks were hit pretty hard going into December and into January. And then I believe Monday and Tuesday was pretty rough again. And Wednesday had a little rebound. But despite the M&A that you just mentioned, it was pretty rough. And so you have that side of the equation that it feels like, here we go again. So that was a bit challenging.\n\n00:02:10,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n On one side. The other side is also— I think people looking forward. I think there is a bit of a debate about the optimists who would say things are already bad.\n\n00:02:23,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n A lot has already been priced in on the negative side with RFK. And also, valuations are actually pretty cheap these days. So I think there was a good discussion and healthy discussion amongst a lot of investors and clients about where we go from here. Like I said, it feels like a five out of 10. I do feel. We're a bit on the upswing, but I'm certainly not calling it a raging bull market. But I feel like people were pretty optimistic about the health of the year given. The overall broader markets are doing well. People feel that the administration is probably not going to come down too hard on the industry and the RFK. May dial back some of the rhetoric. I think there was a Wall Street Journal article commenting about at least two people in the administration who are maybe getting pushed out because of too much negative rhetoric. And that hopefully the administration will be a little bit more common sense as we go forward. I felt it was a pretty good start to the year, Daphne, despite the stocks going down.\n\n00:03:25,530 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I am fairly optimistic about the rest of the year.\n\n00:03:31,070 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, I want to come back to you on the IPO window because I've been hearing it's pretty tough and that we're It's going to be a while until we see a bunch of IPOs price and do well in the post-market. And until then, it's going to be rough going. Any thoughts on that? And then I'd love to actually hear from John Maragonori. about Metzera and just generally what's happening in the private investment community.\n\n00:03:57,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n So when Yeah, let me comment about the start of the year without you know going into too much detail obviously Jeffries and what we're working on here uh is a huge pipeline of things that are expected to come through. And I would say that there was a bit of a foot off the gas pedal in December and the plans for January. You saw two private biotech get taken out on Sunday. Um, uh, not sure how much is publicly disclosed, but of course it would be reasonable to think that those two companies were trying to go public and, therefore, given the state of the conditions, um, it took uh, a nice uh number up front to get acquired instead. So I think that's pretty interesting and, in fact, there's a number of private companies. We have a whole list. That were getting acquired over the last six months. As a reflection of the fact that the capital market is a little tough.","char_start":0,"char_end":4458,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I think we're watching this. I think people do expect that we will get back going here. And I do know that, I guess, Metzera and some of these others have drawn comment. But we will get back on track here, and I expect some deals to start getting underway.\n\n00:05:21,190 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe Daphne to follow up on the Metzera question, but, you know, maybe first more broadly, I mean, I just came back from. from that meeting and and look it i agree with Michael in the rating of a 5 out of 10 is probably right you know i think people enter the meeting with a lot of uncertainty around the policy environment. And, you know, we're gonna hear from John later, which is super great. And look, I mean, I think, you know, actually, you know, we bookended the week. With, you know, first news about Cavazzoni resigning and then some positive news about Crowley being invited to be part of this, you know, discussion group around FDA. the future. So, you know, to some extent on the FDA side, we'll wait for John to talk. But, you know, maybe we should be, you know, we should pause before we pass. And maybe there's reason for optimism. And, you know, the markets, of course, are still jittery around interest rates. And so that's factoring into things. There are green shoots.\n\n00:06:22,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, Medcera is filed. They flipped to go public. And, you know, they presented some data last week that, you know, Mesa. This concept of a once-monthly GLIP. And that story, of course, was very dynamic during the meeting as well.\n\n00:06:41,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm reasonably optimistic that we'll see high-quality, good stories get out. We did have some good IPOs last year. Bycara is one that I've been involved with that I'm really super excited about. But it's been a tough capital market environment, and it will almost certainly remain discriminatory until we get better visibility on interest rates at the end of the day. But I'm excited about where Metzera is going to go because that's. That could be the first one that goes out this year.\n\n00:07:13,780 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, and it's important that the first ones that go out do well. One question I had— I actually bumped into Josh Schimmer and Tim Oppler and Brad and a bunch of others at our biotech hangout party. And we were talking about XBI and how XBI has underperformed now for three years in a row. It's down about 3% so far this year. One thing that Josh said, which I thought was pretty interesting, is that the XBI is not a good limit. litmus test for biotechs and he was saying that the average biotech was up last year. I think he actually mentioned you, Mike, and saying he got that data from you. Do you know what he's referring to?\n\n00:07:53,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, so I will say that we and our client base continue to look for a great indicator that well reflects the biotech sector. There are not great, um, and say, baskets or index funds, XBI is created. Uh, to, for, many years, I created as a equal, um, equal dollar value, uh, and so, uh, everything is weighted to, uh, for example, one and then therefore that takes away.\n\n00:08:31,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n Market cap weights. And so, uh, what was also interesting is that every, I believe, 90 days, the whole index all got rebalanced again to 1. 0 for every stock. So you have a constant every 90-day rotation of about 130 stocks that were getting rebalanced irrespective of size. Uh, uh, What happened recently was that they then shifted, I think, actually, just a few months ago. shifted to much more of a market cap and liquidity weight. It's a bit of a complex equation. And show, um. Here again, not a perfect indicator, but uh, leans now more towards larger caps rather than, say, maybe you know, the 200 smid caps that we might focus on and discuss here again. I think it's 130, if you want the exact number of stocks.","char_start":4160,"char_end":8464,"start_time":"00:04:54","end_time":null}

I think it's 130, if you want the exact number of stocks.\n\n00:09:21,199 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I agree with Joshua. I guess he was referring to my data. That does suggest, again, it's not a perfect indicator. Here was an interesting one, though, Daphne, because I think the XBI was ended, what, plus 1% or something like that. So it was right on the border. um but uh. It was definitely a a bunch of baskets of haves and have-nots. There were great numbers of winners, Daphne, but also a ton of losers. And so when you weighed it all out, it came into about 1%. But we're still looking for a good one. And I guess XBI is still what we have.\n\n00:09:54,860 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, thank you for that. Sam, any thoughts on general vibe for the week?\n\n00:10:00,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, so I've been obviously watching it, definitely from a distance, not on the ground with you guys. But we do have a very active um client chat that's um in it at one point. Somebody said, 'Why don't we, why don't they just stop the conference because it's killing a whole bunch of stocks I think that was on late Tuesday afternoon or early Wednesday. And I think a lot of that is just on the back of the downgrades and the guidance. That folks came out with, obviously right out the door, was Moderna and then Lilly, which didn't help and it dragged a whole bunch of stocks down. But in terms of sentiment, I'm going to have to defer to you guys because I wasn't there to take the temperature.\n\n00:10:43,510 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, sometimes I think those that are watching remotely get, they have more time to actually read up on all the news and follow what's been happening. But I felt like generally the vibe was: Yeah, I would say I agree with Mike's five out of 10. On the one hand, the Monday started off with. some deals, which we will talk about in a moment. And I think people were excited about the science, the fundamentals. But you could. probably juxtapose that onto the last few years and The question is, how does that translate into general sentiment, stock performance, etc.? I felt like that part of it was a little bit more negative. But. Let's. Go to the main just before sorry.\n\n00:11:30,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n Just before you go ahead, given that you we spoke about the material, how do we feel about the first IPO test being an obesity name with a GLP-1, given what we've heard at the conference, Pfizer say, a variety of companies talk about, and then of course, the The questions with regards to all the other Bobi City companies that are around. How do we feel about that? Is that a good? Is that a good start?\n\n00:11:57,010 [SPEAKER_5]\n Well, I would love to hear from Mike and John. I think that the obesity space has definitely kind of the bloom has come off the rose a little bit in terms of the competition, the level of competition. But I still think there's going to be some big opportunities. John, you know this company specifically? So do you want to comment on that? Then go to Mike.\n\n00:12:22,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think we might have lost John.\n\n00:12:25,010 [SPEAKER_5]\n No, I think he's dead. Yeah.\n\n00:12:27,930 [SPEAKER_5]\n Mike, do you want to go first?\n\n00:12:29,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah.\n\n00:12:29,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, so I want to make two comments. First, I do believe that. The challenges that you're seeing with the performance of the group, starting on Monday, is absolutely in part due to the Ah. higher for longer interest rate environment, and the macro. And I use the term that the macro has the steering wheel. And I think that. A lot of the volume and a lot of all of this stuff trading week to week and month to month is just all of the same biotech funds, specialists and hedge funds. and very much less to do with all of the bigger money that we wish was involved in the group. And so what happens is on Monday and Tuesday, yeah, you had some deals. But there was no follow through. And uh, you'll actually see we might get to some of this magical sold off hard Vikings been selling off hard. And a number of companies that were quote unquote supposed to be takeouts. All traded significantly down because, oh, I guess they're not getting taken out.","char_start":8164,"char_end":12565,"start_time":"00:09:21","end_time":null}

All traded significantly down because, oh, I guess they're not getting taken out.\n\n00:13:30,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n And there's no support. So I do believe that the industry environment— the lack of generalist support—has continued to be much more focused on tech. Uh, certainly, in the large cap space, magnificent seven, and a whole bunch of other groups that are benefiting from the rising tide of the market in the Trump administration, and much less focused on biotech. So I do think that's an important dynamic. The second thing, as it relates to Met, and the general appetite for obesity as an IPO. I would say that the.\n\n00:14:03,150 [SPEAKER_4]\n Did you say bloom coming off the rose? That is, I think, right. I think you have obviously just had. Now two straight quarters of Lilly. disappointing and so down 20, 25%. You're going to take a foot off the gas on that group. Amgen down, a whole bunch of stocks all down on that, but nobody.\n\n00:14:23,619 [SPEAKER_4]\n doesn't believe that this is going to be a huge and massive market. So, if a small company with the GLP-1. uh or whatever version of GLP-1 you have in some cases, there's guys with weekly some people a bunch of injectables uh that they have a successful drug that moves forward to phase two and phase three. then that will create value. It's just all going to come down to, are they going to be $1 billion market cap, $600 million market cap? What is the valuation to start?\n\n00:14:50,839 [SPEAKER_4]\n because that will be the most sensitive part, certainly the first year or two.\n\n00:14:57,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I could just jump in and I missed the first part of this.\n\n00:15:03,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think that there's no doubt that this is going to be a massive market over time. And, you know, the quarters and the ups and downs, I mean, even NVIDIA has got ups and downs in quarters. And we just have to be conscious of the long game here. The penetration of these drugs is still a fraction of where it can go. And so I think there's no doubt that this will be— a very big and dynamic market for many years to come. And companies will have to differentiate with what they bring forward and they'll get rewarded if they do so. And that's the bottom line. Why Metzera is going to be an exciting story in the first part of the year. But there'll be others too. And even the entrenched leaders like Novo and Lilly will have enormous success in this category.\n\n00:15:48,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n And John, just to cap this, Dave Ricks, I can't remember in which conversation— on their presentation, or on Bloomberg TV, or with the stat team—he put it very succinctly. Somebody asked him about Cagri Sema, and he said, 'Look, anyone who tries these incretins, you're not going to get magic. But you're definitely not going to get disappointed.' Now, I'm paraphrasing here. I don't know exactly the words that he used, but frankly, it's just going to be a game of 'I want a piece of the market share.'\n\n00:16:18,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, yeah.\n\n00:16:19,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, cool.\n\n00:16:20,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think I couldn't agree with Dave more, and I think it's a question of how does one plays in this sector right now, in this growing space. But it's really just the beginning innings of this story, at the end of the day, which is what makes it exciting.\n\n00:16:38,200 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, and it's such a big area that affects so many people. Somebody was commenting that a lot of their colleagues have looked like they've lost weight and have mentioned that they're on some of these new obesity meds.\n\n00:16:52,620 [SPEAKER_5]\n It's a big area.

So first of all, I'd like to say congratulations to the team and CEO Sharon Mates. And I'll mention here that if you guys were out and about, you would have seen a lot of people wearing pink. And that was the biotech CEO sisterhood out in force. So, there's about, I think, there was about 500 people at a group. uh, picture but it's a big change from few years ago when I think there was more men named John or something like that presenting at JP Morgan than women. I don't know if you remember that.\n\n00:17:40,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I remember because I'm named John. I do remember that. But Daphne, are you still wearing your pink?\n\n00:17:46,230 [SPEAKER_5]\n I'm not, but I did wear it. And I wasn't wearing as bright a pink as everybody else, but I was there in the crowd. And this is a great group— this biotech CEO sisterhood, which was organized by a couple of colleagues, which maybe we'll mention them afterwards. Go ahead, John. Though, what were you going to say?\n\n00:18:03,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I, I, I wasn't going to say anything other than just asking you— asking if you are still wearing your pink. But I think, if you, if you guys plan on doing it every year, which I hope you do, that's good news, because then we can all, you know, we, we supporters can all go out and buy some pink attire to uh, to join on that event.\n\n00:18:23,110 [SPEAKER_5]\n I think every Tuesday, JP Morgan from now on is going to be pink. So that's a little bit less boring to look out on Union Square. I think we might have John Crowley. Join. Through Hang out with you, John.\n\n00:18:37,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n It is, Daphne. Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm a little late with technical issues logging in, but great to be here. Thank you.\n\n00:18:44,430 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, welcome. We were just about to go to intracellular, but before we do, any thoughts? How did you spend the week at J. P. Morgan and any thoughts on general sentiment?\n\n00:18:53,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I, for the first time in a couple of decades, actually did not go to JP Morgan. So I was out, I had a couple of speaking commitments around the country and, uh, one in New York, one in Florida, and then sometime in Washington.\n\n00:19:07,870 [SPEAKER_5]\n Okay. Well, we're going to come back to you because we're very eager to hear from you about your thoughts on the administration and all the concerns around China. So we'll come back to that in a moment. So as I mentioned, J &J announced that they're going to buy Intracellular for $14. 6 billion.\n\n00:19:26,750 [SPEAKER_5]\n Intracellular's lead asset, Capylita, is approved in the U. S. to treat schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The company also recently asked the FDA to expand colitis clearance to include major depressive disorder. Which affects about 10 times as many people as schizophrenia. And they had some really good data recently. This would be the largest acquisition of a biotech company since the Karuna BMS deal and the fourth multi-billion-dollar acquisition of a CNS drug developer in the last year or so.\n\n00:19:57,899 [SPEAKER_5]\n 2024 was a bit of a roller coaster for companies in the neuroscience space.\n\n00:20:02,810 [SPEAKER_5]\n With the M&A side, Coventry approval and interest by pharma companies being very positive, juxtaposed with some setbacks with regard to data for a number of companies in this area. Pause and open it up to the group to comment.\n\n00:20:17,889 [SPEAKER_2]\n Definitely. Just let me ask, you're obviously CEO of a neuropsych or neuro company, if you want to call it neuropsych. I think it's neuropsych. How do you feel about the challenges and opportunities in the space in general, having obviously had a hand in Corona and then now?\n\n00:20:36,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n A new company and, and having seen this deal, how do you feel about how this is going to shape up? Some folks have told me that they think the next decade will be the neuroscience decade.","char_start":15820,"char_end":20178,"start_time":"00:16:52","end_time":null}

Some folks have told me that they think the next decade will be the neuroscience decade.\n\n00:20:46,060 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, so we talked about obesity and, you know, similar to obesity and hypertension, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychiatric disorders affect a major part of the population. There are hundreds of millions of people across the world affected by just depression and anxiety. So, and if you look back, you can see that these have been among the most commercially successful and widely prescribed drugs of all time. So, pretty much every drug approved for depression has been a commercial success.\n\n00:21:20,400 [SPEAKER_5]\n With some reaching mega-blockbuster status. And at the same time, clinical studies in this space are very difficult. They're challenging. You have to have experience with the issues that come up. So for example, patient selection must make sure that you have patients that actually have depression and that you're not enrolling patients with inflated ratings or what are called professional patients. Dose selection is a huge issue. So if you're intervening with patients too much, you're going to get higher placebo response, as we've heard. A number of studies reporting issues with compliance. So I think that it's an area that's very challenging for clinical development. Something like 93% failure goes from preclinical to clinical proof of concept.\n\n00:22:11,929 [SPEAKER_5]\n I won't comment specifically on my company, but I will say that one of the areas that I'm very encouraged by is that there's been a number of drugs that have been advanced. And could make a major difference for patients. But have some issue that we can now solve with today's technology.\n\n00:22:30,320 [SPEAKER_5]\n Xenomalin was a perfect example that, with the advancement of CARX-T, and I think there's many other examples like that and that will be helpful because you're starting with clinical data.\n\n00:22:41,669 [SPEAKER_5]\n So, someone, as a side note, someone was joking that clinical development in neuropsychiatry is tough, but when you have a success in late stage clinical development, it's worth about $14 billion. So that's a joke.\n\n00:22:54,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n So 40 . 6.\n\n00:22:55,830 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, 14 . 6.\n\n00:22:58,510 [SPEAKER_5]\n Right. So any other comments on this deal before?\n\n00:23:01,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I have a couple of comments. One is, you know, I think Bruce Booth, as he often does, is such a great historian for the industry. But he did a very nice tweet this week congratulating Sharon, of course, which is terrific. Also commenting on the value creation story. And I found it striking that they raised a grand total of $1. 2 billion.\n\n00:23:28,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n Private and public at the end of the day, which is an incredibly capital-efficient. I mean, they've been around since 2002. They were originally funded by Moshe Alafi, of all people, you know, going back to those of you that are old enough to remember who he is. But it's just an amazing story. At the end of the day. So, you know, congrats to Sharon Mates and as a founder, CEO. as well. I think that's also particularly special in these circumstances. Just one other comment, which I was really happy to see the guys at Jeffries participate in this deal as well. It wasn't, you know, Centerview was involved, of course, as well, but it wasn't just them. There were others involved too, which is always a good sign. For how the field and the M &A banking lineup is evolving. Over time.\n\n00:24:23,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I guess I get to comment on that.\n\n00:24:25,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n You do.\n\n00:24:26,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n All right. Yeah, I guess that brought Jeffries into the conversation. Now, first, more holistically, Daphne, look. It's great to see a large transaction get done, you know, the headline was, you know, the biggest transaction above 5 billion.\n\n00:24:43,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now, since I guess—correct me if I'm wrong— would that have been probably Karuna Saraville, right?","char_start":19878,"char_end":24088,"start_time":"00:20:36","end_time":null}

Uh, but uh, it's it shows you that a big pharma is engaged in this space, highly interested, uh, those molecules, I guess, cerebell to a lesser degree. The two of the those transactions were de-risked, uh, and um, speaks to the commercial opportunity. Speaks to pharma, uh, engaged, and and doing deals. So it's not like, where are the deals? There you go, uh, and um. And yes, I did also get a lot of public press there in Financial Times about Jeffries. Involvement there, which had in part to do with Phil Ross, who had come from JP Morgan. So that was quite an entertaining article in the FT. Yep.\n\n00:25:40,200 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah. Congratulations. By the way, somebody was pointing out that Eric Tocat from Centerview has stopped tweeting all his deals. I don't know what happened there, but that was always fun. We look for his tweets in the morning of JP Morgan saying that there were some good deals happening.\n\n00:25:56,569 [SPEAKER_5]\n So let's move to other. There was a couple of other M &A deals. And as you pointed out, Mike, that they were private companies, which is probably viewed as a bit of a bummer for the public investors and and there's been sort of a big number of biotechs that were private that have been acquired over the last few months. And you had mentioned a couple of these companies were set to IPOs. Let's talk a little bit about GSK and IDRX and then Lilly's Scorpion. Do you want to kick it off, Mike, and then Sam?\n\n00:26:27,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, yeah, so I just wanted to say again, starting high level first, is that it speaks two right off the bat on Sunday.\n\n00:26:36,050 [SPEAKER_4]\n That two private companies that, for all intents and purposes, without getting too specific. Were slated to go public. And what happened? Right. So that is. If the capital markets were great, they were going to be heavily subscribed and it was going to be a huge IPO performance. Then, typically and maybe John could speak to it, you know, they pass on the M and a perspective because you're going to get a great valuation and go up. Can raise, can raise more money. So that speaks to what I said is that the IPO market is a little bit challenged. And therefore they look to the exit of M &A. And pharma has been all over this. And so maybe it's a comment about how Pharma believes that a lot of the other public. Companies have either been picked over or, as I like to say, 'Everybody knows the M&A targets and they're all overvalued.' And so pharma has a tough time going after those. Because everyone's picking and looking at the same ones. And so they ended up going smaller, tuck in.\n\n00:27:38,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n Uh, lesser or say it less risky. I'd say. Um, smaller tuck-ins and therefore can pick those up on the private side, where they don't have a public valuation. Um, so uh. That speaks to the conditions of the market. Um, and I I'd also say, cause I know there's on our agenda to talk about a whole lot of other licensing deals. So that's also been a big. A topic is that Gilead specifically is not only just did one deal, but they've done a couple now. On the small side. Uh, Abby J. and J. and a bunch of others also doing that too in the inflamed space. So the three themes I saw coming out of the last week in the last couple weeks were: one, private companies get acquired. To a whole lot of licensing deals getting done instead. And three, is a whole lot of China-formed companies. So whether that's China, NuCo, and then coming over to the U. S., or China assets that are being found or licensed and then brought over to pharma.\n\n00:28:39,950 [SPEAKER_4]\n Whether as a new company standalone or getting done through pharma. I think that's really interesting, and that is definitely a big trend that's happened in the last, say, three to six months.","char_start":23788,"char_end":27979,"start_time":"00:24:43","end_time":null}

Yeah, let me pick up on that. We'll go to China and then we'll come back to the other deals that happened this week. So, and I'm really interested in hearing from John Crowley here. So China has been a major topic of discussion. I would even say concern. Pharma is now sourcing nearly a third of external molecules from China. Over the last year, $6 billion of licensing upfronts went to China companies. This competition didn't seem to exist in the same way before. And I think the sentiment is that in prior years, the money would have gone to XBI companies. And the concerns for U. S. biotech were highlighted when Merck bought an oral GLP-1 in December from Hanso for $112 million up front. And that caused Structure Therapeutics and Vikings, who had both had multi-billion dollar market caps, their shares to fall sharply. We've seen this trend in other areas like oncology, where China-sourced compounds are now going beyond Me Too to meet better.\n\n00:29:51,790 [SPEAKER_5]\n And it was actually interesting to see InnoVent in the news this week with the Roche deal, $ 80 million up front and a billion biobucks for an ADC, from China's InnoVent. You will recall China was very much out of favor after Lilly returned rights for a PD-1 inhibitor to InnoVent in 2022. After it was rejected by FDA due to FDA criticism of China only data, this had blowback on EQRX, who was pursuing a strategy of cheap drugs from China at the time, basically crashing that company. I was really interested to see that Alexis Borsey, who founded EQRX, and I think IDRX, by the way, is now at Curie Bio. And he's now warning companies not to publish any data on new mechanism drugs and be very ambiguous in patent filings to protect from really fast follower Chinese competitors.\n\n00:30:40,620 [SPEAKER_5]\n Who can move faster at a lower cost? You know, their clinical trial enrollment apparently is speedier. Supply chain staffing costs are lower. I want to go to John Crowley. I would like to get your thoughts on what policy initiatives are in play that could protect US biotechs? I know the Biosecure Act is still potentially on the table for March, but that's not necessarily going to address this concern. So we'd love to hear your thoughts on China in general and any policy-related initiatives that you guys are pursuing or that you're aware of.\n\n00:31:12,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure, Daphne. I'm happy to comment. I think maybe, to begin, we can just start with, you know, there is, of course. A broad geopolitical amount of tension and competitiveness between the United States and China. And we play into that. So our industry isn't unique. In this regard. And I can tell you, in my now nearly a year in Washington, including my day one, working on the biosecure challenges and opportunities.\n\n00:31:37,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n I have not in quite some time, if perhaps ever, seen as bipartisan.\n\n00:31:43,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n focus on a particular strategic issue. And you know, the guiding principles are for us and our industry that. Biotechnology is incredibly important. It is a national security asset. And you need to care. And when I say you, that's from the general public to policymakers, lawmakers. And these are the points I kind of continue to hammer home in all of our conversations on anything touching our industry: that you need to care about biotechnology for the public health, of course. You need to care as a matter of national security and as an instrument of national security. And you need to care for the economics and the economic growth aspects of a broad, strong bioeconomy. I think another broad principle that we've tried to emphasize is this: it is not xenophobia. This is not unfounded fear. There is a strong strategic competition. China has stated, now for many years, that they intend to become the world's center of excellence in biotechnology.\n\n00:32:44,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n The United States, together with our allies, continues to lead in biotech. China plays a really important role in this ecosystem.","char_start":27679,"char_end":32067,"start_time":"00:28:39","end_time":null}

China plays a really important role in this ecosystem.\n\n00:32:51,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n But we have to maintain and advance our lead. Um, the last kind of guiding principle that I used in, in both private and public discussions on these issues, is to just state, again, that, again, we believe, the world is a better, safer, healthier, and more prosperous place when we continue to lead. So then you get to one of the policies. Now you've got biosecure, and you saw where we've come from. That. I think with the position that we took back in March, again, it gave us a voice in the conversation. And it gave us credibility on the issue. And with that, we were able to shape it so that for another key principle— no harm, no harm to patients, no harm to the biomedical research establishment. And I think as you saw the final versions of BioSecure come out, we all agreed, if it does become law, it's something we can live with. With respect to biosecure, I would expect again to see pretty strong, overwhelming bipartisan support. In the House, the Senate is much more of a challenge as we've seen before.\n\n00:33:54,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Senator Rand Paul, in particular, and a few others, have been opposed to it for a variety of political and, in Senator Paul's case, as libertarian principles. So I think while we might see it come up again, I think likely here in the next few months in the House. It seems with respect to the biosecure law that the Senate will still be a roadblock. The only likelihood of it actually becoming law, I would think, is if it gets tacked on to, probably, a year-end defense appropriation. It fell off the last NDAA back a couple of months ago. So whether biosecure becomes law or not, likely in its current form or anything near to it. Would have a pretty limited effect on our industry and for the things you guys you know we were just talking about, kind of the emerging biotech advantages in China. You highlighted one, Daphne, in particular, the pace at which they can begin, they can enroll, and they can complete their clinical studies. It's really remarkable. And it's a major strategic advantage for them.\n\n00:34:56,949 [SPEAKER_1]\n And something we need to think about is— we think about our whole ecosystem and changes.\n\n00:35:02,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n From a legislative standpoint, just briefly, we will see tariffs. Uh, we've. We believe that, you know, President Trump will issue many, perhaps up to 100 or more executive orders day one. When he comes into office on Monday. There is the potential that he could issue an order declaring a national economic emergency.\n\n00:35:22,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n If he does that by executive order, he then has the authority to invoke what's known as the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And that could give him pretty broad authority to enact new tariffs. So what that would be and the impact on our industry broadly. We'll have to see. We're prepared for a whole variety of outcomes.\n\n00:35:41,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n There is another, and the last I'll comment here, with respect to policy, that could be important here: are rules and restrictions on outbound investments to China, including in the biotechnology field. That has been a challenge for Congress.\n\n00:35:57,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n There was a member of Congress, Chairman McHenry, from North Carolina. He just recently retired from Congress. He was adamantly opposed to any legislation blocking outbound investment.\n\n00:36:11,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n On the other hand, Speaker Johnson. This has been one of his key priorities, in fact, limits on outbound investment, including to China. We're part of the December continuing resolution discussions. That fell off like a number of other key parts. We expect that it'll come back. We think they'll garner support in the House. Again, there will be stumbling blocks in the Senate to this. Unclear is what Secretary Bassett, with his experience as a successful hedge fund manager, what his point of view would be on this. I've not seen public comments for him on this.","char_start":31767,"char_end":36048,"start_time":"00:32:44","end_time":null}

I've not seen public comments for him on this.\n\n00:36:47,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n But ultimately, I think the bottom line is, you know, it's relatively limited in terms of what we can do from a policy standpoint in the early days to limit the growth of biotechnology in China. I think the better way to look at this is, what can we do to strengthen our ecosystem? And there we've got some really. Big bold ideas and we're getting great traction, so I'll pause there. Definitely.\n\n00:37:10,970 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, let's pick up on that. What we can do, for example, to address speed of clinical development and FDA reform. It sounds like you're going to be more involved with the administration and be able to provide some input. What are your thoughts in general with regard to FDA reform that might be a positive for our industry?\n\n00:37:37,640 [SPEAKER_5]\n I'm being optimistic. Love to hear your thoughts.\n\n00:37:40,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm optimistic as well. I won't or can't right now comment on any role I may play. Play advising the administration or any discussions I've had leading into a new Trump administration. But look, our basic principle since the election day has been that bio is a cross-partisan organization. And our job is to advocate and develop policies that advance biotechnology to find common ground. I spend a lot of time with Democrats and I spend a lot of time with Republicans— as does our team. And you know, my view here is one of constructive engagement. While there may be some people, some nominees, and others where we have concerns— from a policy standpoint, sometimes very serious concerns— there are ways in which we can vet those privately, and if need be, publicly, if they run counter to our beliefs and our core structures. But I think it's really one of constructive engagement and and the one that you brought up right— the FDA. We've been working for the last year, one of the things I did last year was a series of listening sessions around the country and hearing, where are the challenges for us in biotech and there are many, but also where are the opportunities?\n\n00:38:52,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n And again, what would you like to see addressed? We've now begun, and Daphne, you've been a key part of this, and John as well, with our board and our executive committee. And you'll see one of my key priorities now coming into the new year is a broad template, an initiative we call BioAdvance. with a number of key cornerstones, two of which are. ensuring the resiliency of the supply chain. And again, I think there's a lot we can do to ensure the resiliency of the supply chain. here in the States and among our allies. but another key component and probably the number one thing I heard. for more than 100 emerging company CEOs in these listening sessions. was that we have to reimagine the clinical trial. regulatory paradigm. that we've evolved to a point where it simply costs too much money, takes too much time, it's too uncertain to develop our medicines. So let's really think bold about how we do it. We need a strong and effective FDA that has to continue to be the gold standard around the world.\n\n00:39:53,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n On safety and on efficacy.\n\n00:39:55,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n But let's think about how do we reimagine clinical trials? How do we think about? Condensing enrollment timelines? How do we think about IRBs, university contracting? What's the role of the CRO industry here?\n\n00:40:08,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n And then within the FDA. How do we strengthen leadership? How do we reduce bureaucracy?","char_start":35748,"char_end":39547,"start_time":"00:36:47","end_time":null}

How do we reduce bureaucracy?\n\n00:40:13,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n How do we really elevate regulatory science and take You know, in many ways, our science and our medicine coming out of our companies has leapfrogged the FDA's ability to digest and process and evaluate our technologies. And it's defaulted to a very slow and cumbersome system. So while protecting patient safety, ensuring we understand efficacy. Let's understand, right? How do we use? When is it appropriate? To use biomarkers, accelerated approval, adaptive clinical designs, Bayesian statistics, and let's approach this with the same mindset we did in Warp Speed. years ago in COVID. That we need safe and effective medicines, therapeutics, vaccines. But we need them as quickly as possible and we need them for everyone. So those are kind of the core principles. I'm optimistic that and based on the discussions I have had and some going back eight years to the early days of the Trump administration.\n\n00:41:13,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n showcasing you know for us early on it was our family's personal journey and the world of rare diseases and now it's much more broad. than that. And I am optimistic that this fits in with priorities of advancing science, realizing the importance of biotechnology.\n\n00:41:30,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n overemphasize enough that the part of when we talk about the importance of biotech for national security, again, showing what free democratic societies can do. to promote public health and, again, a more prosperous, secure world. So there will be challenges. We've got to carefully follow how they think about MFN and these tariffs. But I think addressing the FDA, the clinical trial paradigm. Addressing fixes in the IRA, Congress now is going to look at the IRA. I'm confident we're going to have hearings on 9 verses 13. on orphan cures. And between Congress and between the White House, I'm hopeful that we can find solutions that will really advance medicine. Other initiatives that pediatric review voucher is incredibly important for us and for a number of our members and for patients. And I'll just end with you. There's going to be a very large tax bill this year. It's probably going to take some time to pull it together.\n\n00:42:31,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n I do believe that we can address the R&D tax credit. In this construct. but also, too, when we get back to manufacturing and incentives. For manufacturing in the United States. I think that's going to be an important vehicle. So let me pause there, but you know, with well still plenty of challenges in front of us, I'm optimistic that I think we can be in a better place and move the ball forward in a way that will really help our industry.\n\n00:42:57,130 [SPEAKER_5]\n Thank you, John. And thanks for all the work, the important work that Bio is doing. It's great that somebody like yourself, who's a drug developer, who's advocated on the part of patients, including your own children, is. And understands the industry so well is. The one who is leading this organization, let me open it up to others for comments and questions, and we also have a a question from John Connolly, who heads up the Parker Institute Science Group there. He's the CSO there. So I'll open it up. I think Sam and John, Michael first.\n\n00:43:31,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n I just want to make a comment, one, you know, thanking John Crowley again, you know, as you did, Daphne. It's fantastic to have him involved here on this issue. And, you know, John, as you know, I mean, I believe that these types of initiatives, done well, you know, science-driven, focused on the evidence generation in a very solid, important way to maintain our gold standard status, is going to be critical. And I do think that these types of changes can can evolve the US environment for success in the biotech sector, which really allows us to continue to be the leader around the world. In what this industry does. I mean, I believe in more carrots and less sticks as a way of, you know, dealing or addressing concern around our standing in the world as a leadership in biotech. And I personally, I have no doubt that we will continue to be the leaders in biotech, even if other.","char_start":39247,"char_end":43687,"start_time":"00:40:08","end_time":null}

At the end of the day, but if we have an environment in this country that enables our sector to continue to be the most successful in the world, that policy environment will allow us to continue to be in that pole position. And that's what we should strive for with more carrots, as I look at it.\n\n00:45:06,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n John, that's very well said. You and I are a thousand percent aligned on that.\n\n00:45:13,330 [SPEAKER_6]\n So, John, given that alignment. Are you confident that the administration understands that and that the nominations that have been out there may understand that, despite the rhetoric, and that maybe the markets are too jittery, and we will see some visibility and resolution.\n\n00:45:33,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n I am. I think that will become increasingly clear with the number of the policies. I think, if you look in the weeks ahead, to the Trump administration's approach to the entire drug development paradigm, I think you'll see it very aligned with how we see the world. And again, for those reasons of the public health, national security, economic growth, and security. That's resonating in many many discussions over the last several weeks and months, so I think you'll see that look. I can't I won't comment on specific Nominations, obviously, were very closely attuned to that and are involved behind the scenes in many discussions. But I am optimistic that we can find common ground on a lot of these key areas. And to the extent that any nominee or any member of an administration or Congress takes a point of view or tries to implement policies that run counter to our core beliefs, whether it be in vaccines or other areas, we will absolutely be the first to be vocal about how that does harm and to oppose those\n\n00:46:35,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n policies. So that's been my approach going into this, again, grounded with constructive engagement and finding common ground. And that cross-partisanship. Look, at the end of the day, I think politics is about making friends and finding that common ground. It's easy to be the opposition and just oppose everything and everyone, but we take the world as we find it, and we take Congress and the White House as we find it, and we find a way to work with it.\n\n00:47:03,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n So one of the reasons that folks have gone to China for some of the assets that they're licensing, CAR-Ts or ADCs, et cetera, is because of the speed with which they can generate some early clinical data. And John Connolly has just joined because he and I were chatting a little bit about this issue. I think there are some initiatives that are going on, John, to try and address that in the US.\n\n00:47:27,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, absolutely. And I also want to thank John for just such a careful analysis of the regulatory environment and its impact on the biopharma sector. And I'm also optimistic. I'm very much looking forward to the opportunity that these changes may make. and Sam, as we were talking about the really, the Obviously, the speed at which we can do some of these clinical trials, XUS, it just really, it obviously is way ahead of what we're seeing here. And I think a lot of that has to do with the to do with regulatory agencies that have come up and looked at the gold standard of the U. S., looked at exactly what the good things that the FDA does, and implemented many of those policies with alignments with U. S. regulatory standards.\n\n00:48:13,109 [SPEAKER_3]\n and tolerances, but at the same time began to look at how we can accelerate things a little bit further. So if you look at, you know, I think many of us are familiar with clinical trials in Australia, Singapore, Denmark, many other countries, take a look at more of a risk-based approach to really speed up the early phase signal finding studies. So we are in the cancer immunotherapy space.","char_start":43387,"char_end":47683,"start_time":"00:44:36","end_time":null}

So we are in the cancer immunotherapy space.\n\n00:48:33,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I think many of you know that a cell and gene therapy trial. Signal finding study out of Penn would take about two years to really push through the idea that you have just a small signal finding study. And in that time, as an early stage biotech or as an academic, you've got 20 companies that have already done that trial in China. Much of this has to do with the way early stage trials are done in other countries outside the U. S. And that is, those six-person, 12-person signal finding studies are done really with local IRB approval under a framework that is nationally administered and reviewed. And so I think that this is something that we really have to look at now is what are the responsibilities of the local hospitals, and can we shift some of that regulatory burden of early phase signal finding studies onto more of a local review process that may be much accelerated, including other aspects like timelines, condensing timelines. This is a big, big area. That, um, that we really need to address there.\n\n00:49:34,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n There's a role for looking outside the US at other systems and what works, and then bringing that in and modifying our system. Again, I think I really am optimistic this is the time. Whereas, as John said earlier, we can use carrots to really incentivize this as opposed to continually putting up barriers.\n\n00:49:53,840 [SPEAKER_5]\n Thanks so much. That was John Connolly, CSO of the Parker Institute.\n\n00:49:59,100 [SPEAKER_5]\n Who joined us here from the audience. So we have about 10 minutes left. I'm going to ask everyone to comment on anything else that's on their mind, and then we will wrap up the show. So I'll start with you, Sam.\n\n00:50:15,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so I could do these deals quite quickly. Gilead's deal, and I'm going to focus on this China, Europe versus US issue. Gilead did it. With Leo Farm, which is not a US farm or biotech company. It's private for which I think the thing that makes it interesting that others can correct me if I'm wrong. And this is sort of thing where Tim will have all this data in his head. Um, 250 million dollars up front for a pre-clinical asset now it's an interesting asset it's a stat 6 oral stat 6 program as a whole and obviously STAT6 is the downstream of IL-4, IL-13, which is Dupixent. So the idea is interesting, but that sounds like a pretty big number for a preclinical asset. And then the other one, which is also not a US one, is AbbVie and Sincere, which was actually, they did two deals. Uh, two uh T-cell engagers deal with Sims here, which is Chinese, and the other one with AppCellera, which is a company that they had a deal with already, and um.\n\n00:51:20,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n And they're both for T-cell engages. And of course, AbbVie is in the world of T-cell engages with a myeloma drug that they're developing. I mean, the.\n\n00:51:30,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n The deal with Sincere is for a myeloma triple or a tri-specific GPRC5D, BCMA, and CD3.\n\n00:51:40,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n So these are the deals that I saw. Again, it's just first few deals of the year and not US companies. And I think that doesn't really say anything, I think. The US biotech still win the largest share of deals, even if you look at the big rise in 2024. But it's something that we're going to have to keep assessing and analyzing going forward.\n\n00:52:05,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n And did you, Mike, did you have any comments on the Gilead deal?\n\n00:52:10,090 [SPEAKER_6]\n Yeah, the 125 is definitely a high number for preclinical. I'm sure we all know that.\n\n00:52:16,890 [SPEAKER_4]\n It uh follows off some of the themes we were talking about because literally we just weeks before Uh, J and J did a deal with the Chinese company for the oral stat six. And they paid a much smaller amount. I think it was like 30 or something like that.","char_start":47383,"char_end":51532,"start_time":"00:48:33","end_time":null}

And they paid a much smaller amount. I think it was like 30 or something like that.\n\n00:52:35,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, maybe someone thinks that the drug is better or uh, maybe J and J just went cheaper, but uh, J and J went to China to do theirs. And Gilead went to do Leo. You know. Whatever they want it and they paid up for it. So, um, that's a. Uh, That's good. I do like that deal for Gilead though, because they have the stat six and they also have an IRAC four, I believe, from Nurex too. So if you've been following, everybody wants an oral psoriasis or atopic dermatitis pill because there are not great ones at all.\n\n00:53:10,640 [SPEAKER_4]\n Good.\n\n00:53:11,830 [SPEAKER_5]\n Any other closing remarks, John?\n\n00:53:15,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I would just say, you know, look, this is the start of the year.\n\n00:53:22,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think there are reasons to be optimistic here. And despite the uncertainty that we all entered into at JPM and, you know, my glass is still half full and looking forward to some great stuff happening.\n\n00:53:37,350 [SPEAKER_5]\n Great. Well, thank you. Before we close out the show, I just want to give a shout out to my friends over at Omega on the Scorpion deal. Congratulations on that. And to mention that the founders of the CEO sisterhood, Julia Owens and you and Sheila Garathi, have done something. Great things for the industry. So I want to give them a shout out as well. Um, So we're about to wrap up and I would like to thank my co-hosts: John Maragonori, Michael Yee, and Sam Fazelli, and our guest speaker, John Crowley, CEO of Bio, and then John Connolly for coming up. Thank you all for a great discussion.\n\n00:54:22,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n Really appreciate your insights. Looking forward to the rest of the year, I think. Potentially a little bit of optimism. John Crowley, would you like to make closing remarks?\n\n00:54:33,260 [SPEAKER_5]\n Wrap up the show.\n\n00:54:35,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure, Daphne. Again, thank you for having me. I'm happy to join on a more regular basis. And look, I echo John's optimism. I think the glass is more than half full and probably pretty clean, too. And it's been a challenge for four years. You look at when we reach the peak of our biotech market, everything that we've struggled with. Um, despite tremendous science, you know, technology is moving forward. Um, I do think, for instance, you'll see a much more receptive Federal Trade Commission that will understand the importance of recycling capital and ideas in our industry through M&A and large business transactions. One of the things that we're going to emphasize, I'll just note as well, this year, is that while we do a lot and we're based in Washington for a reason, of course, so much of biotechnology is happening around the country. While we have our epicenters and Boston and the Bay Area and a couple of other places. When I travel around the country, I see so much optimism. And when I meet with our governors in particular. Everybody wants biotech in their state.\n\n00:55:37,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n They want it to grow. So one of the initiatives we're going to launch this year is a program I'm calling Bio on the American Road. And I'm going to go on an almost monthly basis to spend two or two and a half days in emerging cities and emerging biotechnology centers of excellence. We're actually going to pilot this in early February in Denver, where we're going to meet with state leaders. We're going to go on morning talk shows. We're going to tell very human stories of people locally who have been saved through the miracles of our medicine. and people who need our miracles for they or their children to be saved. We're going to go to children's hospitals. We're going to go to member companies, you know, emerging biotech companies with members of Congress to showcase the work being done in their districts and states. So, you know, we're going to do Denver and cities.","char_start":51232,"char_end":55374,"start_time":"00:52:16","end_time":null}

I rarely hear anybody ever say, 'If ever'—that God, I hate that biotech company. That made that medicine that saved my kid's life. No, never. They need more of it. And they want more of it. And I think that's. The background that we will weigh into as we kind of continue to deliver our medicines and hope to people. So I am optimistic. And I think while we'll have challenges, no doubt. On the policy front and things we need to fix, like in the IRA. I'm optimistic that with some smart and bold change, we'll be in a better place. So that's our job and that's my vision. But I. I ran a biotech company for 20 years, right? I've got to be an optimist.\n\n00:57:08,300 [SPEAKER_5]\n Hmm. Well said. Thank you, John, and we would love to have you on here again on a regular basis.

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode. please go to biotechhangout. com. So. A few hours ago, we had some breaking news.\n\n00:00:26,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n On the obesity front. Brian, you want to kind of describe the news that broke this morning with Novo? Happy to hear other comments.\n\n00:00:34,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, it was actually a slow week for [company] specific things up until this morning. Obviously, there were some pretty big changes at the federal government level and HHS level. But, you know, this morning, Novo announced that it seems to be like the big data point for the week.\n\n00:00:52,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n From companies. They were pretty big this morning, up about 7. 5% right now. Almost 10% at the Open. Uh, and this is because they announced some early data from one of their next-gen obesity programs is called Amicretin. And this drug targets both GLP-1, which is the mechanism underpinning the drugs that we all know, like Somaglutide, Trisapatide, but it's also targeting amylin receptors. unique in in uh clinical development in this respect. And what we got today was data on once-weekly sub-Q administration and it was exploring weight loss over over 36 weeks. Um, sort of complicated escalation into every 12 weeks, starting at 1. 25 megs, going to 20 megs by 36 weeks. And the key takeaway here that people are pulling is that by 36 weeks, those who have escalated to 20– 20 milligrams and stayed on treatment saw a 22% weight loss. Um and you know, this is this is on a you know, sort of weight loss per week basis, the headline number, looks to be the fastest that we've seen in studies so far.\n\n00:01:59,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tresapatide, as an example, gets about this much weight loss over a year and a half. Half period. And even like Amgen and Viking, earlier phase one studies, they showed like 14-ish percent at six months. And so this is definitely occurring faster than those sort of hurdles that were set as the prior bar for phase one studies. So I think in some respects. This does set a new bar, however, there are a couple of things to consider about the results. This is as this is really as an as treated result— this is only considering results for people who followed the planned dosing schedule for the full trial period without any treatment discontinuations— and the second thing is there really wasn't any meaningful tolerability data presented. Novo just kind of said it was consistent with increase. There's therapies. And I kind of think there's a little bit of a cop out. Roshan sort of done the same thing last year for their CT996 data, the initial PR. passed off tolerability profile as consistent with ingredients. Stock went up on that because the weight loss data was really good. But then when they presented the actual tolerability data, it looked much more on the top. End of increments in the stock got hit on it.","char_start":0,"char_end":3244,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

End of increments in the stock got hit on it.\n\n00:03:00,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n So look, and I've also been pretty critical of how AMG had presented their phase one data. And then, in phase two, it really kind of fell off on efficacy. And I guess I kind of see the same potential issue here since the discontinuations aren't counted in these results— any meaningful rate of discontinuation has implications for both the tolerability and efficacy side. If you were to do a true ITT analysis or take a conservative of view for imputing missing data, you know, that 22% weight loss is very likely to be overstated. And then, on the top of the implications for this continuation to have for efficacy, obviously high discontinuations would be. uh a bit of a concern i don't know that chasing raw weight loss improvements at this point in the market is of huge value i think you know people are interested in getting this weight loss without the nausea and the vomiting and the gi tolerability issues um that that we see coming along with it so um that's kind of brian i didn't see the press release but do we have a sense of the n n size of the as treated versus the intent to treat and what percent were not included in the no that's and i think that's the i mean i think that's why it's a key question is it got it discontinuation is it 15 discontinuation\n\n00:04:08,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n yeah it was 15 discontinuation that would be really bad you know it was two percent that's probably then it's good Yeah.\n\n00:04:15,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I'll just highlight this is the same mechanism in which they're developing the oral behind it. So depending on the full analysis when we see it. It could. give a signal for the oral. talk.\n\n00:04:27,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. Sam, any comments? You've been following the obesity market pretty closely.\n\n00:04:31,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, Brian did a fantastic job. So I'm not going to comment on the detail. But the odd thing here, Chris, is this was a safety and tolerability study. And we didn't get any safety and tolerability comments.\n\n00:04:45,849 [SPEAKER_3]\n To Brian's point, we all know that this is the critical element here. The reason people don't lose as much weight, et cetera, is because they come off the drug. So is it a cop-out? Why is it? Why don't they just do it? Is it because they didn't have enough time to analyze the data? But they obviously know that the numbers are similar to what you expect. Anyway, so that's that. What I would say also is that this is a weight loss that seems to be just a tad better. But remember, I'm not in the game of 23%, 24%, 25%. I think we're— I think we're scratching or hitting the ceiling here. And I've been saying that, and I may be proven wrong with the next readouts from Lily, but this is similar. It is slightly better at the same time point compared to retratrotide, which is Lily's.\n\n00:05:36,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n triple G, so GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. Of course, the comparative analysis of discontinuation rates and side effect profile and all that is not possible. because we haven't got enough data or any data to compare to. So, however, it does look slightly better. And I think both, at least in this trial, in the amicritin trial. they did not have lifestyle changes. So the actual weight loss relative to placebo was 24%, which is a chunky number. But anyway, again, 24, 23, 25, I don't care anymore. And then, of course, the element that is also worth talking about is the read-through to Zealand, who is developing Petrolenatide, which they're also doing just in the single-agent amylin drug, and developing it as a combo with the GLP-1. Now, remember, this is a monomolecular. So this is a molecule that hits both mechanisms. Whereas Kagrisema, which is kind of similar to what they've got here, was was just a two separate, an amylin agonist and a GLP-1 agonist.","char_start":2946,"char_end":7067,"start_time":"00:03:00","end_time":null}

Whereas Kagrisema, which is kind of similar to what they've got here, was was just a two separate, an amylin agonist and a GLP-1 agonist.\n\n00:06:44,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n And maybe the difference, if you wanted to talk about a difference, between the two is this. Between the two readouts from Novo is this issue of a combo versus a single molecule. If that's the case, which I don't. Thing is, then, of course, that would have negative connotations for Zealand. But I see this as a positive read through for Zealand. And that stock is up a little less, obviously, about 4% there.\n\n00:07:10,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, just to, I mean, highlight the ups and downs of this obesity market from a valuation standpoint. You know, Novo is still carrying an over $300 billion market value, but even with the uptick in the stock today. It's still trading below. Uh, the the data release and August 2023, when they had the select data for cardiovascular outcomes. For the first time. It went over 90 per share at that point and even traded up to 140. So it just shows you, even with positive news, it's really hard to recover with some of the other dynamics that have been happening vis-a-vis Lilly in this marketplace. But speaking of kind of the public markets and valuation and sentiment. Tim, I know, you know, post end of year, there's been a lot of reports and analyses, including yours from Stiefel. Just give us a. you know, post, you know, a week after JPM ended, the current public market sentiment, IPO capital markets. Would love to hear your perspective on that.\n\n00:08:10,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yep. Thank you. So, you know. going into the J . P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. For three months, the market was down almost 20%, at least as you would measure by the XPI.\n\n00:08:22,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n And. So I think a lot of folks were hoping that we'd see a nice bounce at the conference. That really didn't materialize, despite the fact that we had some pretty reasonable M &A announcements there. And if you start calling investors, what you hear is a great reluctance to participate in sort of basic activities involving the capital markets, like doing a wall cross, like people like, no, I don't feel like I'm going to do a wall cross this week. I don't really care what your pipe deal is. I think we're just going to hold pat. And so.\n\n00:08:53,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, what's interesting in the last week is actually the XBI is up. So the XBI is up like 5%. And, you know, I've been.\n\n00:09:03,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n calling investors like hey you're like obviously someone's buying like this looks really good what's going on and uh you know sometimes things aren't exactly what they seem And so apparently there's a fund or two that are actually under significant pressure right now. that are engage very heavy short covering. So once you know, like one fund is short covering. uh you know that creates concern about squeeze and so you know yesterday the market was up quite a bit And so this is not. To my knowledge, and I'd love to hear what others have to say. A rally, uh, that is caused by, you know, you know, a giant inflow of fresh money into mutual funds or anything like that. But rather, I think something more technical is going on. So fortunately, for better or for worse, sentiment is not great. That said, you know, we're seeing good IPOs get done. So like, Ascentage got done last night, although the pricing of the Ascentage IPO deal was not what people might have hoped it was. And I think there will be some more IPOs that will be getting done in the weeks ahead.\n\n00:10:08,150 [SPEAKER_4]\n In addition to that, the follow-on market has been functioning pretty well. So, for example, Stiefel was one of the underwriters on the DISC Medicine follow-on. That took place this week. That day was actually upsized.\n\n00:10:20,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Depending on the stock, the market seems to be just fine.\n\n00:10:24,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n The venture capital side of the market is very different.

They've been able to raise money from LPs.\n\n00:10:38,010 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, the outlooks seem positive. It's just this funk that's kind of hit some of these public market hedge funds that is notable.\n\n00:10:46,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, look, I think. I think you were quoted in an article that Arda Oral of uh one of the accounting firms highlighted that we can remove the cautious moniker from cautious optimism. But I mean, look, I think that. Look, there's always been a lot of dry powder on the VC front on the sidelines. And I think, you know, we've talked about this on other Hangouts that, you know, there are investment periods. And you have to kind of put that money to work. And we know this phenomenon of, you know, larger rounds to proven management teams. But I do think that, whether you think the recovery is going to be in full this year or next year, VC time horizons are longer. I think there is a feeling that it's safer to deploy that capital, you know, albeit with a better lens of efficiency of capital deployment. A little bit more discernment on, you know, the right targets and the right clinical and regulatory strategies. So I think on the, you know, look, VC is always a lagging indicator, both on the downside and admitting that there's a problem and that we need to adjust.\n\n00:11:54,790 [SPEAKER_0]\n But also, you know, they're also a precursor on the upside, right? They're going to be looking at this. And I look at like short covering as. An example of certain investors who are realizing that there's more risk that the market's going to raise all boats and valuations are going to start to increase. So I think it is a little bit of a signal. In my mind, that uh there's concern among investors that um you know maybe this down market is over and then on the follow-on side you mentioned you know I've always seen follow-ons as you're either doing it from a a place of desperation and you're going to run out of cash. You need to raise money, even if it dilutes current shareholders and it's not at the valuations. Typically when it's from a position of strength. Those deals do get done, right? Because these are the best of the lot. They have healthy valuations. That's why they want to do a follow-on to shore up their balance sheet. Any comments about kind of the discernment of which ones— are they the higher quality names that you see are going for the follow-ons?\n\n00:12:58,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and I'm happy to cover it. I was going to talk a bit, and we can cover it later— the Wall Street Journal article that discussed some of the sentiment currently in the venture capital market. Chris, completely agree with you. And there's definitely a big difference—uh, at least now— and certainly a JP Morgan between public and private investors, and especially private investors that are focused on earlier stage, seed, series A, and series B type of investment. The one thing that is, yes, there's some optimism now. There are less mega rounds. People are actually looking for new innovation and making investments into more novel companies. But the one consensus certainly still is— as it was last year— is there is interest mostly in the clinical stage companies because, again, investors are wary of risk. And last year, they made sure to protect themselves from risk by joining mega rounds. And now they are protecting themselves from risk. They're going a little bit outside the comfort zone for.\n\n00:14:02,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Going back into areas such as oncology, there was too much excitement, too much focus last year on obesity and some neuro. So people are turning back to oncology. um and some novel mechanisms now but again uh partnering that oncology interest together with with clinical stage assets to de-risk the investments.","char_start":10833,"char_end":14875,"start_time":"00:10:24","end_time":null}

And I think part of this is also the China licensing trade and the idea of fast followers and good targets. that are getting interest. And look, I don't have the data to support this, Tim, maybe you do, but I tend to see it's in the hyperbolic bull markets where you see platform valuations start to— really increase. And I think it may be a while before, with the exception of selected cases, where you're going to see the level of exuberance we saw circa 2018 to 2021 around platforms. So I do think it's going to be data-driven, product-driven stories. And when are you going to be in the clinic with clinical proof of concept data to drive? you know, valuations or to be able to take a company public. But, you know, the other side of this, Tim, I want you to comment a little bit on the deals, the M &A licensing. Sam, I know you're group has done some work as well. But Tim, you've highlighted this idea of the ITCI exceptionalism and that you are maybe a little more optimistic about the high flow of deals on the M &A licensing front.\n\n00:15:32,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then Sam, I'd love you to comment as well.\n\n00:15:35,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I mean, steeple is a— you know, Good. financial advisor on M &A. But, you know, we're one of a number, right?\n\n00:15:44,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n I assume. Whatever we're seeing, other advisors are seeing as well. um Our M &A and licensing deal flow right now is at a historic high. In other words, the pipeline of projects we're working on is very high. At the moment. Pharma is active. Across the board, you name it, have the Roche.\n\n00:16:05,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n Novartis, they're all in the market working on transactions right now.\n\n00:16:11,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n This notion that the ITCI deal was like this one-off, I'm just sort of scratching my head saying, 'I guess all of your portfolio didn't get bought on the Monday of JP Morgan, but it's going to be a pretty interesting year.' It is a very different time. So like. My portfolio includes plenty of China deals, India deals. It's not the same market that it used to be, but it is a very active deal market right now. I think this is going to be a pretty strong year, assuming that like—I'm not just like this one-off. I'm pretty sure I'm not. I usually like in the past, I don't know. I remember like 2008, the financial crisis. I'm like, 'God,' my pipeline is just not very good. And like, I knew that Lehman Brothers had gone down pretty soon. It became clear like everyone had a bad pipeline. So I think it's a pretty strong year.\n\n00:17:02,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, I think you've either put out or are putting out a report soon on licensing deals, and then maybe following that up with M &A. What is your data telling you and what's your sentiment around dealmaking?\n\n00:17:14,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n yeah thank you chris just just before i just give a few headline uh numbers tim one of the things that i heard johnson and johnson saying it's the only company that's reported so far was that the the interstellar deal in terms of size was an outlier for them for them right do not expect deals of this size going forward pharma companies give you these kind of things, and then they go and do a deal. So are you suggesting that when you comment about InterCellular, that we should not assume that that was a one-off at least it was 28 for this year or do you do or when when you're referring to mna kind of backlog or or or portfolio they that's size agnostic I mean, I do think by definition, sort of $10 billion plus deals are relatively rare.\n\n00:18:07,890 [SPEAKER_4]\n So for any company, whether it's Shante or anyone else, yeah, that's not something one should. Expect you know, frequently, maybe one a year or one every couple years, but what I can say is, just like in what I am looking at— Either I'm working on personally or I can see it in deals that I'm aware of.","char_start":14575,"char_end":18795,"start_time":"00:14:28","end_time":null}

Type plus transactions in some cases, significantly billion-dollar plus transactions that are in the works at the moment. So it's going to be a like, it's going to be a pretty active time. You know, whoever's out there short covering, like they're actually pretty smart. This is not a good time to be short. This market. These are great. Sorry, Luba, go ahead.\n\n00:18:50,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n I was just going to just provide a few numbers. I agree with everyone here in terms of the increase in M &A, and it certainly will continue in 2025. Just some numbers. So, for example, if you look at the number of M &A that have deals with upfront of over 75 million that rose from just, we had only six in 2023, to 17 last year. And if you look at the highest M &A activity that was in 2020, and that was 20 deals, that we're over 75 up front. So that's right now, again, nobody has a crystal ball, but it's projected to go over that 2020 number of 20 deals.\n\n00:19:36,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and then on the licensing data, so we've been, I personally have been collecting licensing data since 2000. I'm sorry if I'm aging myself here. But then, on the Bloomberg terminal, we've got data that goes back to 2011. And of course, he says the same thing as what Tim put out earlier, that China is a significantly higher number. We calculate about 9% of all agreements. Remember, we try and cut it a little bit more, thinking about pharma companies as opposed to the whole universe. In fact, 20 the fourth quarter was that was the busiest in terms of um deals with Chinese biotechs. The 19 deals we counted now. Why is that? Because folks have been thinking—gosh, new administration is coming in— and we need to get these deals done in case Brad is right. Our friend Brad has a view that, in the end, they're going to start blocking these. Or is it simply because the opportunities are there, we're going to take them?\n\n00:20:38,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, I, I don't know. I think I think, whatever it is, it seems to be going that way. And actually, I was hearing, um, listening to the read-out-loud um podcast from Stat today, whether we're talking about their feeling around the JP Morgan, and I'd love to hear what others said, I wasn't there, about lots of people are continuing to just spend quite a lot of time looking for assets. Assets are assets, right? And then. Interestingly, in terms of upfront payments, et cetera, some of the biggest deals were for Chinese assets when they were licensed.\n\n00:21:11,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n And the value, the total value continues to go up. We can't see any difference between if the assets coming out of China is coming out of the US or Europe. So, and there's been a little movement in the type of, it's interesting to Luba's point, in the type of therapeutic areas, cancer continues to be in the 20% to 30%, so about a third of the deals. And of course, you did have that big jump in INI recently on the back of the CAR-Ts in lupus, etc. So I think this the story: but that we are, I'm pretty sure, continuing to see some Chinese deals here. I think what we'll come on to talk about is: Is the administration actually creating a world, which is up for discussion, that the science is going to continue to be weighted toward other countries as opposed to US? We'll get back to that.\n\n00:22:05,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great. Well, good overview of the markets, both public and private. Thanks, everybody, for the contribution there. Sam, obviously, there wasn't a lot of data news this week, but with the Trump administration, you want to highlight what's impacting our sector from what his first actions are resulting in?\n\n00:22:25,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, I'm trying to get my head around, Chris, whether some of the moves are just normal moves or atypical— or atypical of a new uh administration coming in and my Washington colleagues tell me that, at least with regards to the NIH, for instance, and the freeze on pretty much everything where they look at it, no more, no meetings, no travel, nothing is. Uh, isn't typical; it's a bit beyond the level of what you would expect during a transition.","char_start":18495,"char_end":22964,"start_time":"00:18:28","end_time":null}

Uh, isn't typical; it's a bit beyond the level of what you would expect during a transition.\n\n00:22:54,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n But their view is, and I hope they're right, that this block that's been put on any activity, all travel has been cancelled, advisory meetings have been cancelled, that it is all to do with just the transition. The reason I'm worried is because of what RFK has said, because he's on his way to potentially being the head of the HHS. And previously, back in November 23, he was very clear about, you know, what did he say? I'm going to say to NIH scientists, go. God bless you all. Thank you for your public service. We're going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years. I mean, this is one particular comment, right? I don't know how much of it to believe, etc. Interestingly, it ties in with the WHO withdrawal, right? which a lot of the World Health Organization withdrawal activities are to do with infectious disease and information sharing.\n\n00:23:53,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n I really can't tell where this is going to end. I'm sure you guys have got a better view of this, actually, being in the US. On the WHO front.\n\n00:24:03,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Look, the money that the US spent over the past 12 months is about $700 million. Can I just say that's a quarter of the overspend on Air Force One, the new Air Force One. It's nothing. What is the value of this? How much does the US gain by blocking and not continuing to support the WHO? And of course, one of the issues is that a lot of the activity that was being supported by the US was on polio eradication, tetanus, flu work, etc.\n\n00:24:34,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Will be in limbo at the minute, and um, let's see how that all pans out. Is it all a negotiating tactic to cut that 700 million down to 500 million, and a lot of it was discretionary, not because the US is a member of the WHO funding bodies. So, interesting week. I hope it's not going to lead to this continued assault on science.\n\n00:24:58,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, look, I mean, and Luba, I want to hear from you, especially related to the FDA hiring freeze. You know, look, clearly, usually you typically see some kind of grace period, right, where it's not just an immediate directive to stop activities, travel, right? I mean, even people who might have had offers prepared, they have to rescind those or stop those offers from going forward.\n\n00:25:25,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n I do think that this will have the effect of everybody reassessing and almost having to justify activities. I mean, look, the simple overriding messages that I'm seeing coming out of the Trump administration are number one: being pro-business, right? And that he wants to support business leaders— this is you know clear and we'll talk a little bit about the whole Larry Ellison and mRNA, but you know, clearly having all of the you know tech titans at his inauguration. I did listen to his WEF comments and Q&A. Number one is pro-business, and number two is pulling out waste and inefficiency. Uh, and you know, trying to do you know more effective means now, of course, we have to look at secondarily what does that mean from a policy standpoint. All that, but I, I feel like this is more of a tactic to drive the intended consequence, and to some degree, I think the who withdrawal is similar.\n\n00:26:33,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n Right. I don't think anybody is going to realistically ignore the United States. It's less about me, I'm going to take my ball and go home, and not play with you. But okay, if you're going to engage with us, it's going to be on our terms, right? And not, you know, the world terms that we can debate whether that's the right thing politically, whether we should have a more collegial and optimistic, but in my opinion, I think this is a tactic that's being employed in the near term to try to ultimately get more influence and. You know, more of a you know, seat at the table, if you will, you know, on various policies moving forward, you know, RFK Jr. aside. But Luba, we'd love to hear your thoughts on the news that you've heard come out of this week.","char_start":22664,"char_end":26967,"start_time":"00:22:54","end_time":null}

I've been reading a number of articles and listening to people that have, including for our program, where we are in contact with the FDA.\n\n00:27:32,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n And people are really worried. Those biotech companies that are in discussions with the FDA, they're actually not hearing back from the FDA or they are getting a sense that people are not paying attention. But that is just this week. Actually, as a matter of fact, FDA has expedited a lot of their reviews at the end of the year. So a lot of companies were able to receive the information that they did, the request, and a lot of their conversations were expedited. At the end of December right before the Christmas break. So that has to be balanced with just a pause. And I do believe it's a short pause right now as the administration is reprioritizing its activities. And I do agree that, from what I'm seeing and from what I'm hearing from transition team and others, is that. It's going to be trending in a positive direction and the outcome is going to be more pro-business, pro-biotech. So I would.\n\n00:28:33,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n I encourage companies to give an extra few weeks for a lot of this to be ironed out in the proper direction to be set. The same thing, by the way, with NIH grants. I myself am in the NIH review committee. I understand that that has been paused. With a lot of other thoughts on that as well. But again, this is just a pause to reassess priorities, which I think at the end will be beneficial to the industry.\n\n00:29:01,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I'll just add that, you know, the Stat News did a, at JP Morgan with David Ricks, the Lilly CEO. And again, he met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. I mean, of any sector, I thought pharma might still hit the ire. Right of this administration, but it seems to be he had very positive things to say about that, so I think that, from a large pharma standpoint, that was encouraging to me. But Tim, I mean, even NIH, uh, funding this has been, you know, the ante to drive our industry to some degree. With grants and getting drug discovery and all of that. Your take on some of these actions from the Trump administration.\n\n00:29:42,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, I like to look at things in a historical context. I'm a bit of a history nut.\n\n00:29:48,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n If you go back, say, like 500 years, we didn't really have these ideas of science. We didn't have a government that had a science agency, much less the United States in existence.\n\n00:30:00,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, Galileo eventually came up with like some really cool ideas. And, you know, he was threatened with either get burned at the stake or you can be imprisoned for life. Right. So there's always been this— this resistance to scientific progress. And if you go more recently, in the 1800s, you saw all sorts of anti-science movements. You had all sorts of pseudoscience, things like mesmerism, hypnotism, you know, using electricity as medicine were very popular and were, you know, politicians frequently referenced those. So what we're seeing today, which is, you know, a U. S. politician who's a populist, attempting to appeal to anti-scientific instincts, particularly with respect to vaccines, is nothing new.\n\n00:30:48,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n What is concerning is that the scientific progress that we've seen in our industry has just been absolutely stunning.","char_start":26667,"char_end":30430,"start_time":"00:27:16","end_time":null}

It's unlikely that people inside large pharma companies right now are doing a ton of basic science. So most of that gets funded. Through the academic institutions and the NIH, at least in the United States, if you look at the history of China, you know most people don't sort of think about but in the cultural revolution, China was kind of going through their own populist movement. So they were busy, you know, executing academics, putting them to work in, you know, communes, burning books. And now China's the opposite, right? So China's all about science and they've created a much more capitalistic environment all of a sudden, we're seeing a huge amount of innovation coming out of it. China. And so I'm very sympathetic to Sam's point. Which is like you couldn't pick a worse moment for the U. S. to decide to go through one of these periodic populist anti-science things. I will say that if you look at the long kind of arc of history, science is winning, and I don't think the Trump administration is really going to change anything there.\n\n00:32:02,400 [SPEAKER_4]\n But it is, you know. An inconvenient moment to have cancellation of NIH study sections and so on.\n\n00:32:12,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And Tim, I, you know, I personally, I try to avoid using science as science, anti-science, and cutting it across political lines. I think, look, we've done a lot of things that we thought were right and we turned out to be wrong. I mean, I think the scientific method and always gathering more data— where we have retrospectives with new data— to say, 'Wow, maybe that wasn't right,' or 'Maybe our thesis around that molecular pathway was wrong,' or 'Maybe we didn't realize the safety off-target effects of this particular class of drugs,' right? But I think the idea is that Regulators have a role to try to vet and determine safety and efficacy. And again, RFK vaccines aside, I think everything that I've seen in recent weeks is that people are drawing a very clear distinction of drug development, which has never been easy. and that there's no real suggestion there that people are trying to inhibit. The ability to do good clinical testing for efficacy and safety to get drugs approved.\n\n00:33:13,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n Now, on the public health side, that's a different category from where most of us operate, right? As drug developers. And so I think that I'm going to be looking at what is the ultimate result, right, of all the political rhetoric, because I think the people who are being put in place, they're not anti-science. They're not. They're not, you know, I mean many of these are scientists, they've gone to get their PhDs and MDs, you know, like, you know, others on the on the left end of the spectrum. So I don't know. I think I would like to see, just really, just look at data and the actions of things. As an industry, we should work harder to avoid the political rhetoric of science, anti-science, and going back to the dark ages of Galileo. I don't think that is what I'm seeing in terms of some of the folks who are communicating around this. But no, I think point well taken. I think it'll be interesting to watch. You know, all of this moving forward, um.\n\n00:34:11,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n And Chris, just a comment. I'm not so sure if you actually sit down and read what some of these folks coming into the administration have actually written. But yeah, I mean, there's not a consensus that we should. You know, exit the business of being a scientifically driven country. But I think it's also very clear, based on the comments that I've already made, that the Trump administration is essentially trying to throw sands in the gears of some of these governmental institutions, you know, arguably for good reasons. I personally don't see it.\n\n00:34:48,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n All I'm saying is, at the very moment that our geopolitical competitors ramping things up.

Maybe we should be looking at it a little bit differently.\n\n00:34:57,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, I think part of it is a little bit of the, are we doing everything right and optimally, or are we doing a lot of things wrong? And I think that's the spectrum that I see is. Where each of us sits along the spectrum of things we can improve and do better on. And look, there's different tactics for that. One is to stop doing things and then try to rebuild it from scratch. And I don't think anybody's advocating for that. But I think there is the spectrum of. How much are we getting right versus how much are we getting wrong? And can we be doing a better job? And I think that's a healthier way to look at it. And I think, look, I expect the administration outgoing is going to say, like, you know, Califf, we did a lot of great things and we did a lot of things right.\n\n00:35:41,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, there's going to be people on the other side of that say, 'Wow, we think we can see improvements.' I mean, just picking on FDA. uh, which you know we don't like to talk about as an industry, but it'll be interesting to see what you know, changes McCary might implement and, you know, how that changes. You know, look, most of us who've been in the industry for a long time recognize where the FDA is— not optimized and is not efficiently tuned. And this goes back to hierarchy versus divisions, the expertise that are within the divisions. Right. You know, the inconsistent feedback on [to], you know, biotechs and sponsors right along the way. And so, you know, look, it could go in the other direction. It could get worse. But I think, you know, there is a possibility that we could see some improvements come out, you know, of these of these changes. But let's move on. There wasn't a lot of news, but there was some revenue, fourth quarter Carvicti. Uh, Brian, you wanna uh cover that and Sam, if you can comment on on this uh car tbcma.\n\n00:36:44,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, yeah. Thanks for coming back to me. So yeah, JJ reported the other day, you know, generally not a very controversial quarter from what I can tell. But one of the things in sort of this mid-cap and large-cap biotech sector that was a talking point was that they reported $3. 34 billion in carbon. These sales so this is their BCMA cart key that they have partnered with Legend for multiple myeloma, and this this pretty handily beat expectations, and has now had you know really a very successful launch, I think the best car t to date so you know outpacing like Descarta in um large belt large B-cell lymphoma. Now myeloma has impressively become one of the largest indications out there because I know been with Celgene back in the day, but I remember when they were first launching with Alamed. And people were questioning if it would even be worth the cost of marketing. And now, for frame of reference, the other impressive number J &J put up was quarterly sales of Darcel X that were reported to be over 3 billion.\n\n00:37:45,640 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, you know, this was also for myeloma and it's now the biggest brand J &J has ever had. So myeloma is now delivering to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in history— the biggest brand ever. But back to Carvicti, there's a bit of a potential competitive dynamic here with Gilead and their partner, Arcelex, which has a BCMA car key that looks very similar. In terms of efficacy, Carvecti, at least in late-line patients, without some of the significant neurological side effects that have emerged with Carvecti. So, just to frame up the debate on that Jane Legend side of the story, there's an argument that they are becoming so entrenched in the landscape of myeloma CAR-T treatment that Gilead and Darcelix are really going to be too far behind to catch up. Carvicti has controlled survival.\n\n00:38:34,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n We lost him there, I think, Chris.\n\n00:38:36,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, did you guys lose?

Oh, man.\n\n00:38:37,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n He was on such a roll, too. Yeah, he was. I know. Let me pick up. Getting excited. Let me pick up from where he was going. Yeah, please, Sam, go ahead. So Carvect is the only CAR-T in the space that's got overall survival data. And, you know, our conversations with physicians, and surveys that we've been conducting all tell us that, at the end of the day, the hell up— I mean, I don't want to say it this way, but I think ABECMA will be history, at least in terms of meaningful sales. That's the equivalent. BCMA CAR-T from, or the competitive BCMA CAR-T from Bristol-Myers. So CAR-VICT is doing amazingly well. And of course it is. of a China deal. It's one of the original China deals, I would say. I think it was, I can't remember exactly when it was signed, but the first time we got the data at ASCO back in 2017 or 18. Most people thought he was all made up, which of course didn't turn out to be the case. And the competitive angle is that Arcelex is coming in now with Gilead with a very strong partner.\n\n00:39:40,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n Gilead is not to be sniffed at in the CAR T space. And it'd be very interesting to see how this battle for not efficacy, they're both super effective. I mean, you're talking about 90 plus percent overall response rates, very deep minimal residual disease impact, et cetera. It's on the side effect profile, and there's this argument between the two well— between the two worlds of Carvicti versus Arcelex, which of course doesn't have as much data as Carvicti.\n\n00:40:11,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n That Arcelexa's safety profile is better, that you might be able to deal with that easier for patients. But at the end of the day, they both have to contend with bispecific. That are coming along, and I have to say there is a lot of interest in pushing those by specifics earlier. They're off the shelf, you can take them to a two-patient community center without much worry. So it's going to be very interesting to see how this all pans out. And this year is going to be another year where we get a whole bunch of updates from both sides with regards to delayed neurotoxicity side effects or something else. But this is certainly an interesting world of CAR-T where it has become more and more usable and outpatient, etc. So really, it was a surprise beat again in the fourth quarter they beat in the third quarter too. So you know, this is all great for multiple myeloma patients.\n\n00:41:07,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and just to emphasize what Brian was talking about, yeah, when I joined Celgene, it was the year they were launching Revlimid and just how that whole pipeline of multiple myeloma has grown. Over the last 15 years or so has been pretty remarkable. And the crazy thing is it's an orphan drug, right? I think it's the second or third most high hematologic malignancy. But I think that sector did what Genentech did for solid tumor oncology. Right to show that you know it doesn't take much to drive a you know tens of billions of dollars of value in biotech if you have kind of a good therapy for you know. So at that time, there was almost nothing to treat. So really cool to see how.\n\n00:41:48,630 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, Chris, unfortunately, though, what you just said means that it's one of the toughest markets to model. Because of the combinations, endless combinations you can have and different lines of therapy. And Brian's back, right?\n\n00:42:03,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n I am.\n\n00:42:04,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Could you hear us? Was I doing a good job, Brian?\n\n00:42:09,779 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know the space better than I do even, so I'm sure you did a good job. I couldn't hear it here for like two minutes, but I'm sure you picked up very well. All right.\n\n00:42:17,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, Brian, we're going to go to the next topic, which is there's been a lot of discussion and topics and articles around AI. And obviously, part of the Trump communication again, which is kind of emphasizing the pro-business and pro-embrace of new technology. He had Larry Ellison talk about mRNA with Sam Altman and Masa San of SoftBank to put $100 billion.

One of these big headlines that's been picked up is this $500 billion infrastructure project that is being worked on with Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank.\n\n00:43:09,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh no, did we lose Brian again? To this.\n\n00:43:15,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh bummer. Can you hear me now?\n\n00:43:18,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, we can hear you. Yep.\n\n00:43:20,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n So $500 billion effort, you're saying it echoes the cancer moonshot.\n\n00:43:25,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay.\n\n00:43:28,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so, you know, basically, throughout my career, I've sort of heard this recurrent visionary claim many times, whether it's Biden.\n\n00:43:38,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n And even within industry, right? I mean, we're sort of used to some grandiose statements that are likely. Uh or if not, certainly overstating the complexity of biology and, within industry, we sort of uh maybe take more exception when it, when it's tech, CEOs doing it rather than sort of our own kin within industry. But look, I think this is a great thing. These goals are important, investment into, trying to develop mRNA for cancer vaccines. I mean, it's not going to happen at the speed um that that is being promised here. But investment is good, and I think it's like very clear that investment in biomedical innovation really has moved the needle for people and will continue to. So you know, sort of, have love-hate with these sort of grandiose statements. Because look, it helps move capital into the sector that will ultimately help people. Um, you know, the promises that get made behind it. I i think uh, you know, I worry about their their exaggeration.\n\n00:44:33,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is this who we would have expected to be the spokesperson for this, Larry Ellison? How did that come about? I'm not as familiar with his investment history or knowledge of this space.\n\n00:44:45,709 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't know.\n\n00:44:49,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, I think we lost Brian again. All right, well, hey, Sam. Yeah.\n\n00:44:54,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Brian is having tech issues.\n\n00:44:57,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe you should stop having to go at tech. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sam, I mean, you've followed this AI space and there's been some other communications this week. What's your take on all this?\n\n00:45:07,910 [SPEAKER_3]\n So, Larry, listen, I mean, Yeah. As Brian was so succinctly putting it, this tech CEO is talking about healthcare. To one end, at one point, in one context, I want to hear everything they've got to say. And that is, how do you deal with massive metadata? data sets or massive data sets, such as healthcare data, imaging data, all that, the provision of healthcare, diagnostics, radiology, cardiology. All of that, I think they will have a much better view as to what technology can do in speeding up analyzing that stuff. When it comes to drug discovery, biology.\n\n00:45:50,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think they should really leave that particular conversation to folks who have at least a close relationship with the conduct of these things, chemistry, et cetera.\n\n00:46:01,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n In this particular case, I mean, the general AI fun. Um took everybody up so recursion was up— even even though AI you know it's been part of their business and and nothing new in this uh uh announcements and the 500 billion dollar etc it's going to make a difference to them as far as I understand but in terms of Moderna being up one of the things that I was watching was of course the stock had been hammered uh post the 14 January the opening of JPM they downgraded guidance for 2024 downgraded guidance for 2025 stock got hammered etc. And then, of course, it started picking up again. First was the bird flu issue, unfortunate death of an individual, and now possibly a second one. And then, of course, came along all the talk about AI. And then the specific comment about mRNA vaccines.","char_start":42276,"char_end":46582,"start_time":"00:42:51","end_time":null}

And then the specific comment about mRNA vaccines.\n\n00:46:57,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Now, Larry Ellison didn't mention Moderna specifically. And then I'm watching Moreno's share price being up something in the region of 40, 20, 25% from that low. And yesterday was up another 8, 10%. Um, and then I'm looking at biotech, which has also an mRNA vaccine for cancer, also using AI or machine learning, let's call it that, to identify the new antigens that they need. In designing these mRNA vaccines, and that stock's only up 8%. So that got me really confused about what's going on, which of course is to do with BioNTech. If I may say, it's my personal opinion, are not as good as Moderna in terms of putting their story out. And it's a EU company as opposed to a US company. Nevertheless, that particular comment floated both boats, one more than the other. and now we're going to see how they're going to be able to execute at the end of the day, makes no difference to the data readout.\n\n00:47:55,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n When the data reads out, we'll see whether an mRNA vaccine can genuinely help in increasing the response rate to a survival or progression-free survival to a checkpoint inhibitor, which is what both companies are testing.\n\n00:48:09,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and I did look at it as a Europe versus U. S. response in that the focus on trying to lift U. S. sector companies and the tech biotech sectors here explained it a little bit. That Moderna may be more of the beneficiary. But it's interesting, there was another article by George Yancopoulos from Regeneron. Again, just throwing a little bit of shade again on AI and just that he admits that they use it as a tool, but he doesn't like the term AI. He says it's not intelligent. He prefers machine learning. And he says it can help with pattern recognition but that, you know, really, I think he's making a case that you need the right experience and contextualization of these data outputs. And, you know, it's not going to replace good drug developers, as he's proven to be at Regeneron. Similar to Daphne Zoller of In-Citro, was also trying to bring some sober-minded views on what questions can we answer.\n\n00:49:15,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n With AI and what are the limitations? So, you know, I think it's good that our industry is responding to some of this. You know, you know, cancer moonshot-type discussions, you know, discussion and rhetoric with kind of a bit of reality around it. So I'd encourage people to check out that. Uh, interview or uh, article about from Georgia Yancopolis, but uh, Lubia there was another news and NVIDIA really made a splash with their uh, uh investment in in AI. Uh, but what tells us about agentic AI?\n\n00:49:48,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, sure. Absolutely. And just one more comment on AI. I wish and I hope that, over the next few years, and I think this is where we'll get to. Is that we'll stop talking about the definition of what AI can do, what it cannot do, that we're better than AI. I'm not trying to say AI can do everything, but it's like back in the day when we talked about websites.\n\n00:50:10,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n Can you sell through a website or can you sell directly? Or when we started talking about digital health and there were panels and panels and. Lots of people were writing in McKinsey. People would hire McKinsey to define what digital health is, and now it's just there. It's, hey, you know, medical records are digitized, and now we have access to it, and we can gain insights from digitization of medical records. And not just insights, but it's just part of the workflow. In the healthcare space. We are still a little behind the ball here in the biotech space where we continuously talk about AI, which we should just accept that it's there. Agentic AI is a good example of that too.","char_start":46282,"char_end":50333,"start_time":"00:46:57","end_time":null}

Agentic AI is a good example of that too.\n\n00:50:52,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n NVIDIA did in fact make a big splash about their collaboration with Illumina that they announced at JPM. They've also been working with NVIDIA as well. And it's already, agentic AI is something that's already been embraced by many other industries. It is coming to biotech and life sciences. So I think everybody has to read up on it. It's already here. Um, it's, uh, and finally, you know, in healthcare, if you think about it, we generate a lot more information than any other industry in the world. In fact, 30% of world's data volume comes from biotech, life sciences, and healthcare. So we should be not just embracing it, but being up to speed in what it is. So, what is agentic AI? AI agents, just for those that don't know, are these systems that help you and I and everyone make autonomous decisions. If you look into, there's a recent McKinsey report, a talk projected that 40% of workforce will be automated over the next 20 years. and it will start with the use of agents and agentic AI.\n\n00:51:56,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n We did have AI assistance, just to make it clear this is not what we're talking about. They couldn't act on their own; we're talking about autonomous decision making. They make their own decisions. They're not just creating content for you, such as LLMs—uh, that you sift through and spend hours and hours and hours—um, so this is the year where we'll start creating agents that are specialized um in tasks that are relevant for drug discovery. Of course, there are companies that are already doing that. They just didn't call it agentic AI, but they have been creating agents. To do so. There's a great article if you want to learn about the use of agentic AI and how it will change work. and our processes, and HBR most recently. Also talks about its use in the healthcare setting.\n\n00:52:43,189 [SPEAKER_1]\n And NVIDIA, as I mentioned, JP Morgan did announce that they will be providing AI agents. So it's not something that you have to do as part of your own company. Although if you can, that will. that will actually differentiate you and create your own IP.\n\n00:52:57,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n And they're creating AI agents for accelerating R&D. They're also doing that to help commercialize drugs, which is probably going to be the first use of agentic AI in the life sciences most generally. Um, and it's also helping with NVIDIA, the NVIDIA and the QVIA collaboration is really going to be using the novel new agentic AI workflow to accelerate development and clinical trials. And, you know, NVIDIA's CEO actually has, when he was talking in JPM, already talked about, and actually he was talking about this in Japan. has given some examples of where AI agents are used today. So as an example, they serve as research and lab assistants. They optimize manufacturing supply chains already. They're executing on marketing campaigns. So it's already happening and there's going to be a lot more of it. And I'm actually on a part of the. Bio planning committee and have asked that we should really start talking a lot more about that and how we're going to use autonomous agents.\n\n00:54:00,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n To optimize our workflow in R &D.\n\n00:54:04,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, that's a great overview. And yeah, I agree. We use, we change terminology and. I mean, whether it was when we talked about big data or bioinformatics, and ultimately we have better and better tools and more computational power. To drive efficiency and activity. But it'll be interesting. It's moving so fast of how. Like the regulatory constraints, you know, stay on top of it.\n\n00:54:29,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n There's talk of supporting where AI can make the diagnosis or even prescribe things for patients. And when you start to take out that human choice and decision, even if AI is better, where's the accountability, where's the liability? Wow, it's cool to watch it in the early innings, but I think many want to make sure that we put the right guardrails and safeguards around that.","char_start":50033,"char_end":54343,"start_time":"00:50:52","end_time":null}

Sorry, I can't help myself. One of the things, Luba, that I think the world needs to do is to stop creating these random words.\n\n00:55:06,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Agent. Why agent? Tokens. Why tokens when it comes to LLMs and how they function? I mean, I know they're computer scientists and they have their own verbology or whatever you want to call it. But in order for people to understand better, if you just call it a lab assistant or automated lab assistant or, you know. That's much easier, right?\n\n00:55:28,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't know. I mean, honestly, if you look, I think we create a lot more complicated terms than they do in tech. I mean, Target, really? What? Come on.\n\n00:55:37,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's the show.\n\n00:55:38,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Because I can tell you, I have been at the forefront of actually teaching these agents our terminology and they're extraordinarily confused because we come up with a lot more terms. So I wouldn't be pointing fingers. You can ask, you know, I'll create an agent for you. You can ask the agent. I'll show you.\n\n00:55:57,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n and I I there is an element of marketing to this right so when you when you come up with a new term you have to define it and all of a sudden you can rephrase and reframe. exactly what we're talking about, because if you use old terms, they're going to be like, well, I know what that is and I know how that works. And so I think there is an element of creating new terminology so that people can take a fresh look and open-mindedness around adoption and that could be good or bad it could be used for ill as much as it is used for good, but point well taken, Sam. All right. So there was some other news on the Biogen front. Brian, you want to? cover this and Chris Viebacher's probably communicated a lot since he's been on board. They've made a lot of decisions, but what's the latest coming out of Biogen?\n\n00:56:41,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, it's funny with all the all the talk of sort of cancer vaccines and moonshots and grandiose statements underpinning the complexity of moving from bench to the bedside. Biogen announced strategic shifts around the research organization, which is actually a first effort by their transitioning CFO, who's replacing Mike McDonald. But it is a reflection of Chris's multi-year change at Biogen. Not the. Point out my age, but 10 years ago, everyone on Wall Street felt this had the most attractive pipeline and research organization and all of large cap. So you know, it's been quite a quite a change over the last decade. It sounds like there's going to be staffing cuts. They haven't specifically broken out how many, but the statement they are saying is that they're focusing on a new footprint that will match the needs of a prioritized preclinical portfolio. It does seem to come with a greater emphasis on external innovation. And look, I think this is something that CEO Chris Abakar has really emphasized, but I wouldn't say totally, but clearly has shown more favoritism towards sort of M&A and external innovations or the classical.\n\n00:57:46,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n Biogen, a massive investment in preclinical research.\n\n00:57:51,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's probably a reflection of a number of the pipeline failures that they had, which had really great pre-clinical research behind it and just never materialized in the same sort of clinical efficacy that pre-clinical models will. Wanting and I think it also underpins some of the the struggles that the company has, which is really to kind of generate um a replacement for for the melting ice cube that is their most successful franchise. Um, as you know, that sort of matured and they really haven't found a near-term sales line that has totally been able to displace that yet.","char_start":54043,"char_end":58180,"start_time":"00:54:55","end_time":null}

We see this trend a little bit varies company to company, but you know, are you better off cutting internal R&D? Drive more you know earnings and stock price, stock currency, and cash so that you can use that cash and stock currency to go and acquire products that are de-risked to feed the pipeline and and you know each company has a different level of spend that they want and target for R&D but sometimes this is a culling of. Inefficiency internally or an acknowledgment that it's not that easy to do. Internal R &D and outsourcing that to biotech. I kind of see this as. A little bit of a signal on that. And I think Wiebacher said this is the day job is to look for deals. And so it's almost like secondary, the internal R &D to supplement that. It'll be interesting to watch over the next couple of years.\n\n00:59:22,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, do you want to close this out with this Nature paper on GLP-1?\n\n00:59:26,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I can do it really fast, Chris. Nature Medicine, published online 20th of January.\n\n00:59:32,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n Mapping the effectiveness and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Remember those? Our favorite drugs currently in the obesity space.\n\n00:59:43,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n Summary, 40 positive events, i. e., things like Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, reduced suicidal ideation. Remember that?

But 40 versus 18, I think I'll take that. And I think that's, is it simply through the impact on reducing weight or is it also something to do with GLP-1 agonism?

But it's one of those stories where it was like all off the record and, you know, his people wouldn't confirm or anything. So, you know, it may or may not be rumors, but I'll just kind of go, I'll leave it open. And if anyone wants to jump in and chime in positive or negative without getting too political about things they've heard over the last couple of days. Go for it.\n\n00:01:51,030 [SPEAKER_4]\n I'll take a shot at it, Brad. I think, from where investors sit right now, we're all kind of um honestly sitting on our hands and waiting for some sign or direction around whether this administration is going to be. Pro-pharma or anti-pharma may be the most positive thing we've heard in terms of the potential pro-pharma direction.\n\n00:02:12,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n comes from the CEOs who have gone down to Mar-a-Lago and met with Trump and have come back and said, 'Don't worry, he's pro-business.' But I have to say, for those of us who are listening into the RFK Jr. hearings this week, RFK Jr. hearings this week. I mean, I was only hearing negative signs and you already alluded to this. I was hearing that he is going to put some teeth back into the IRA or maybe add teeth to the IRA.\n\n00:02:39,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n Disturbed about the disconnect in pricing, drug pricing between what goes over in the US versus Europe. Um and that you know, maybe even these Martian rights could come into play, which would be really tremendously negative for the group. So I don't know. I'm a little bit more nervous. Generally speaking, I don't have a lot of confidence that RFK Jr. and Trump, or this administration, is really speaking with one voice at this stage. But to put someone like RFK into this position, I think we're only doubling up on the potential unpredictability of what we might be hearing going forward.\n\n00:03:16,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just this morning on his Truth Social account, President Trump tweeted in all caps, 'America first' drug prices.\n\n00:03:25,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n With three exclamation points, um, you know that was something that he floated during his first administration and, given his whole, you know, mentality of tariffs and competition and, you know, countries are ripping us off, so to speak. It sounds like that's going to be front and center of drug pricing policy going forward for sure.\n\n00:03:49,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n Brad, there was a comment somewhere. I mean, it's been a bit of a whirlwind trying to keep up with everything that's been.\n\n00:03:56,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n It tweeted, and press released, and and confirmation hearing, etc. Um, that that there was uh again the um, I think maybe it was RFK Jr. himself who mentioned it in his uh hearing that that we might go back to the idea of looking at setting prices relative to other countries.\n\n00:04:20,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n I heard that somewhere. I'm not quite sure where it came from. But in general, our feeling is that he wouldn't be there if there wasn't. At least 50 votes in his favor.","char_start":0,"char_end":4260,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

At least 50 votes in his favor.\n\n00:04:33,979 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the hearing was, you know, it tried to expose all the variety of things that people thought he was for and against, etc. Course, the biggest focal point is vaccines. And he said repeatedly, 'I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm pro-science,' which, of course, is a great thing if that turns out to be exactly the case. What happens afterwards, of course, it's anyone's guess— in terms of there are many ways of being anti-vaccine. Without saying it, and that could be either changing the ICP, the vaccine injury compensation program, so that such that vaccine makers become open to uh uh to being sued, or changing the composition of ACIP. I mean, you know, one of the— if I'm not wrong—I think um, off it is, um, one of the members of ACIP. I might be confused here with the FDA verb pack. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. But if you can change that composition of the ACIP and all the rules and all the rules for the ICP, that obviously creates an opportunity for uh or a reason for vaccine makers to go well.\n\n00:05:48,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n Actually, we don't want to play here, and I don't know if there's a coincidence here or not. We just heard that Astrazeneca's can building. It's a UK plant for a vaccine that it was planning to vaccine plant. Of course, if you're a vaccine maker, wherever you are, one of your biggest markets would be the US. If you're open to being sued for random science that suggests that there is a risk that you cause the problem, then why would you be in that game?\n\n00:06:20,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'll add to this conversation first. I think Eric was spot on in that. The more concerning and most important things are. How they deal with IRA and margin rates. Right. I think. I didn't watch every minute of the hearings, but enough to say that this is theater.\n\n00:06:39,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n And you can usually track the lobbying interests and the kind of grandstanding from the senators. Getting their sound bites in. What's disappointing about it is that there was very little about how he would govern in the role and how right—uh—he— he thinks about the FDA or NIH or right— you know—uh—policy. I mean there's enough out there that you know he's he's put out, but you know I and this isn't just RFK hearing but all of them is just you know less about how would you govern moving forward and more about brokering past comments and statements, etc. Um, which you know, I think it lends itself to good theater. Um, I think you know, Brad, you tried to engage, I think, in a very um, objective manner online, and you know, it just it it disappointed me in terms of some of the responses on yours, but we do, you know, we don't we shouldn't be tone deaf. Okay, we have to realize that uh, there are a lot of people we've lost, a lot of trust, right?\n\n00:07:44,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n As an industry and as, quote, leading voices of pro-science. You know, that people pay attention to this stuff. And I think we've lost a lot of ground. A lot of this was during the COVID years, but uh, I think we need to figure out how do we get back and restore that trust. So I'll throw a contrarian view and I don't know, RFK will get approved or not and confirmed. You know. I think if he doesn't. I think we still have issues with convincing the public to trust the authoritative voices for our industry. And. And the contrarian view is man— if he does get in. Right? Uh, you know, we don't know what he's gonna do, and it could be damaging. But I can tell you know, half the population— or whatever percent you want to add to it— is now going to have no excuse. You know, and look, I think bad, uh, actions, right? Uh, will be revealed.","char_start":3962,"char_end":7934,"start_time":"00:04:20","end_time":null}

Uh, will be revealed.\n\n00:08:45,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think you know, there are other, not just RFK, but there are those who have MD and PhD credentials that a lot of the country is following, whether we agree with it or not, you know, we are part of the industry. So when Jay Bhattacharya has more followers than Eric Topol, or, you know, you have people like Peter McCullough or Robert Maloney, who have over a million followers and engagement. And we can say, well, they're not smart. It doesn't matter. You know, we're the ones who are the experts. You know, you're losing a sense of the zeitgeist out there. And so I think how do we restore trust? And part of that comes with. A focus on transparency now. You know, do we trust the VAERS system? Right. You know, as a population, do we? And so, I think there are some benefits that could come out of—restoring, you know, half the population to believe, in medicines and vaccines, or what have you, because I think we're losing that. You know, that battle. And I think, uh, it might only be made worse, right?\n\n00:09:48,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n Because of the types of hearings and, you know, grandstanding that we see. And Cassidy is a good example. Cassidy is supposedly the linchpin. On confirmation or not.\n\n00:09:59,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Out of the committee. You know, I went to his website because I don't know anything about him. I knew he was a Republican and, wow, he had this huge initiative to focus on hepatitis B vaccines. And so, I'm like, well, where did that come from? Because he had this exchange with Rand Paul. Uh, you know, who made a case why hepatitis B and so it just shows that there are conflicts of interest throughout. And I think the exchange with Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and seeing how much money they're getting from the lobbying efforts. You know, I think for the outside person looking in, they're going to view all of this as corrupt, and they're going to side with those who are going, quote, against establishment. And it's something we have to be realistic about and not just throw mud at anybody we disagree with. So that's a perspective as I think about this longer term.\n\n00:10:49,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n Chris, I have a question for you because I feel like when I'm hearing what you're saying, which is super interesting.\n\n00:10:55,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is your— I mean, this is maybe this is a dark look at it, but is the underlying thought here that if RFK Jr. does get confirmed and some of the dangerous stuff he's saying does permeate throughout the United States via vaccine hesitancy or things like that, that. That almost could ultimately be a catalyst to actually restoring public trust into some of the experts who maybe right now are being rejected for having these kind of old-school establishment conventional views.\n\n00:11:24,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I hope, no, I'm not suggesting that that is what I think is good or what I want.\n\n00:11:28,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n But it could, right? I mean, I'm not saying that that's like the right solution, but it might ultimately be how it plays out.\n\n00:11:34,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no, what I'm saying is that if he puts some things into place. That his constituents right—I've never heard people get cheered the way he got cheered in the gallery for what it's worth, but I'm the thing is his constituents, who if he says, 'Hey, we're to clean up the VAERS system,' right? We're going to do prospective studies that look at the entire childhood vaccine schedule with a modified child vaccine schedule versus no vaccine. Whether it's Amish or whatever that people cite for differences, if you start to employ some of this for true, let's get the data and let's get transparency.","char_start":7634,"char_end":11617,"start_time":"00:08:45","end_time":null}

Whether it's Amish or whatever that people cite for differences, if you start to employ some of this for true, let's get the data and let's get transparency.\n\n00:12:13,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n And again, I'm not saying we want health crises and I know that's the fear that we all have. But I'm saying that there is a pathway that— you know, being you know pro-business, there's the idea that you know, using IRA as an example, that you know, this could result in, quote, better negotiations for industry. And so I just, you know, I worry about the black and white nature, right? Uh, that we put all of these things in, and I think the confirmation hearings, you know, are designed to do that kind of, you know, black and white scenario. And so normally, what I see, you know, and again, we've had Trump, and we can all argue, you know, we had him for four years, and, you know, I think he, you know, is, you know, I think he's more of a pragmatist, right?\n\n00:12:57,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, and and I think he wants to modulate, and I think this is why so many people it's a revolving door, because you know, he he doesn't like the extreme ends of things, and he'll quickly remove someone if it becomes something that gets into the way of you know his various right constituents, so I don't know. Again, all I'm saying is a different countering countervailing voice. To say yes, we all know what the worst case scenario could be. But are we looking at what could be a modulated right benefit? Of. you know, everybody out there who who hates government hates the Fauci's and the Francis Collins's and right. The Peter Hotez is out there. Like all of those people, if RFK is actually in charge, what are they going to say then? Okay.\n\n00:13:49,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, so that's all I'm saying is that if he's not in, then I don't think we fixed anything right with public perception and. Right. You know, a change in embracing the institutions that we all hold in high esteem. So anyway, again, just a countervailing view. I'm still working out, kind of, you know, what is the right pathway here, you know. But um, I just I always feel that that we we are in a bubble sometimes, and we don't kind of look to the outside of. You know, what other MDs and PhDs, right, have countervailing views, the Vinay Prasads of the world, whatever you think of him, people are listening to him and they're you know really kind of deconstructing what he's saying and juxtaposing it and making up their own minds. That you know can be a good thing, it could be a bad thing.\n\n00:14:34,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n So for what it's worth, Chris, sorry, Brad. One of the things that could happen in the near term that wouldn't be negative, of course, is the parity for the IRA negotiations between small molecules and large molecules. Um, What does anyone believe the probability of that is? Even whether it applies to the list that's just been published or not, retroactive or forward-looking, does anyone have a view as to what the probability of that is?\n\n00:15:13,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, look for IRA, just retrospectively, we've seen that there are some that say, well, the additional haircut, right? The additional trim off of the already discounted CMS prices wasn't as bad as we thought. And I don't think people are thinking Trump's going to make it worse. We all know rhetoric has happened on both sides, Democrat and Republicans, right? Uh, for decades, right? And what ultimately comes out as more moderated. So I don't know. I think it's going to be the same? Is it going to be better? Is it going to be worse? You know, I really wish we would focus on while there is a unified, you know, Congress. That pro-business of getting what needs to be fixed about IRA and you know, throw out we need to throw out, modify what we need to modify. But I think there's an opportunity here and I haven't heard. You know, RFK, definitely not McCary or anybody who wants to throw out the idea of.\n\n00:16:15,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, drug development and, you know, let's do good. You know, safety efficacy studies and let's get drugs to patients that need it. So I think that there is a. A general Vaccines aside, um Let's make it easier for drugs to move forward.

So I don't know. That's an optimistic view on it.\n\n00:16:36,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n I was thinking more of the nine years versus 13 years. Well, that's what I'm saying.\n\n00:16:41,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n That should be an easy fix right now. I don't know why that would not be adjusted with this administration and this Congress. But I'm open to others who've thought about this more.\n\n00:16:53,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, so long as it's fixed in the right direction, right? With the small molecules going to 13, not vice versa. Amen.\n\n00:17:01,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, I'll close things out by saying my take is: you have to be pragmatic. And I think he's going to be approved. I didn't see anything over the last couple of days. I mean, there were a couple exchanges here or there, but like.\n\n00:17:16,369 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't think the hearing went off the rails, which is what I think it would have taken for him to not get confirmed. And so, as business people, I think we have to deal with that. And Chris, you mentioned my tweet since it did.\n\n00:17:30,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n Bring up, you know, so many comments and emotions on both sides, you know. I sometimes it's— You know, and people read into tweets. I'll just clarify exactly what I was saying, which is whether I agree with him or not on everything or anything.\n\n00:17:49,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n I actually think more than any other. of the nominees that he deserves to get confirmed and the reason is like people voted for him— not everybody, but a lot of people voted for him. Whereas, like, all these other nominees, I don't think most people, like, I didn't even know who Kash Patel was until today. Whereas, you know, this was a very high-profile thing. And I think part of what got Trump elected was that people do feel our country is.\n\n00:18:24,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, one of the most unhealthy countries in the world, in contrast to us being the richest nation in the world. And they feel that, whether you agree with him on every issue or not, that he's somebody who can shake that up and maybe change the status quo. And so for that reason. I think, if you look at it, not from a biotech perspective, but from like a politician's perspective, that it's in part, like, the will of the American people. So I think that, as business people, if it happens, we just have to make the best of it.\n\n00:19:01,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n and I'm guessing that it will, but let's move on because we have a lot of biotech news and I'll start with um, you know what— may have been a historic approval yesterday. So Vertex announces the approval of Jurnavix. I keep wanting to say Jurnvax, like it's a vaccine, but this is the Nav 1. 8. You know, it's the first approval. So it's approved for adults with moderate to severe acute pain. And Paul, I'll kick this one over to you. What do you think is the historical importance of this? For the field of pain, obviously, we've gone through the opioid crisis and Vertex specifically. And I know for investors, there's a little skepticism that this is a truly efficacious pain medicine compared to some other things that are available, what's your take on all of that?\n\n00:20:03,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks, Brad. I mean, I think that there's a drug development, scientific public health angle that is unequivocally positive. And then, as you alluded to, there's a stock angle that is much more nuanced. On the, I mean, on the drug development side, right? I mean, I think if you just take a step back, it's a really, really high hurdle for something like pain or mood or anxiety to have any drug where you can kind of decouple addictiveness or likeness from efficacy, right? I mean, to make someone who psychologically or neurologically feels bad feel better, but do that in a way that doesn't actually make the drug addictive. I mean, that's a really, really challenging problem.","char_start":15444,"char_end":19545,"start_time":"00:16:36","end_time":null}

I mean, that's a really, really challenging problem.\n\n00:20:41,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think that this drug, right— essentially working more on the peripheral nervous system on pain transmission and not neurologically on the awareness of pain, like an opioid, right?— a tremendous public health advancement. And I think there's some controversy, as you said, about whether this works as well as an opioid or not? I mean, look, the drug beat placebo in a number of studies. I mean, beating placebo in any neuroscience study is not a trivial feat. And so I think it's a really important drug and it could end up being a big blockbuster drug. And there's a number of other companies in the space that we and others are watching that are developing other NAV 1. 8s or NAV 1. 7s.\n\n00:21:22,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n Historically, for Vertex's stock, investors have been much more confident in the commercial prospects of the Vertex Paying portfolio in the chronic space. And that's more of like a health insurance dynamic, right? Because in chronic pain, I mean, notwithstanding the issue where chronic opioids are just tremendously unappealing and you know, almost unethical to prescribe, I mean, chronic, you can kind of think of a scenario where you're dealing with your typical commercial payers or Medicaid, and maybe you have to step through another drug. Lyrica or something like that, but many patients fail those drugs. And you know, with chronic treatment, a pricing of over $10, 000 a year— i mean, it's it's very very easy to model a multi-billion. I mean, if you go crazy, $5 to $10 billion opportunity there, right? Even if the drug doesn't work amazingly well, right? Because many of the other options don't work that well.\n\n00:22:15,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Launch, this is one of, I feel like, the rare instances where an approval like this, as you said, is so tremendous from a scientific perspective. And yet, if Vertex beat consensus this year, I think that would be a big win for the stock. Because I think people that I talk to, I almost have no idea how to model this. Because if you look at consensus at the pricing that they put out, it requires around 300,000 patients to be treated this year. Depending on how you want to kind of model the duration of treatment, right? You could say that that is an extraordinary amount and so many and oh my God, or you could say that's actually small penetration in this market.\n\n00:22:56,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n And others who've done this longer than me know, but just in my experience, acute care launches for non-life-saving treatments, they tend not to go well. curve is so slow. And so I think it's really, really interesting, right? I mean, I think for Vertex, they just came off a setback for their sciatica study, right, which has also made the kind of debate about this mechanism in the space a little bit more heated, although I don't think there's any reason to throw in the towel on other indications necessarily. But in acute, I would almost say when investors ask me, there's almost no consensus in terms of a true number. And I think for a win for Vertex would be really exiting this year, exiting this year in a position where this really is truly part of the treatment paradigm and broadly reimbursed, right? And that also— and I think that just tells you how hard it is to to sell in in this setting. So I'll leave it with that. If others want to kind of chime in, but um, yeah, ultimately, it's it's it's amazing from a scientific and medical perspective.\n\n00:23:59,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Anyone else on this one?\n\n00:24:03,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Nope. All right. Let's go.\n\n00:24:06,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n This is like a unicorn day. We actually have IPOs in biotech and it seems so far that at least the indications are looking very strong on them. Eric? Uh, you're a banker. Um, tell us about— or you're at least on the sell side of a bank. Um, tell us.\n\n00:24:25,259 [SPEAKER_3]\n What your thoughts are on, is the IPO market heating up or are these just like one-offs that are?

I certainly hope I'm not viewed as a banker. Not yet, at least. I haven't worn that cap in my career.\n\n00:24:49,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n We are at Cantor involved in a couple of these IPOs. In fact, I can't speak specifically to Metcera. That's one we were involved with. For that matter, I don't cover any of the stocks that we're going to be talking about today. But I guess the one thing here is that at one point it seemed like we were going to get a deluge of IPOs in early 2025. We had counted about 15 companies that were privately waiting in the wings, likely on file confidentially. and ready to go in Q1. But clearly, the markets have not cooperated. This week, you mentioned one name. We also had May's price last night. The first two IPOs of the year are out there. and you know—I'm sure there are a few more that are waiting in the wings. I think there are four that have flipped their S-1s that are at least on file publicly now. So I think we'll get a few more dripping out.\n\n00:25:45,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think there are a few things to note here. Number one, these are generally high-quality companies, right? The VCs and banks are not dumb. They realize that if they're going to have more IPOs over the course of 2025, they better lead with their. Best offerings in a very choppy market. So I can assume that the banks have done their test— the waters meetings— and what we're seeing are some of the best breed companies coming out. I think, you know, from where we sit. We meet with plenty of other good private companies that are achieving meaningful milestones. So I do think the quality is there. But, you know, two where I would be worried is— is the market receptivity, putting aside the high flyer in obesity that you referenced coming out this morning. My guess is that these early IPOs will not be well received by investors. They're going to probably be. You know, heavily insider-led rounds that could change with with good initial receptivity to some of the better quality names. And Paul, I'd love to hear your views on this. But, you know, from where we sit, we're just not hearing from our clients that they are ready to embrace the IPO market that might be coming.\n\n00:26:53,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n Most are still licking their wounds; most have still had, you know, very poor performance over the last couple of months. There's a cohort of investors that just doesn't want to hear about an IPO roadshow anytime soon. That's more function of the markets again. The quality of what we're hearing. And three, in the third point, I just mentioned a reference to this IPO trend that we'll talk about. You know, almost surely there's still a lot of dual tracking going on of IPOs with private M&A discussions going on behind the scenes. It's notable that. A couple of the private companies that were acquired this month, IDRX and Scorpion, were likely acquired right out of the IPO queue. So while it's great for IDRX and Scorpion, that is a little bit problematic for investors who kind of feel like. some of the better private names are being picked off before. they have a chance to come to the market and be invested in. So I'll pause there and I'm sure Paul does have some views he wants to share.\n\n00:27:48,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks, Eric. I mean, just like you, right? I'm going to say this with the caveat that I'm not commenting on any of these specifically because we may be involved in one or two of them. So with that, I would just say, in terms of what I'm seeing from a risk-taking perspective, is a lot of hiding and a lot of defensive investing.","char_start":23315,"char_end":27240,"start_time":"00:24:25","end_time":null}

I mean, look at Vertex's stock after Sciatica failed, right? I mean, it went to 390 and now it's, you know, retraced almost all of what it lost, you know, and I think that, that. Is less about enthusiasm for pain and more about just kind of embracing the scarcity value of the company. The sort of rhetorical question of, 'Hey, what else do I own in large cap?' right? I mean, you know, there's another name I cover, Nurocrine, where you've seen this, you know, big retrace after a pipeline failure. because it's a high quality company. It's got another launch going on. It's profitable. And so, I mean, the way I would sort of say it in large cap and mid cap is it's like defensive investing. And for the smaller stuff that I cover that is more binary, I would say in a lot of those stocks, it's niche interest, where there's certain people that I know that really care about them. And there's many others that are just kind of not concerned—because to get paid on a catalyst, you know, you got to be right and lucky right now.\n\n00:29:08,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think that's the general feeling.\n\n00:29:13,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, I think you had a comment on Metzera.\n\n00:29:17,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n But now I was just going to talk about the, so look, it's in the obesity space.\n\n00:29:23,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Contrary to what we were talking just before we started, there isn't really a major shortage of obesity ways or ways to play obesity. You've got Novo Nordisk, obviously, and Lilly.\n\n00:29:33,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Then you know I'm not judging any of them. I'm not saying whether good or bad, but you have a list of Sky Altimune Vikings, Dylan structure, and then here comes Metzera. So what do they have that distinguishes them from the rest that allows them to go through this IPO? Which just to give you the stats: 275 million dollars raised.\n\n00:29:53,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n They sold in the end 15. 3 million shares instead of the original offering of 17. 2, which is is great because they got a higher price. They priced it at 18. And Bloomberg just reported that they're trading at $28. 80. What does that mean for them? Their market cap is, at that price, would be around $3 billion. Around, right? I haven't done the detailed maths. $3 billion. What about the range that I just gave you? Sky to?\n\n00:30:26,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n zealand zealand being at the top and sky is sitting there with a 53 million dollar enterprise value or 100 120 million dollar market cap and at the other end of it is zealand at 7 . 2 billion dollars, so it sits in the middle. It's got a decent broad offering of pretty much every hormone that's involved in control of uh appetite and and nutrition. And they've got an interesting asset. When we looked at it, we wrote on it when the first data came out. It looks very decent. It seems to to to um you know back to that game of 20, 22, 25 weight loss, which is not my favorite game to play, but let's just do what the world is hell-bent on doing. They seem to be better than Zedbound, which is currently the best drug that we have out there. And maybe on par with the triple G or the retratratide that Lilly is developing now. And that's saying something because it's just the GLP.

Well, I've scoured the S1 and I couldn't find any more detail. There was no detail at the time either. But that is not abnormal. Only last week we had Novo give us— I mean, creating safety and tolerated trial. And they just told us how much people lost weight, rather than to actually tell us what the detailed safety tolerated was. So all that will come out. I don't know whether they had it in their presentations. Nevertheless, it's a pretty healthy sign, which I'm really sad to hear. Both Paul and Eric, um, sitting being relatively um conservative in their thought process about going forward, but I mean, you know, and and um, we need we need successes like this because otherwise, what are you going to do with all those host of private companies? And when I get to talk about our little M&A analysis, I'll talk to you about the percentage of deals last year that were private versus public.\n\n00:32:33,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, one thing I'm watching— this is much earlier stage. I don't think it's baked too much into today's valuation, but. Towards the end of the last year, when I was visiting Korea, I visited The Metzera's Korean partner, D &D Pharmatech, that's trying to make their oral obesity medicines. And the angle is that they're focused on doing oral peptides. And I'm a big believer and a skeptic— I'm not sure that small molecules like GLPs are going to work out. I think it's going to take something like an oral peptide if we're going to have oral therapy.\n\n00:33:11,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n interesting thing to watch in their pipeline, but let's move on.\n\n00:33:17,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n And let's talk about data. We had some interesting data, in fact. One company I think had some really stellar data and was able to raise 400 million off of it. So this is the mash space, and I would say that you know the mash face in general is kind of pointed in a positive direction. The Madrigal launch seems to be going pretty well. Um, so this is a Caro, and they announced 96 weeks data for their FGF21. And this was in stage four fibrosis, which is basically cirrhosis. So Eric, I'll kick it over to you to tell us more about the data and the investor reaction.\n\n00:34:01,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I agree, Brad. This is a big deal for not just Acaro and not just 89Bio, that's also in this space. You know, more broadly, the industry this is what the industry really needs to see. Sure, it'd be great if we uh have some well-overprescribed IPOs that trade well. And Sam, I'm certainly optimistic that we will see that. But, you know, we.\n\n00:34:22,590 [SPEAKER_4]\n We are still snakebitten from the fall when we had some stocks trade really well in the first couple of weeks in the market, only to roll over. The Icaro data is a game changer, right? This is a really big indication. Brad just mentioned Nash Mash. Probably about 8 million US patients affected by this disease. We've had the magical launch for Restifra, which, just nine or so months in, is selling at well over a few hundred million dollars run rate. And this is also almost certainly a market that pharma is watching very closely because of the innovation and the size of the opportunity, and because pharma really doesn't have much going on here. Uh, just for those who don't know, in the Acaro trial, about 39 of patients treated with F-Rexifirmin experienced a reversal of cirrhosis after 96 weeks. That's about twice the level or more that experienced reversal on placebo.","char_start":30306,"char_end":34199,"start_time":"00:31:28","end_time":null}

That's about twice the level or more that experienced reversal on placebo.\n\n00:35:17,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n These are F4 patients, right? So they're very advanced in their stage of disease with fibrosis. On average, if you're an F4 NASH-MASH patient, you have a life expectancy only about five years. So the unmet medical need here is almost oncology-like. And also, very importantly, GLP-1s have not shown any fibrosis benefit in F4 patients. The data from Akiro slams the door uh closed on the view that know was circulating a little bit last year that the GLP-1s would somehow disintermediate or disrupt the NASH market, making these drugs obsolete. It goes without saying that when you have a drug that can reduce fibrosis, you can charge a premium pricing. And a lot of these patients, of course, are already diagnosed in the system under care. Yeah, Kiro and 89Bio, they're really the only two companies with an FGF21 agonist in phase three development. Pharma is behind here.\n\n00:36:17,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think Novo has a drug in phase two and Boston Pharma as well. But it's no surprise that Acura was up over 100% this week. That's great for biotech investing. That's exactly what we want to see, people who are already publicly traded, making good gains on great data. And even 89Bio was up about 35% in sympathy. So, you know, nice reactions, nice fundraising from both. Just great to see good fundamental news flow being rewarded. Chris, I know you probably have some thoughts on this as well.\n\n00:36:50,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, no, I just, I really also really like how the Nash smash space has evolved. I just remember more than a decade ago when the intercept data, and went to $10 billion with Mark Brzezinski, and really because everybody knew it was such an unmet need. And we've just seen flow incremental. So this was a nice milestone. And the other thing is, is that You know, the CEO of Akiro, first, I encourage everybody to watch the Brad Loncar Biotech TV. You know, Brad, you're really showing that you can get real time. Interviews on video with CEOs that are in the news. So that was cool. But Andrew Chang is somebody I met 25 years ago at Gilead. And back then I saw him as one of the best. drug developers I came across. There was a lot of good clinical development leads at Gilead, but he really stood out. We did a lot in the liver space with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, really understood the gastroenterology community in that, and so was not surprised at all that Even though Akira did have some, you know, some challenges through development that I really felt that he would know how to navigate that.\n\n00:38:00,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n Was any failure with Akiro, it wouldn't be because of a lack of drug development expertise. So it was really nice to see a former colleague, Andrew Chang, find his success there.\n\n00:38:11,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I just point out: I know a lot of, especially public market investors, have been pretty depressed lately, but. This whole news item, the fact that they had good data and they raised $400 million off of it, I think is a sign of how biotech- is healthy for people who are succeeding. And let's remember a couple of years ago, there was actually a moment in time where, if you had good data like this, people used it as a liquidity event and got the heck out of there. And you weren't even guaranteed a stock pop, let alone the ability to raise up to like 400 million. So I think that, while things aren't like rock and roll right now, for cases like this where you have good data and good spaces like this, companies can succeed.\n\n00:38:59,759 [SPEAKER_2]\n Brad, can I just jump in one second? I think all around the room, I'm sorry I interrupted you. I think we should celebrate this particular thing. I know biotech's got its tough times, etc. But think about what we just talked about. Obesity.","char_start":33899,"char_end":37985,"start_time":"00:35:17","end_time":null}

Obesity.\n\n00:39:16,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n Was I mean most people would have laughed at me if you talked about obesity five years ago, MASH, NASH, NAFLD, whatever the names, it had, how many years have we been talking about it? And look where we are now today. And then of course, we just talked about pain. So many people died on that hill. And of course, it's still a very tough target area. So the interesting thing here is that we've got science and entrepreneurs just don't give up. And I think that is the whole point of biotech. And I think we should be celebrating that.\n\n00:39:51,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right, Chris, I'm going to go back to you.\n\n00:39:55,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sarepta had some. long-term follow-up data from the Embark study. So I think it's like up to two years. And importantly, we saw how the crossover patients did, right?\n\n00:40:06,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I look um so I i uh since I left Serepta, I watch very closely how they communicate data uh and you know I've been critical of them in the past in terms of how they you know uh selected data you know that even study designs and patient selection but I have to say with this one.\n\n00:40:25,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n uh It I think it does put an exclamation point on this you know uh elevitis uh data set uh to have a crossover where those patients who went on uh elevitis you know a year later because I mean one of the criticisms is the these kids are younger and they're still growing and you have to kind of caveat. some of the improvements because we see placebo. patients improve in that first year. But these kids were a year older. Uh, now you know— over seven— and so you start to have a more compelling case that any benefit improvement. You know, stabilization at these ages is a real drug effect.\n\n00:41:04,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, obviously, North Star, there's two components of the North Star: the time to rise of the, you know, kind of Gower's maneuver and the 10 meter run walk. And both of those, you know, they showed consistent data that they showed with the first cohort. And then they buttress that not just on the placebo comparison but also with— you know, external, you know, prospective cohort that's matched. Right. So, I mean, I think that, you know, that natural history comparison combined with the placebo combined with the crossover makes it compelling. Now, the stock really didn't move much. I think there was one report that said that the FDA database had a death. That might have blunted it. But they did have a strong quarter. And I just wonder that. Given this is gene therapy, you know, that you get a bolus of patience. I thought, you know, with the European approval on the horizon, it might show that hey they're going to continue to generate revenue over the next few years with this product. Uh, you know, but you know, it's hard to judge from the, you know, HCV curative to, you know, COVID vaccines to, you know, how much do investors.\n\n00:42:10,589 [SPEAKER_1]\n handicap that this is just going to be a bolus of cash over. a couple years in gene therapy and more of a trickle. with new incidence patients coming on. anyway, but I I thought the data was good and I think it addresses some of the questions around how real the drug effect is.\n\n00:42:28,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, in a way, it almost brings us back to our initial discussion on politics. There were a lot of, and still today are, a lot of FDA clinical trial purists who were not happy that this drug was approved to begin with. You know, remember it didn't hit its primary endpoint and it was a controversial approval. And got the review staff got overridden and all of that. And, you know, maybe data like this shows us that.\n\n00:42:57,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n It's not always black and white and that, you know, there are many variables that over time that, you know, bear looking at.","char_start":37685,"char_end":41834,"start_time":"00:38:59","end_time":null}

Sad news this week also. So Cargo Therapeutics, which is the car tea company, had a lead program that was a seed. B22 program. And for disclosure, I want to mention that Chris was an investor in the Series A, and so he can't comment on it. And so I'm going to kick it over to Eric to ask you, what was your reaction when you saw this news?\n\n00:43:41,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n I was surprised, Brad. And you're right. This was a really difficult development for the field of cell and gene therapy, which as a subsector is really in need of good news. It's really already from disappointment. I think if you had asked 10 people last week whether the cargo trial was going to work, probably eight or nine, including myself, would have said, 'yes, the phase one data were that compelling,' but You know, this is biotech and this week we found out that there are CAR T therapy, which is, as you mentioned, directed at CD 22 and was designed to work in patients who were already. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy failed. And it was a double whammy failure. It fell short on efficacy where durability response just not there, and on safety, where there was a high incidence of HLH, which is kind of an aside, a very serious side effect that we are seeing increasingly crop up in these. these CAR T-cell studies.\n\n00:44:36,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, maybe in retrospect, there were probably a few signs that we should have paid closer attention to. The phase one was a single-center phase one. They did change the manufacturing process between phase one and phase two. And they may have even kind of heavily selected the phase one patients, but that's all. Water under the bridge. Unfortunately, the company's had to lay off half of its employees. It's terminated the ferry sale program. And it's going to reinvest. It's remaining cash about 360.\n\n00:45:06,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n 60 plus odd million into its pipeline. I don't cover the stock, but I guess one question I have is whether it's even a good idea to redeploy that cash flow into a pipeline of even riskier stage. Uh, car t cell assets and brad and chris love your your views on this i mean The cash they raised was clearly earmarked for a fear of sell at the time when investors thought this was going to be a viable commercial product. I don't think anyone would have given them that money to invest in this riskier pre-proof of concept set of assets.\n\n00:45:37,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n I do think we have a bit of a real problem with management and boards just kind of rolling their capital. One failure into whatever is up next in their pipeline. This is not an efficient way to use. Uh, very precious cash reserves in in our industry. So I'll throw that out there: the team sees if now, yeah.\n\n00:45:55,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll just comment. I can't talk about what the company might do moving forward— they are on a lot of cash. I will say this: it's another former colleague of mine, more on the commercial side. Gina Chapman was at Gilead and I worked with 25 years ago. She went to Genentech after Gilead. But look, our bar has always been high for cancer therapies, for cell therapy, you know, just broadly as a VC firm, I would say perception. 'Broadly' sets a high bar. And we were compelled by the clinical data, but just shows you biotech is very humbling. I think there was some knock on calling it a great. five adverse event, which means a death and to not be just clearly transparent for those who might read about what is a grade five SAE.\n\n00:46:39,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, look, this was a real disappointment as an investor, where we had a lot of potential great researchers out of Stanford, you know, encouraging clinical data.\n\n00:46:49,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n Brad or others are welcome to comment.\n\n00:46:51,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, I'll actually jump in and take the other side of the argument on the early stage stuff. So I have to say, I haven't followed the story closely. I remember when it, I remember. The Series A and following that news. And I remember it IPO-ing about a year ago, which was very rare.

That was a very difficult moment in time.\n\n00:47:12,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Actually, the thing that stood out to me was um the later stage, um, program. So they have a, they have a multi-specific, um, in their pipeline that targets CD19, CD20, and CD22, and as, like, a biotech and science like enthusiasm, that actually stood out to me because, like, the way that I view the CAR T space is I always use an analogy. I always say, like, think of like CAR T today is like a Swiss army knife with one tool. You know, you can hit one antigen. Where with advances in engineering, the exciting thing is these CAR-T cells are now becoming like Swiss Army knives with multi-tools. And so to be able to engineer in multi antigens into one CAR T product, I think is really exciting. And complicated for sure and risky, but I think that's the future of where these types of technologies are going.\n\n00:48:13,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I think we'll look back on these. Today's version of Carti and these cells— you know, like the future being just so much smarter and dynamic than they are today. So, if it was up to me, which it's not, I would say go forward with the early stage program because I think it's emblematic of future technologies.\n\n00:48:33,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, so moving on.\n\n00:48:37,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, I'm going to kick it over to you.\n\n00:48:41,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n We'll talk about M &A broadly. I know there's a report that you want to talk about. And one thing that's been in the news—actually, the last couple of weeks— that may impact, may or may not impact M &A is a lot of companies like Merck, for example, have announced new rounds of very large buybacks. I think Merck's was like 10 billion. So tell us about those buybacks and whether that says or doesn't say anything about the, you know, what's out there to be purchased. And maybe they're just, you know, can't find anything and are spending the money on their own stock and just kind of the M&A space in general.\n\n00:49:27,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, the report that you have.\n\n00:49:30,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, sure, Brad. So the first reaction I had when I saw the Merck announcement, $10 billion, is, well, that doesn't sound great for the general capital allocation. Why wouldn't they be? And this is not exactly a. Secret that that Merck's got a big um, like they don't want to call it a patent cliff, they want to call it a hill. Fine, a a a patent hill to deal with, because it's going to be not as sharp as a small molecular generalization, obviously.\n\n00:50:02,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then you start scratching the surface and thinking about, okay, where are we at now? So Merck's been one of the most active in acquisitions already.\n\n00:50:10,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n At least our data suggests that. Both licensing and M &A. And then you think about the fact that these are companies with massive cash flow. So we have a system, a calculator, if you like, that our credit team runs, which works out. Debt capacity of any company that you want, based on the EV to net debt ratio that you're interested in.\n\n00:50:35,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Or debt to earnings ratio that you would put in there. And there's no question that Merck can continue to do M &A deals, not obviously of the 10, 15, 20 billion number, which I'm sure they can if they wanted to. But with cash for companies which, with, in, in the bolt-on range, which is what's been going on anyway, so that was my first reaction and then I thought, actually, let's just stop—not—not—not. You can't make this conclusion just based on the fact there's 10 billion buyback. And then talking about the kind of companies that they've been buying. I mean, our data, I'm not going to go through it all, given the time that we've got this. But the one last, one key point that I wanted to. to bring out is: first of all, and forgetting the licensing side, 80% of M &A deals are US domiciled. In the 2019 to 2024 range.","char_start":45679,"char_end":49855,"start_time":"00:47:12","end_time":null}

In the 2019 to 2024 range.\n\n00:51:27,519 [SPEAKER_2]\n And there was one China acquisition, and that was AstraZeneca's gray cell acquisition. So we took an M &A here. And that was the first time since 2019 to our data. So whatever's happening with licensing deals, it doesn't have any relationship to what's going on with M &A. But what was the interesting that stood out is that private companies were definitely more popular in 2024 versus the average over the 2019-24. Average over 2019-24 was just over half the deals. With large pharma focused only. I'm only looking at them as the acquirers. We're for private companies. Last year, according to our data, 68%. Now that doesn't really help our public investors, but it goes exactly down the road of what Eric was referring to in terms of some of these companies are coming along, looking at the IPO market and then get taken up such as Scorpion, et cetera. So that fits in pretty nicely.\n\n00:52:28,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll leave it there.\n\n00:52:32,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right. I'm actually going to move on in the interest of time. We've had a lot, especially with like the political discussion to pack into this. And I just want to mention, since we're talking about large pharma.\n\n00:52:44,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n One thing that was in the news: either yesterday or the day before I've lost track of time is that Takeda announced that Christoph Weber is going to retire in June of 2026. So it's still a little ways off. And he'll be replaced by Julie Kim, who's the the head of the U. S. operations right now. I just want to say I've interviewed Christoph a couple of times for Biotech TV— once at JPM a year ago and then most recently um in Tokyo at the headquarters there. I just want to say that, of people I've interviewed, my take on all of that is I think it's really underappreciated.\n\n00:53:32,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n How he's transformed that company, it hasn't quite shown up in their stock price right now. Um, but in general, you know, the Japanese companies are very inward and insular. And he took a company like that and truly transformed it into a global company. A statistic that people might not know is it's actually the biggest biotech, it's the biggest life sciences employer in Massachusetts. And if you've walked around Kendall Square, I'm sure you've seen the construction of the enormous new headquarters that they're building, kind of like great caddy quarter. An island's building and, Really, I think the vast majority of the R&D and innovation that is going on in Takeda is mostly happening there. And I think he's created a pretty solid foundation for future medicines.\n\n00:54:32,049 [SPEAKER_3]\n Anyway, I just wanted to say that because I think he's a good guy that's been doing good things.\n\n00:54:38,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then another thing that we had in the news, Chris.\n\n00:54:44,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm going to kick this over to you since you're our VC expert. So CurieBio had another huge fundraise that definitely made a splash in the VC world.\n\n00:54:55,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, look, real simple. Uh, VC funds are still uh able to close uh you know. This was not too long after they did their inaugural, you know, half a billion dollar fund. This is a smaller one, I think. One criticism I've had is that how are you going to deploy that many good seed investments? They closed a pro rata fund last year to continue to invest in those that they seed. But I interviewed Alexa Borsi recently on Bio Venture Voices, and yeah, he said, look, they're, they're, they're planning to do more and more of these seed rounds. Um and actively manage them, so you know, looking forward to seeing what they're doing. Then, uh, AVC, uh, did a filing suggesting that they want to, uh, aim for a, a billion dollar fund. So, just the idea that there's more private capital, a lot of dry powder, to continue to fuel investments. And then, just wanted to highlight, you know, 23andMe.","char_start":49555,"char_end":53769,"start_time":"00:51:27","end_time":null}

And then, just wanted to highlight, you know, 23andMe.\n\n00:55:46,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, they're running out of cash quickly. They announced a strategic sale. This has been a company that's really had a lot of issues, data breaches, board resignations. But really, for me, it highlights a lot of meta themes where, you know, data. I mean, you have a company that should have been, and could have been, at the forefront of generating genetic information from patients. The fact that they only got about 15 million genetic samples, to me, was surprising. How little reach they actually had, even though that is a pretty large database compared to other databases to look at genetic patterns and identify new targets. But also the idea that it's not easy to be multiple business models here. The consumerization got more commoditized. Uh, and here was a big brand with a lot of smart people and you know, big investment behind it that failed. And I think it speaks a lot to some of the business models in this arena and some of the challenges in an area that everybody probably would have guessed.\n\n00:56:49,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n Five, 10 years ago that would have been a big player. So I thought that was notable.\n\n00:56:55,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right. Well, we only have one or two minutes left and we didn't get to our entire checklist today. So I'm just going to go around and give everyone a chance to. Maybe make a closing statement. And if there's anything that we didn't get to that you'd really like to highlight, give you a chance to do that. So I'll start with Paul Matisse.\n\n00:57:18,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n Putting me in the spot, dude.\n\n00:57:22,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Nothing major. I think the only thing that I, you know, we were going to talk about was Sage, you know, essentially turning down this Biogen offer. And, you know, I was, I was turning over. That when Eric was talking about this idea of companies raising capital and things not going well, and then you know, using that capital for something else, and so you know, I'll just leave that. This is going to be a really interesting situation to watch kind of play out, right? I mean, Sage, I've talked to Barry, who I've known for a long time from Sage, and he certainly has ideas on how they can create value. Independently. And I respect Barry immensely. I also think there's an argument here that trying to get more out of this Biogen offer might be sort of the best path for everybody. And that'll be an interesting one that we're watching closely.\n\n00:58:06,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, remind me, do you cover Biogen?\n\n00:58:10,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n I do.\n\n00:58:10,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n Really quick question on that. You know, they were in the news about a week ago for I mean, I may have this wrong, but my quick. Skimming of the news seems to imply that they're basically not. They're cutting back on discovery work and they laid off a bunch of people.\n\n00:58:28,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n Is that a that is that a good thing? That they're going to focus on external innovation.\n\n00:58:36,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't know. I mean, I feel like that's like such a rabbit hole to go down in terms of, you know, how often do companies in the position of a Biogen, that's a low multiple stock, really create a lot of value in outperforming the market on business development. I mean, we all know that's a tough path, but. I mean, for Biogen, right, they really don't get any credit with their internal pipeline.\n\n00:58:58,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n If they did a buyback, they wouldn't get credit for that. I think people want them to do BD. So maybe I'll leave it at that. And by the way, they want them to do something that is considerably bolder than this Sage deal.\n\n00:59:11,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right, Eric, over to you for any closing statements.\n\n00:59:15,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, I mean, I feel like Paul and I could probably talk about Biogen's woes for a whole a whole hour session, but yeah, we've had a lot to cover already. Thanks for organizing this. Brad, we got a lot more going on probably through the weekend. So stay tuned. I'm sure there's going to be some some more headlines from biotech.\n\n00:59:35,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sam?\n\n00:59:38,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm all good, Brad.

You're listening to Biotech Hangout, a live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry with a group of biotech insiders. I'm Daphne Zohar, and my co-hosts today are Paul Matisse, Brian Scorny, Tim Oppler, and Abe Cisse. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent Tim, you mentioned that investor sentiment is improving. Is the market beginning to settle in with the new administration, including RFK, and some of the broader macro uncertainty around tariffs?\n\n00:00:37,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think so. So if you go back to the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference.\n\n00:00:43,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, we had a pretty good Monday, January the 13th. and the market went down so the XBI was like trading around 86 and a half. The XBI since then has traded up pretty nicely. So it hit a high of 94. 7. Today it's down a little bit, sort of around 92.\n\n00:01:03,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n So the market is up. and uh, you know, Paul and I, as he was saying, we're at this conference in Utah so we had a ton of investors so it's a nice opportunity to just to chat know with a variety of different types of hedge funds and long bonds and sort of see where you know, the mood is. And Paul, I'd love to hear what your impressions are, Brian, with, you know, what you're hearing in the market. But I would just say that things were less negative. I hesitate to use the phrase 'positive.' Things were like really negative at the start of January and that seems to be shifting.\n\n00:01:37,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I ask people like, why, you know, why do you feel better about the market?\n\n00:01:42,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n A lot of people talked about RFKs. confirmation hearing as being somewhat comforting. And also, I think Trump is now talking about. um, kind of pulling back a little bit on these tariffs. So it's more, I would say, carrying a big stick than actually, you know. using the stick. And I think there's also a sense that Trump is really committed to take interest rates down. So yesterday. He actually came out and said, I'd like to see the 10 year, actually not Trump, but the new treasury secretary said, I'd like to see the 10 year. treasury yield to come down. So that's obviously very good news for biotech.\n\n00:02:22,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n So less negative is the new positive.\n\n00:02:26,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, do you have any comments for Ryan?\n\n00:02:29,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I think. I don't know, maybe a little bit less negative. I still feel like in my coverage, and I bet Scorny could echo this, or maybe not. That there's more, there's more like defensive investing than um, then really wanting to take on risk. And some of these beaten-up, still super binary, high-science names, right? I mean, I feel like, if I'm taking, if I'm looking at the spectrum of you know beta or risk in my coverage, like there's still a lot of small companies that have interesting science, but are more speculative, where it's harder to generate a lot of interest, you know, and then I think just Thank you. You have this Nurocrine trade down today, which is a little bit tough. I think that was a name that was well-liked and maybe a little bit crowded, and might have some broader concerns on. On the payer Medicare side that people are talking about. But yeah, I mean, maybe it's not as bad as January, you know, it's not as better. And we've had some good news events too, and some successful financings on the back of those news events. So, probably improving, but still feels like it's, I don't know if, if you're indexing it to the past five years, below average, what do you think, Brian?\n\n00:03:31,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I kind of agree with that sentiment, too. I definitely think it's more of a less negative situation, but coming from a basis where I think, like, Tuesday of J. P. Morgan. when We're on our second day of consecutive 2. 5% down after some pretty sizable M &A. It was starting from a pretty negative base. So, you know, I get a sense. Investors are trying to keep their head down, trying to do a little bit more risk off.","char_start":0,"char_end":4124,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Investors are trying to keep their head down, trying to do a little bit more risk off.\n\n00:03:56,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Obviously, people still view catalysts as tradable events. There's definitely like the more defensive plays you see, you know, dividend-paying stocks, large caps are performing pretty well. And, you know, I mean, as much as we've been up since JPM, I mean, we're still, you know, trailing the S&P by twelve percent. So, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know that we're looking at a positive sentiment. Look, we've talked about this a ton of times. Um, But to Tim's point about the sort of de-escalation of tariffs on, at least from what Trump is saying, there's just this massive sensitivity to the sector of. Is there a chance the 10-year rate curve sees a steep incline in rates? And as we saw maybe 14 months ago, there was this huge tailwind from the idea that we were going to see the 10-year decline. So as much as that sort of macro trade is on, that seems to be a big sentiment driver for the market.\n\n00:05:02,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n So if I listen to you guys and sort of listen to myself, I would say that I'm saying sediments gone from like a two out of 10 to like a four out of 10. Paul, I think you're saying like two to maybe 2. 5. I don't know. And Brian, maybe a little better. Would you agree with that or am I just being delusional?\n\n00:05:22,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, no, I think that, I mean, I would say maybe from a one to a three is how I'm different.\n\n00:05:28,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. And one of the issues we have right now is that the lack of generalist interest. And I want to come back to a conversation I was having with Tim yesterday. Tim, you mentioned that you're seeing a re-emergence of wall cross pipes. And wall cross pipes were very much in vogue around a year ago. They concerned me at the time because they tend to preferentially advantage specialists. And last year, when we were seeing a bunch of these, I spoke to a couple of friends who are top-tier specialist investors in biotech. And one of them said, and one of them was actually on the show, I won't mention his name because he's a friend.\n\n00:06:04,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n One of them said, 'Hey, it's my job to outperform the market and I'll take any advantage I can over generalists.' Generalists aren't my problem. I don't have to look out for them. I have to. Do better than them. And another felt that these practices, like the wall cross pipes, were borderline unethical and that the SEC should look into them. But he also admitted that he's not going to turn down an opportunity to see the data and participate. My question is whether these inside baseball types of deals hurt generalists? Interest in the sector and over the long term may hurt the performance also of the specialists. I'd love to hear from you first, Tim, and then from the others.\n\n00:06:40,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean it's such an important question for our sector. I mean the reality is that a lot of companies are able to access capital. Because of specialist investors.\n\n00:06:49,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n And specialist investors say, 'Hey, we want to do it with a pipe with this discount or this particular twist or turn. You know. That's the price of doing business.\n\n00:06:59,950 [SPEAKER_4]\n At a macro perspective, I do think that.' You have to worry about how, know specialist tends to preference, and you know the reality is generalists are not participating as much as one would like in our sector.\n\n00:07:15,539 [SPEAKER_4]\n I personally. Thanks. That there are a set of relatively deep issues with how our sector works that are keeping generalists away. Not the least of which is, you know, AI looks pretty shiny and you don't have to have a PhD to buy video stock. But at some point, things are going to turn in our sector's direction. And I do think that we should think hard about this. This is practice.\n\n00:07:40,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n Does anybody else have comments on specifically wall cross pipes?\n\n00:07:44,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh, sorry, go ahead Tim. I think you cut out. I thought you were done.\n\n00:07:49,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n Oh, yeah, no, I was just saying that that's my view. And, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a feature of our sector, but also has its downsides.","char_start":3826,"char_end":8286,"start_time":"00:03:56","end_time":null}

And, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a feature of our sector, but also has its downsides.\n\n00:07:59,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I guess I would say, jumping in here, that I feel like generalists are so far from being involved in the type of stocks that are wall-crossed pipes, it's not even an issue right now, right? I totally agree.\n\n00:08:14,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Maybe you could get them into a Regeneron or an Amgen.\n\n00:08:20,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, getting them into like 2 billion or less market cap companies. I mean, we are so far away from grabbing their interest there, but I don't think it's dissuading them. At all.\n\n00:08:33,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n And what about other practices? Abe, it looks like you want to comment.\n\n00:08:37,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I was just going to comment, you know, as an operator and, you know, Daphne, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this too.\n\n00:08:45,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think in markets like we're operating in today and trying to raise capital, you know, I do believe that optionality is. is so important. So, although these wall cross pipes may somewhat divide or segment the types of investors that can be involved and will be involved, I think the reality of the situation is— for you know, uh— raising capital in this environment you have to preserve that optionality. Um, it's just— it's just kind of like the world we live in right now. So, um, it's not probably appealing to all investors, but I think, as an operator, you have to kind of, as I said, really preserve that optionality.\n\n00:09:34,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and I think the question is, what does it take to get generalists to come back into biotech, into the smaller biotechs, you know, the sub-2 billion companies? And it's such a complex set of— you know, first of all, data you have to really understand the data you have to understand the catalyst. And I think there's so much complexity in the industry that it seems like the decks are sort of stacked against any generalist investor. So I don't really know if I have an answer to that. I do agree with you that it's important to have options as an operator to be able to have options for how you fundraise. So I think this is more of a question more broadly about how do we get. generalists to come back into the sector. And obviously, M &A is one of those. And I'd love to actually go back again to Tim to talk about big pharma earnings and what they were saying about M &A.\n\n00:10:29,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and Daphne, before touching on that, you know I've often thought that There are just way too many companies that announced like a complete response letter. in phase three and like investors are all surprised. Thank you. And so biotech companies that are public are subject to all sorts of SEC disclosure requirements.\n\n00:10:49,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n That are probably not that relevant. To what investors actually care about.\n\n00:10:55,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know. So many companies, when you go in and you do your M &A diligence, you discover that there's something pretty unpleasant that got said to them by the FDA. And correspondents that they're just not disclosing to investors so the quality of disclosure about what really matters— how are you doing that data? How's your science and how are you doing with the FDA? Quoted disclosure is actually not that good in our sector. And if there's one thing that I think. Could improve.\n\n00:11:25,270 [SPEAKER_4]\n Generalist access would be to take away some of the edge. That specialists have in the specialist edges, figuring out what's actually going on, get on the phone and do doctor calls, you know, go sniff around. On clinical sites and find out if the company is telling the truth or not.\n\n00:11:41,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, that's great if you're a hedge fund. I do think it tends to work against the overall story in the sector. I don't know if others share that view.\n\n00:11:50,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n But the quality of disclosure, I think, could be better.","char_start":7986,"char_end":12181,"start_time":"00:07:44","end_time":null}

Like I think I've had some interesting conversations with this about just regulating the sector and regulating management commentary in the sector. And I think the challenge is that there's just so much. Subjectivity in our sector, and like a lot of the exercise in vetting a company is vetting not just your trust in management, but your management's interpretation of the FDA or interpretation of clinical data, and whether X or Y is cherry-picked, you know, and you see, like, in this sector, right? Like we feel like there's many times where companies have said something that's misleading and. There's no consequence to it because, ultimately, I think, interpretation of data, interpretation of science, interpretation of regulatory feedback is often. Super duper subjective, you know, I mean, we have. So I think, like, that's also a challenge to, like, when I talk to the occasional generalist who's looking at, like, a mid-cap biotech company and wants a 1000-foot view of it, like, the reality is, like, the controversies that are driving the stock. Might be related to some sort of esoteric biomarker and whether it truly does or doesn't correlate with progression, as well as the company's saying.\n\n00:13:02,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I just think these types of minutiae are, again, like, they're so. They're so subjective that it's like, really, really hard. Like what Scorny was saying, you know, we're so far away from generalists doing these sub-2 billion market cap companies. I mean, to some extent, maybe that's a good thing. I don't know. Whereas analysts, when we recommend names, we're supposed to think about suitability. I'm not saying all smidcap biotech should be off limits to generalists, but if you go back to like 2015, where there was tons of generalist interests and just things like gene therapy as a concept. It's like some of the people buying those stocks probably really didn't understand their true risks. And that's not a good thing either, because look at the outcomes there.\n\n00:13:48,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I would also echo that and say, look, I think it's like generalist interests largely become cyclical, right? And there's an element of like FOMO.\n\n00:13:57,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, when the sector really starts working. That's what will drive generalist interest. I think it's just— it's a sector that has been down on its luck for you know five years now and um, you know, without sort of an inflection and you know, launches that will pay out in. Big share price increases or big innovations that result in big. share price increases, you know, generals could just afford to not be involved only when it starts out performing. Do they have to be involved? Right. So so it's really a. A bit of a FOMO trade, and it's really only when you get that outperformance do you sort of force that interest to occur.\n\n00:14:39,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think that's right.\n\n00:14:40,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n Daphne, coming back to your other question, sort of what's going on with Pharma. So we are going through Pharma earnings. And you might recall that when J &J did their earnings, they were usually the first out of the chute. They said, 'Hey, intracellular was kind of like a one-off; don't expect us to do other 10 billion dollar deals And the commentary at the JP Morgan conference from the various large pharma was, 'Yeah, we'll be doing M &A this year, but think of more like smaller add-on type deals.' So it was very electrifying, I think, when we were starting to hear much more.","char_start":11881,"char_end":15777,"start_time":"00:11:41","end_time":null}

So it was very electrifying, I think, when we were starting to hear much more.\n\n00:15:13,510 [SPEAKER_4]\n Open discussions to larger M &A coming out during the earnings period. Pfizer said that they've got $10 billion plus to do M &A this year. So that was a surprise to me. Merck has also been talking up their capacity to do M &A, as have a number of other companies. And so I do think at the M &A Outlook continues to a positive, I will say, you know, I'm a banker. You know, one of many bankers who only see part of what's going on in the market. But I will say, just from the, you know, less visible pipeline that we're seeing, both our own but also from other groups, it's going to be a strong year for M&A in 2025. And so that should be a big positive for the market on top of. kind of what's going on on the political. Slash. macro side.\n\n00:15:59,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah and and you mentioned intracellular and that that would be the largest acquisition of a biotech company since the Karuna BMS deal and the fourth multi-billion dollar acquisition of a CNS drug developer in the last year or so. So let's actually talk about some CNS news that we had this week. Paul, you can start with GH research. which met its primary endpoints in a Phase 2B trial for a short-acting psychedelic drug in treatment-resistant depression. Take us through the data.\n\n00:16:29,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, sure. Thanks, Daphne. So GH announced data from their Phase 2B study. It wasn't a huge trial. It was 81 patients. But it was randomized, placebo-controlled. They evaluated patients on an eight-day primary endpoint and then also looked at durability and redosing out to six months. I mean, if you take a step back, like I think the psychedelic space has come an extremely long way in five years. Right. I mean, I think. You know, five years ago, right, there was still uncertainty around the FDA path of these things, right? We did have Spravato get approved. You know, some of the early companies had less experienced management teams. I think we're seeing more experienced drug developers join the C-suite of these companies.\n\n00:17:10,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, and I think, and then also, we've had data now from multiple randomized controlled trials, whereas a lot of the historical data was open label, or cases, or anecdotes. And so, for GH, I mean, this was a really big data set because we only had open label data before it. Their difference from placebo on the Madras, the approvable endpoint in depression, was a whopping 50%. 15 to 16 points. And, you know, usually companies are powering phase three studies in this space for like three points. And then, on the durability side, I mean, they showed that redosing looks to appear safe and they can get this pretty high remission rate over the long term. Their durability— or their treatment paradigm— in the open label was different than many studies I've seen because I think a lot of companies are kind of conscientious of not overdoing it on the redosing and trying to make sure that a patient has truly relapsed. You know, so sometimes you might have a restriction where you can't redose until there's a depressive episode for four to six weeks. You know, in this paradigm, right? I'm not saying they were, you know, redosing twice in a week, but at their scheduled visits, if the patient wasn't in remission, they just redosed, right?","char_start":15477,"char_end":19090,"start_time":"00:15:13","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_5b3a95aa371e_chunk_0005","doc_id":"doc_5b3a95aa371e","order":5,"text":" you might have a restriction where you can't redose until there's a depressive episode for four to six weeks. You know, in this paradigm, right? I'm not saying they were, you know, redosing twice in a week, but at their scheduled visits, if the patient wasn't in remission, they just redosed, right?\n\n00:18:13,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Which was kind of a bold move. And so, I think overall, the data are really impressive. You know, the biggest caveats here. Uh, which I know, Daphne, you wanted to opine on, and it's interesting to hear your perspective. One, there was, I think, pretty obvious functional unblinding in this study, given that the placebo arm just didn't improve at all. I mean, this is a fact, I think, of a lot of these psychedelic studies, but this was a more extreme example with the lack of placebo response. And then the second piece is GH is ultimately changing the medical device. It's administering this in future trials. You know, that always introduces risk, right? I mean, they have a clinical hold with the FDA on this device that they think they're going to resolve. But, you know, I think investors are going to want to see pharmacokinetic data. shows that you can really bridge these data into the next study. But, you know, broadly speaking, our view on psychedelics, I think, has improved a lot, notwithstanding the factors that I mentioned at the outset. Spravato, J &J's esketamine drug. requires a two-hour patient visit every other week.\n\n00:19:15,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n The drug only worked in two out of four randomized controlled studies, and yet it's annualizing at $1. 2 billion, right? So I think that this really lays the framework for a real commercial paradigm for this space, and there's reasons to be excited. Daphne, anything to add on your end?\n\n00:19:32,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, a few things. So first of all, when you have a drug approved for depression, these are among the most widely prescribed and commercially successful drugs of all time, and that's because of the huge unmet need. And so I think that That is. it's very important to have these drugs. I think also the general sentiment towards psychedelics has, you know, has improved quite substantially now that we're seeing randomized controlled studies. And like you said, strong management teams. They do have this issue of functional unblinding and also commercially having to have sort of a shaman there while the patient is having a psychedelic trip. can have commercial implications. But as we're seeing, you're still able to get some great commercial traction. The point of functional unblinding, I think, is only one of many challenges in neuropsych drug development. So even drugs that don't have a functional unblinding issue have other nuances that one really needs. A lot of experience and scar tissue in this field to manage well.\n\n00:20:35,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n Like, for example, some issues include challenges with patient selection, and there are ways to manage this by selecting the right sites. Very. closely scrutinizing patient enrollment, excluding patients that have big improvements from screening to baseline, excluding patients that might have adjustment disorder. For example, this was a big issue during COVID, where patients may have been enrolled that were reacting to the pandemic, rather than having proper MDD. A range of other ways to manage patient selection. And there are some intriguing biomarkers in development, which I think will be very helpful once they're validated. And then another big issue generally is that of high placebo responses. Obviously, we didn't see that here in the GH research study. And those can be managed by limiting assessments and other patient interactions or having only one active dose. So there is an inflated expectation that the patient is highly likely to be on active.\n\n00:21:29,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n And of course, that's assuming that you don't have to deal with hallucinations or other major unblinding issues and things like that.\n\n00:21:35,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that it's a very nuanced place. It requires experience. But, on the other side of it, lots of M &A interest and successful launches when you see them.\n\n00:21:50,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, I'm not sure. Actually, I'd love to hear from Abe. And also, maybe, Abe, you can tell us about the Axone Therapeutics migraine drug.

Approval and what you think about shorting the launch thesis in this case, given Biohaven.\n\n00:22:05,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. So, you know, good news from Axome.\n\n00:22:11,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n AXS07, brand name Simbravo, was approved.\n\n00:22:17,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n i think a couple interesting things here one we can talk about you know the aspects of the migraine market um where the opportunity might be here but also you know it's it's always great to see organizations overcome CRLs. I think it was mentioned earlier in the discussion. We know that drug development is not a linear process. know that the NDA submission is not a linear process. So the fact that although this seems to what it was was just a CMC issue, it's always great to see organizations be able to overcome those things and ultimately get products to patients.\n\n00:22:52,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n My view on the migraine market is it is still a large and underserved market. We saw kind of the emergence of CGRPs and really CGRPs being able to really provide patients with added benefit over triptans. But, you know, it still seems to be that CGRPs aren't meeting the needs for all patients. And I think that's been pretty clear, although there has been, you know, some successful launches such as the Biohaven launches you mentioned, Daphne. One of the dynamics that I think is really interesting here, in my opinion, when you look at the Axome kind of case study is I do. think that this market opportunity will be somewhat kind of an evolutionary tale, just given that the data that they have based on the approval and then the data that. be coming later this year. So one of the challenges is going to be the dataset.\n\n00:23:53,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think today really supports for those patients that are going to be unresponsive to triptans. Triptans, as we know, aren't great drugs. And I do think that there's a payer dynamic that the market is going to wait to see, to see how access will evolve for a drug for most patients that have to step through triptans. But the other dataset that I think will be interesting will be the dataset that I believe is coming at the end of this year that is looking at patients. That are more unresponsive to CGRPs, which I think could be an incremental shift, not only in terms of how payers may view. This compound, but also how it may open up kind of the overall kind of clinical utility and patient opportunity for the compound as well. So, a lot to be seen, I think, here over the coming months.\n\n00:24:55,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that Yes, there is a general sentiment, especially.\n\n00:25:03,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n As I think about the dynamics around this launch, that this will be kind of a show me launch from an investor perspective.\n\n00:25:12,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Knowing that payer dynamics are going to be a major gatekeeper to the uptake of this drug, given the fact that the universe is relatively broad in migraine, this will be something, in my opinion, that is going to be kind of a show-me launch.\n\n00:25:32,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Might also kind of have two stages of evolution. The data set that ultimately allowed for the drug to be approved, but another data set that's coming at the end of this year that may open up the market further for patients that are unresponsive to CGRPs.\n\n00:25:49,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n Would love to hear, you know, others' thoughts on this. You know, Paul, I know you know this space relatively well, but any other thoughts would be open to.\n\n00:26:00,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, migraine is a huge market. It's just a it's just one that's very it's very capital intensive. Right. So I don't know. The amount of resources that Axon's putting into this, relative to Bio, I mean Biohaven, spend was was really substantial. Right and um, you know, there was a lot of tailwinds for CGRPs, right? With five companies in that category, um, so it's probably something that you know might be— I don't have skin in the game there. I don't cover the stock, but it's a big market. And Pfizer's bet on Biohaven was getting this market more into primary care. And so, a huge opportunity, but one that requires a lot of muscle, I think, to do right.\n\n00:26:42,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n Brian, did you want to say more about Neurocrine?

You started to touch on it in the beginning.\n\n00:26:49,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think Paul was talking about Nuroquin. I hadn't mentioned Nuroquin, but I'm happy to jump in too. I'll let Paul take it. We both cover it.\n\n00:26:57,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, corny. I want to hear your thoughts, but like, I because I think, I mean, Neurocrine yesterday.\n\n00:27:03,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n So Neurocrine yesterday really surprised people because, you know, they miss numbers and Neurocrine is a company that has done a great job of consistently beating numbers and you know, consistently guiding conservatively and beating numbers. And then they guided 2025 below consensus. And this is for their drug Ingreza for charted dyskinesia, which is like ultimately like an enormous success story, right? I mean, I think when this drug launched, people thought it was a $700 million drug or something. And it's, you know, it's going to sell two and a half billion at the low end of guidance this year. So you got to put it into some perspective. But this is also a stock that had been kind of a safe haven growth stock, right, in a tough market where it's like. It's a mid-cap. It's profitable. They're launching another drug for a rare disease that should go relatively well. And the context of this, I think, that there's actually just like a broader conversation here that I love to hear other people's perspectives on because. There's the neurocrine-specific factors with this drug, right, where they've got greater competition from Teva. But I think one thing that's interesting, that we put in our note after catching up with the management team, is what they're seeing: that they're seeing greater payer pushback.\n\n00:28:07,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Without really a significant change in contracting dynamics in their market, and so what I mean by that is that in this part of this kinesio market, ingresses on some formularies, and not on other formularies. And that's been a specific or an intentional strategy to not over contract and over give back on price. And I think historically. I mean, the results tell you that's worked out really well for Neurocrine.\n\n00:28:33,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n And it hasn't been an issue, but you know, more recently, and I think we don't know exactly when this trend started, but let's say, sometime in 2024, plans have been pushing back more instead of kind of making a physician jump through more hoops. There have been more, a greater number of outright 'no's,' right? And I would imagine, given the guide, and given that it's February, that this continued significantly into January. And so, I think the implications of that for the sector broadly are sort of up for debate. I mean, maybe it's something specific to this category. Maybe TD just hit a tip. point where it's a $4 billion class, and that's a lot more than payers had really bargained for. Or it could be something related to small molecules. And I think that this could kind of be an indication of a broader Medicare Part D issue, where these highly expensive specialty drugs— for the non-Medicare Advantage patients— there's much greater cost sharing or payer liability. Of means for a lot of these drugs broadly, I think is an open question, right?\n\n00:29:34,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n How are payers going to manage that, right? They're probably going to manage it in different cases differently. This is something, you know, totally different area that we talk about. A lot with investors in the TTR space with Bridge Bio, Pfizer, and Almylam. But the print for Nurkin kind of put my radar up a little bit more for this, right? Because for those who don't know, under the IRA, for Part D drugs, for the catastrophic coverage portion of cost, which essentially all the cost of the drug after the donut hole. Um, you know, payers used to eat 15% of that catastrophic portion. Now it's 60%. And again, this is for the half of Medicare patients that are not.","char_start":27121,"char_end":31301,"start_time":"00:26:42","end_time":null}

I mean, if you're talking about a drug that's $100,000, I mean, the liability could go up, you know, $40,000, right? And so, anyways, I just think it put my radar up. Skourney, do you have any other thoughts? I mean, when you're kind of looking at this yesterday, what do you think about Neurocrine? And do you have, is this raising your eyebrows too, just like more broadly about payer dynamics changing this year for certain types of products?\n\n00:30:39,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so, I mean, I guess.\n\n00:30:41,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would have a slightly different take on it. I kind of thought the number that they printed was fine. I mean, it was, you know, slightly below consensus, but I think in line with expectations. I think it was really the guidance, as you brought up, that people are freaking out about.\n\n00:30:54,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's funny they gave 2. 5 to 2. 6; it was 2. 6 to 2. 7, I think the stock would be fine. Um, but it's just— and you you brought it up with them on the call. It's just kind of that change from like a 20% growth to a sub 10% growth. I think people would be okay if it was like teens growth. So that is the big question. There are, you know, a lot of factors going into this year in terms of changes, obviously, the Part D redesign, when you look at all the large cap companies talk. Um, you know, Bristol actually tells everyone to like go into Bristol Slide Deck. They really went through in a lot of detail what they think the the part the initial catastrophic coverage costs would be on the redesign for, like, Eloquist, which I think is a, you know, not as expensive, but a reasonable comp to try to understand how this could potentially impact those exposed to it. Um, you know, I always kind of think it's funny every time I do a follow-up call with Matt and the team, you know, they give me reasons. Why, uh, I should be more conservative on numbers, but then, they classically you know have wound up beating and raising throughout the year.\n\n00:31:57,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, and I do think that's an interesting dynamic. I mean, clearly, there are there's payer pushback with this catastrophic coverage. You know, one of the things I know you were there for our JP Morgan meeting, Paul, but, you know, I was asking him about, OK, but what about the resher of the out-of-pocket? Um costs for patients does that drive utilization and I think that's the big question right so one could argue or payers being tougher here because they see the potential for utilization to really grow in a lot of these markets because um the out-of-pocket costs for the patients are are much more limited um and you know that's kind of a back half of your question no you know there's not many companies are really committing to saying oh yeah like utilization will really increase and you know we'll have this front end loaded hit to revenue but in the back half you know maybe it'll really see a shift in terms of utilization So it's just something we'll have to watch out for. I'm not, you know, I think it's obviously an overreaction to see the stock where it is, given they also have a nice launch in Kronasserty.\n\n00:32:57,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, you know, that's sort of how I view it.\n\n00:33:01,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great. Tim, do you have any comments on any of the topics we've been talking about before we move on?\n\n00:33:07,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n No, I think we've had a good, good, robust discussion.\n\n00:33:11,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great. So one other thing that caught my eye this week was this merger of two companies that, at the end of the merger, they're going to have over 700 million in cash. And some commenters were asking, why not just return the cash? And this is a Loomis and a Celerin. Brian, I think you were covering this or you had some comments on it.

Can you comment?\n\n00:33:35,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. So I cover Illumis. I'm familiar with the cellar and I cover Amgen. I'm very familiar with the thyroid disease indication as a whole. And yeah, I mean, it was a pretty busy night last night to begin with. So to have this was kind of a bit of a shocker. I don't know if Tim has any knowledge of the history of transactions, but it's a pretty unique transaction. I don't really. Recall ever seeing the sort of two, you know, two companies with decent balance sheets, one much bigger than the other, merge and combine cash in such a way. You know, from the Illumis standpoint, of highlighted in my note you know you're looking at a stock that's six dollars and change, um, yesterday you know just about a 380 million dollar market cap they're bringing, 400 million dollars in cash, issuing 45 million shares. I mean, it's almost their full share count in issuance. But if they try, A, if they try to do anywhere near this size of a financing through a follow on offering, I mean, there's no way they could do it anywhere near the.\n\n00:34:40,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Six dollar and fifty cent price. Um, they just probably couldn't do it. I think there would be restrictions on on 100 you know, near 100 pollution. Um, but you know, if you do the calculation, is if they were doing this as an offering, it winds up being like a $9 per share offering. So, you know, I think it's very beneficial, certainly from the Illumis standpoint.\n\n00:35:00,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n It gets them a wealth of cash that gets them through a number of catalysts.\n\n00:35:05,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, and one of the big problems that I hear talking to investors is they just don't have catalysts. 2026 and and you know we've seen sort of these companies that see balance sheets dwindle quarter to quarter, they really get in kind of this death spiral, and I think this offsets that, and it's definitely unique relative to other transactions to raise money that I've seen.\n\n00:35:28,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n Just to comment a little bit, of course, I was not aware of this particular deal, but it reminds me very much of the merger of EQRX into Revolution Medicines, and you may recall that at the time of that merger, everyone was sort of saying, 'Why is he QRX giving Revolution Medicines?\n\n00:35:46,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n Their capital wouldn't it be better to return that money back to shareholders after all, shareholders know what to do. You know, the reality is, people that he corrects. Were very smart, right? So revolution medicines has done really well, it's been a great transaction for those shareholders. And if you look at this situation, what you see is Loomis has two very expensive clinical programs. They're going up to psoriasis. Had lupus and those are, those are. Cheaper is reminds me of the previous comments on migrating.\n\n00:36:17,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n And so with the capital coming from Accelerant, I think there's an opportunity to really supercharge. So I view this as kind of almost like a capital raised for limits. Of course, Accelerant does have some good stuff in there, and hopefully, those will also see the light of day.\n\n00:36:32,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n I should mention, I commented before that I saw M&A. being pretty robust. And one of the reasons is I've been aware of the Bane Mitsubishi. Kanabe.\n\n00:36:47,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n transaction and that transaction was literally announced.\n\n00:36:51,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n um as our hangout kicked off so I see it on hitting Endpoints News at 11. 06. uh this morning so so just very fresh transaction and so Mitsubishi Tanabe has just been sold for $3. 3 billion.\n\n00:37:08,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n you know, hats off to Bain. They're picking up. rights to radicava which has potential to be a billion dollar drug per the treatment of ALS in the US.\n\n00:37:21,350 [SPEAKER_4]\n You just reiterate, it's going to be a pretty interesting year for M&A, based on what I'm seeing.

So, Brian, Amgen recently launched a biosimilar version of Regeneron's ILEA. And looks like they generated about 31 million in sales in the last quarter of 2024.\n\n00:37:43,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n How is Regeneron reacting to this? Any thoughts on the dynamics between those two companies?\n\n00:37:50,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so I always tell investors these guys are sort of arch nemeses in the biotech space. They have a lot of overlap in multiple areas. There's been an ongoing battle in the PCSK9 space. On the commercial front as well as the legal front. Um, you know, they certainly don't have the nicest things to say about each other. So it's very interesting that Amgen. You know, amidst a range of other biosimilar producers who have targeted ILEA as a biosimilar, it's really the only one that's successful in getting an approval and then subsequent launch. After a legal decision, uh, late last year, and they're on the market with path blue, that's the biosimilar, and there's a lot of nuances and how they sort of got around the IP that, you know, the other companies that have filed biosimilars have not been able to do so far. But Regeneron stock has really taken a very significant hit. Um, over the last six months or so, as a result of both this and, you know, a bit of a slowing down on the launch of the HD ILEA, which is the high dose for version of ILEA that Regeneron's trying to get patients to switch to.\n\n00:38:59,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it's very interesting to me. Regeneron, I think, is one of the more colorful management teams, Lennon George being the founders. Running the company for the 30 years plus now at this point. And they are certainly very opinionated guys, as you all know. And, you know, interestingly, Regeneron kind of. With their earnings this week, they kind of reached a point where I was like, 'Oh, this is really a maturing company.' They announced the issuance of a dividend. They announced. Um, that they are increasing a share repurchase program—um, you know, something that you really see kind of larger, profitable pharma companies doing. And there's been a big question as to what Regeneron was going to do with this big cash balance that they've sort of generated. There's something about $18 billion in cash.\n\n00:39:43,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n very unique position with very little debt. So, you know, I think that was a very positive signal. And then it was very funny. People just kept asking questions about the ILEA dynamics, and it frustrated the CEO Len so much. He basically said, 'Stop asking questions on ILEA.' The Bank of America analyst came on with a question about ILEA, and he pushed her back. In the queue and said, we're not taking that question. Um and you know, it sort of got a lot of humorous emails from investors at that point about sort of the the dynamic of showing maturity of issuing a dividend and doing a buyback, but then simultaneously um telling all investors don't worry about like your most profitable product let's look at the pipeline and that's what you should focus on um you know, then Amgen reported 31 million in pap blue that's in nine weeks into launch you know I think it's a pretty impressive number you know a lot of feedback over the years in the ophthalmology space was that biosimilars wouldn't really take that much of a hold. And there would be the sentiment that you would want branded medicines that are expensive and have an ASPP.\n\n00:40:48,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n potential ASP plus six benefit for ophthalmologists over cheaper alternatives, but also having less frequent injections.\n\n00:40:58,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n It seems to have turned a little bit, and it certainly seems, even from a Regeneron standpoint, that they're a bit threatened by the Amgen-Papleau launch. And, yeah, Amgen sounded quite excited. So, you know, it's interesting to kind of watch these two guys go at it in a Regeneron sort of core focus.\n\n00:41:17,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, just to add to that, ILEA is at $9 billion.","char_start":38870,"char_end":43218,"start_time":"00:37:21","end_time":null}

You know, most people don't remember, but one of Biden's initiatives way back at the beginning of his administration was to make biosimilars reimbursement ASP plus eight. So, if you keep get your pricing right, you can actually create strong incentives for ophthalmologists to switch to buy similar. Which I think obviously something Engine's figured out.\n\n00:41:45,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n There are a lot of other ideas that are in development as well.\n\n00:41:48,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n We should expect to see the idea market become ever more competitive in the next couple of years.\n\n00:41:55,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. One of the things that's fascinating to me, you touched on this, Brian, this idea— I think broadly, we talked about management and what sort of builds credibility, what destroys credibility. And you talked about, on the one hand, guiding conservatively, I think it was Paul mentioned.\n\n00:42:14,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Or maybe it was you, Brian, that guiding conservatively then builds credibility and you know, the management tends to outperform. That's comforting to you.\n\n00:42:27,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Not saying nice things about each other. I think that's one that's fascinating and also being defensive and shutting down questions. That's also really interesting. I'd love to hear from Abe and then others, just this whole concept of management credibility, things that really destroy or build credibility. But in particular, I think this idea of being defensive and also bad mouthing your competition is one that's always been interesting to me.\n\n00:42:55,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Abe, do you have any thoughts on that?\n\n00:42:57,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sure and I would agree with kind of your kind of overall outline. I think you know, guidance, um and the concern Observatism yet realistic guidance is something that I think always builds credibility with management teams. And obviously, that takes on a bit of a different tone when you're guiding towards. Call it development milestones as a purely kind of R &D stage company, versus commercial milestones, because, you know, commercial revenue, prescriptions, et cetera. A bit more accessible to the audience, the investor audience, than what's ongoing with development. You really are the holder of that information. So I do think that one of the biggest challenges that we've seen in many organizations as they go from R &D companies to commercial stage companies. is actually preparing for being a commercial stage company as a management team and how you have to be able to effectively guide commercially, which in my opinion is just different from how you guide from a development perspective, because there's so many different things that you are thinking about\n\n00:44:12,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n and what you're in control of, and also things such as reimbursement access that you're partly in control of, but we also know that legislation, policy, et cetera, can shift beneath you. I'm a strong proponent of there is no reason ever to talk negatively about another company in your space. It always.\n\n00:44:40,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um surprises me when it happens. Uh, quite frankly, you know, um, I i i do maybe I'm a bit altruistic here that we're all doing this for a specific reason and that is to one help patients and to continue to provide returns to investors. And talking negatively about other companies in the space just seems to go against both of those things. I think back to my days at Cerevel and Daphne, you'll know this really well, Paul, you'll know this really well, and us kind of thinking about working with Karuna. And it's interesting now, as you guys know, I'm working with all the Karuna folks now. You know, we always believed that this was.\n\n00:45:24,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Muscarinics as a class were more important than the individual programs at the end of the day, because you know we saw this as a huge opportunity for patients and a huge market opportunity. So it does surprise me that this occurs, and then you know, defensiveness.","char_start":42918,"char_end":47311,"start_time":"00:41:17","end_time":null}

So it does surprise me that this occurs, and then you know, defensiveness.\n\n00:45:44,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think at the end of the day, there's, you know, some folks that feel that they have the right to push people in certain directions.\n\n00:45:54,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Also, it is a bit surprising to me because I don't think it's beneficial in the long run. But we know that there's certain dynamics that drive that, both on an individual level as well as kind of the history of the company with, you know, a given audience as well.\n\n00:46:09,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I could chime in for a second. And I'm sure Brian relates to this.\n\n00:46:15,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, when a management team is defensive, and if you're skeptical about something, I mean, to me, it usually makes me feel like I'm onto something, right? And the converse is often true. I mean, I've launched on stocks not supportive, and the company has been super cordial and excited about engaging, and those have actually often— or at least a few cases I can think of— been actually not great stock calls for me, but the stock actually did great. And I think the company's willingness to engage really reflected their confidence in what they were doing. I mean, I think, if you take a step back, like what I'm looking for as an analyst, and I think a lot of investors are looking for, is that when you ask the hard questions, it's not a gotcha. You just want to know that. company has thought— has tried to think of everything you know. I relate back to you know, another example. Abe, I mean, the cerebral corona dynamic um was really was a good one, right? But, you know, I think back to Steve Paul's comments after the first muscarinic phase two RCT, where he was really excited, but also said, 'Hey, you know, we have to be a little bit cautious here, right?'\n\n00:47:18,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, this is one study, you know, the extrapolate ability to Alzheimer's is still unclear. And, you know, I hear that and I think, like, okay, that's really comforting. This person's thinking about this as a scientist versus other times, right, when, you know, an early result is framed as, 'Oh, my God, we've cured this disease.' And now you can extrapolate to this, that, and that. And so I've talked to investors about this too, especially when we talk about the CNS space where trial conduct is so hard, but even just broadly, I mean, I think investors. They want management teams that, of course, can sell the bull case and sell the upside case, but also management teams that convey that they're, you know, a little bit paranoid. Right. And they're going to check every single box, um, to make sure that they don't get unlucky or, or something like that. And, you know, I don't know. I mean, Brian, you, you, you and I are both two sell-side analysts, right. Who are willing to not always, uh, not always be positive. You, you, you, um, you may be even more than me, right. I mean, you and I were talking at JP Morgan about this. And what's your kind of experience, right, when you're trying to poke and prod at certain things in companies?\n\n00:48:23,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n And how do you interpret feedback or receptivity?\n\n00:48:29,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, it's funny. I mean, I think you need kind of a track record with management to understand.\n\n00:48:36,319 [SPEAKER_1]\n Those dynamics, right? Like, so there would be, you know, there'd be some CEOs where, if they got defensive, I'd be really worried. There's other CEOs where I'm like, these guys are just naturally defensive. And they're always fighting over my comments, so it's not necessarily a read. The body language and the tone of management, I think, can be very specific to management. It's always funny to me.

I'm very friendly with that, or flashy. I kind of hate the concept of flashy upselling. Management teams, if you ask me, like who do I want to to speak to as a CEO? You know, it's someone who is very straightforward, kind of presents the bull case, the bear case, and has a good handle on on all of those dynamics. But it's not necessarily the same— you know—CEO that everyone else likes. So, it's very interesting. How you know it kind of takes all kinds. And, you know, one CEO is loved by an investor, but another investor can hate that CEO.\n\n00:49:39,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, totally. I mean, I think so. I agree with you. Right. I mean, I think we both have the same kind of taste. And, and I think just separately. Right. I mean, companies need to know that, you know, if Brian or I is asking. Some question that might feel like it's a tough question or might feel like it has some underlying element of skepticism embedded in it. I mean, sometimes it's a question that he or I thought of and came up with. Diligence. Often other times it's something that an investor is asking one of us. And I think, you know, I hear this in Scorny, I wonder if you hear this too, I hear too often, companies kind of almost like blindly blaming this concept of skeptical hedge funds or people trying to create. Narratives as a reason for tough questions or a reason for skepticism out there. And I think that they'd be surprised to know that, you know, a lot of folks that are long onlys or even big shareholders of companies are still ones that are asking themselves the tough questions and asking analysts tough questions because that's what makes them a great investor. I mean, I think even if you love a stock. In biotech, I mean, it's hard. It's hard to love a stock and still and never feel 100%, right, or even 90%, right?\n\n00:50:43,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, the stocks that I love, it's often, I think it's, you know, there's a 75% chance I might be right and there's a good risk-reward, but there's 25% of me that's still terrified about it. X or Y, right? Because that's the way this sector goes. And so I think knowing how to engage with that and knowing that you know, most analysts and investors who are asking these kinds of questions are not coming from like an actual place of an agenda. They're just trying to just trying to figure it out is probably the best approach.\n\n00:51:08,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah.\n\n00:51:10,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's science, right? It's it's it's a method of inquiry and that's, you know, what the sector is underpinned by. So I think it's no surprise that, you know, everyone in the sector should have critical questions. It doesn't mean you're trying to knock the stock down; it doesn't mean that you're a short. I mean, what it means is it may be that the person's short; it may be that they're trying to find holes, but it could be people just checking their position, right? And look, I'm not an investor, but the best investors—those I know— perform the best on a regular basis. They seem to really want to understand, um, where they could be wrong on something that they're long. So, you know, convincing you know getting them over that hump is very important. So, you know, I hate when CEOs sort of taping it like, 'Oh, it's the Shorts trying to push us back.' No, it's not. It's, you know, the entire investor base really wants to have all these nuanced questions answered.\n\n00:52:02,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n Maybe just one comment on this. I would agree with many of the things that you're saying, Brian and Paul.","char_start":50805,"char_end":54715,"start_time":"00:49:04","end_time":null}

I would agree with many of the things that you're saying, Brian and Paul.\n\n00:52:11,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know the the best place for a management team to be is to you know uh hold the same level of objective skepticism that the rest of the world does. Right, that, that, that, at the end of the day, and I think this might be one of the things that themes that you're pushing on Paul is— you know, there's a certain skill and I think a certain pattern recognition that evolves with great management teams. That you know, it's not just understanding what the bull case is. It's also understanding the bear case, but within understanding both of those cases, it's understanding what you're going to do next. As a management team, in terms of your overall strategy. So I often find, if you think about it that way, you don't you're not defensive right because that's just what you should be doing for your job. And being asked the questions that either push you down one path or the other is just kind of a natural sequence of, you know, what we do in terms of scenario planning and understanding what our paths are going to be as a company.\n\n00:53:19,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n But at the same time, you know, that takes time, right? That takes time, both the management team building, you know, the right rapport within the team, but it also really.\n\n00:53:34,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Is the relationship that is built with you know uh sell side analysts investors really understanding the management team and how they think, whether it's the CEO or the entire team.\n\n00:53:45,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and I think a lot of these points are also relevant as a CEO engages with the board, because the idea of showing that you're aware of the issues you've, and that you're not, you're not hiding or being overly optimistic. About the issues I think is really important, you know, also for the board and for other parties, including the team. And it reminds me of a discussion we were having with Josh Shimmer. He actually called, he had a name for the CEOs that never want to acknowledge that anything's wrong. He called them the 'everything is awesome' CEOs. So that was pretty funny. And maybe we can find that and reshare it here because I thought it was helpful. But I agree. And I think this is a really good discussion. We often come back to this topic of leadership, credibility, management, the whole interaction between.\n\n00:54:39,959 [SPEAKER_3]\n Management, investors, and the rest of the community, including, by the way, journalists.\n\n00:54:45,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n Teams that are very defensive and get angry at journalists. When they write something that's not entirely positive. Also, I think those have negative implications back to the company. So.\n\n00:54:58,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think we only had a couple of other news items and we're getting close to wrapping up. Not sure if any of you guys saw that Hymns Super Bowl commercial, but it was really obnoxious in many ways, especially the virtue signaling. They basically, they're still in the work of other companies selling an unregulated compounded version and also saying super negative things about the industry. And I think many ways are very kind of parasitic. The advertisement is. promoting the drug with no fair balance. So what happened actually just, I think it was yesterday, the Partnership for Safe Medicines has written to Cedar expressing concerns over the commercial.\n\n00:55:34,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n So let's see what happens with that. I don't know if any of you guys saw it, but it was really frustrating commercial. Did you guys see that?\n\n00:55:44,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n Deputy, I haven't seen the commercial. Thank you. I would say that in general, um most people in our industry are pretty skeptical of this compounded market that's crept up in these incretins. Thank you. I tend to take the other perspective. The compounders are actually very tightly regulated.\n\n00:56:05,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n Uh, if you listen to commentary from Nova Lily, you have this impression that you know there's these guys out there in their garages just whipping stuff up and selling it without much consideration. The reality is it's not only a highly regulated sector.","char_start":54415,"char_end":58839,"start_time":"00:52:02","end_time":null}

The reality is it's not only a highly regulated sector.\n\n00:56:25,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n But. The pricing of the blends that's available online is allowing access to these drugs to reach a whole other group of people that otherwise would not be able to access them. So I'm not saying that the commercial is fine. In fact, HIMSS is sort of obnoxious in general and how they approach people. So I'm not. You know, defending them as a company, but my impression is that there is a place for this market. and Oba have just been going to great lengths to essentially knock these guys out, including using you know organizations that sound like they're independent organizations that are actually being indirectly funded. To discredit the compounding.\n\n00:57:13,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, watch the commercial. They're basically talking about how the drug industry is taking advantage of, you know. Patients and all this stuff. You got to see it.\n\n00:57:21,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe we'll link to it. I'm not defending it. I'm just saying. I actually think compounding has been one of the more interesting developments because it's allowed patients to really go at it. get access to drugs online on their own, really for the first time. In a major way, Bye. Since our industry has begun— 20, 30 years.\n\n00:57:41,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, we should talk about this more broadly at another time, because I think there's some really interesting aspects to this, including the idea that a company will be investing years and millions— even close to a billion dollars— in R &D.\n\n00:57:57,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n Other companies could benefit through kind of this loophole. And I know that it's temporary, but I think it's an interesting topic to come back to. And I agree that there's a place for compounding. And in this case, where the the drugs were really quite expensive and they didn't they had shortages], there was a reason, there was a rationale behind it, but you just have to see this commercial.\n\n00:58:21,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, Anyway. We had, I think, one, we maybe go around and just do closing comments. Tim, you had mentioned something about Jay Bradner's interview with Paul on China or something like that. So maybe you can wrap up with that and any other closing comments.\n\n00:58:37,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, just to give a couple interesting tidbits, Paul did a very interesting interview this week with Jay Bradner. Bradner said engagement with the FDA is business as usual. He is not concerned about the FDA commissioner going wildly up the case. Uh, he said that there's tons of free cash flow and firepower for MA and big pharma. He said it's really the supply side dynamics. He pointed to CAR T.\n\n00:59:05,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n saying there's, you know, one. It was great to have one good one and now there was another 200. Like, how many of these do you need? He said that Chinese science is going from being non-existent to fast follower to now being really innovative. And sees China as important. Competitors, a very interesting story also in the journal today about Chinese competition. Those were a couple of the things that came up with Paul's very interesting interview.","char_start":58539,"char_end":61944,"start_time":"00:56:05","end_time":null}

For more information about our hosts, and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode. Please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:26,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n So we often like to start off with kind of market sentiment.\n\n00:00:32,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n So before we jump in, it was a big earnings week. I wanted to highlight there was a news um reporter, an article by Adam Feuerstein that was posted, and it was entitled, 'Biotech is in a Dark Place.' And he basically highlighted that, you know, it's been a long slog over the last several years and we're not really seeing major signs of optimism. Interest rates remain high. He highlighted a few things. And notably, he thought that we just took too many biotech companies public with 700.\n\n00:01:09,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n public biotech, he felt that you know, we could almost impose a rule where we have to. you know, delist three of those before we let one new IPO come.\n\n00:01:19,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n The idea that, you know, 200 or so are trading below cash, and that, you know, this isn't the sign of a healthy market. Interestingly, there was an exchange on on X] where Jason Kelly, the co-founder of Ginkgo Bioworks, was kind of challenging him a bit and wanting to instill more optimism by citing Lilly and Novo's successes and value creation. And so, you know, but you know, there are exceptions to the rule always, but you know, we'd love to hear either of your thoughts on this and just market sentiment. And I know you guys have a sector performance sentimentometer here that you do. So any comments or thoughts to this sentiment and anything that your data is showing to either support or rebut that?\n\n00:02:07,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. So maybe let me, so we do two different products. You mentioned one is a centimometer, which is a big survey. We get like 150, 180 investors.\n\n00:02:19,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, chiming in every quarter, and we've been doing this for around 15 years. Uh, and we also in the beginning of each year we do a sector performance notes. We do two— one using the J. P. Morgan and the sector performance after J. P. Morgan as a predictor for the year, because it's a big conference, and then we do it for our Cowan conference, because that's probably the second big one. So maybe I'll just chime in really quickly on both.\n\n00:02:43,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n History is a sane advisor, and it's not always perfect, but it's a lot more predictive than not. And we started this year flat, and you would think, 'Hey, that's good' or 'That's bad.' Well, in the last 24 years, because we go back to thousands, we only started flat like three times. And usually, when we do that, we're kind of flat to down.\n\n00:03:07,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n And we then outperformed right after JP Morgan, and then we gave it all back. If you look at our performance, then overlay that on top of it. We started last year the same way. People were very much hiding in large caps. By the end of last year into the election, we were at an all-time high enthusiasm. For small caps, and investors were looking for performance. And when you look at the centimometer historically, that was an outlier. So you knew we should be correcting somewhat. Well, then we hit the wall with the election. The good news— The centimometer is now back to winter's coming, winter's here, and it reversed drastically. Usually, it takes about two quarters to bottom. Outliers? So I think we're getting back to people are, you know, pretty freaked out for a good reason, right? We're hearing like it's never been this bad. It's over. The VC venture model is broken.\n\n00:04:06,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, this is kind of when you start hearing things like that.\n\n00:04:10,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, you know, to me it feels like we're getting to the bottom slowly.","char_start":0,"char_end":4120,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

You know, the macro side a little bit. I think we're getting closer to the bottom. You know, things kind of bottom faster, but it might probably be another three months until we bottom.

Sam, I know you cover a lot of larger cap names and look at individual stocks, but any comments on this and the broader sentiment from what you're seeing?\n\n00:05:03,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I just had a question actually, Chris, for your own.\n\n00:05:07,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n What's the composition of the Eyesiders. Is it generalist mostly? 50-50? How does it hang?\n\n00:05:14,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n No that's spot on. That's a great question as always. It's mostly sector specialists, 90% from the US and uh, long-short, uh, and long only. In long-short, probably more long-short and long only, just more of those around.\n\n00:05:32,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, that's interesting. I mean, look. I know we like to beat up the XBI because it's not a perfect, I mean, Josh has deliberated on this quite a bit and explained.\n\n00:05:43,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n But it is an index where, when Daphne was talking about generalists last week, it is an easy index to use to see how the sector is doing. So I've just got it open in front of me on my Bloomberg.\n\n00:05:55,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, which was, well, did somebody put it out saying five years of nothing? It's correct. It's exactly five years of nothing. And at the same time, the S&P 500 has doubled. So. It's not difficult to be pessimistic when you look at this. If you plotted this back to 20 years ago, it actually doesn't look that bad. But then who on earth invests over a 20-year horizon, apart from a few super long-onlys who are mostly their own money? I don't know how that works. But so, and Chris, from that inflation perspective, you know, we just had the CPI this week. It's been a very, very interesting week. Things that people expect to go down have gone up. Things that people expected to go up have gone down. And CPI printed with surprisingly fast gains in headline and core. CPI indices, but you know we've looked at that. I think a whole host of other economists have looked at it and initially, when everybody thought, 'Oh, that's it it's going to be a major uh pressure on the Fed to raise, which we keep talking about because we want them not to raise.\n\n00:07:01,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n And actually, we want them to cut interest rates so that we don't have to worry about the micro pressure on our sector. But our view is that it's a January effect. And I think that's been pretty widely spoken about. However. That doesn't change the fact that maybe this impacts the next decision that the Fed makes, but it doesn't change the dynamics of 2025. That if these tariff talks and a whole variety of other things that are quite inflationary continue to be pressuring sentiment, then we may see at some point an interest rate rise.\n\n00:07:35,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. Uh, Trump has made comments, uh, to the Fed and feds, independent. They do what they think is right and best.\n\n00:07:43,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n Nonpartisan. And so Trump's trying to urge for, you know, we need to reduce interest rates. But I think, look, we're almost near peak uncertainty right now with the first hundred days of the new administration.","char_start":3822,"char_end":7886,"start_time":"00:04:06","end_time":null}

Impacts, hopefully, over the next several months will reduce some of that uncertainty, you know, good or bad, whatever side of the ledger, uh, that will have you know, I think markets thrive on more certainty, right, and will respond accordingly. So it'll be interesting to watch. But, you know, speaking of this kind of buy-side survey, Jeroen, I don't know if you saw this, but Daphne highlighted this article that I was not as familiar with: 'Armistice Capital.' However, Um, when I looked at their holdings, they have a lot of biotech and they tend to be larger-cap biotech. However, they made the news because the Wall Street Journal had an article that basically stated: instead of giving redemptions when you, when you are a hedge fund investor, typically you can pull your money out, you know, whenever you're you know, you want. And in this case, they said, well, because of thinly traded assets.\n\n00:08:45,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n They issued IOUs. Instead of giving those redemptions. And this is after a fund that has performed pretty well over the last year. Um and you know, have holdings in the top 10 like PTC and Supernos and Argenix and Insight Cytokinetics. So you know, I'm not sure if there's any dis here in terms of why they would issue IOUs unless they're holding a lot of private names. Or I'm not sure if the redemptions were higher, but do you know? Anything about this or any comments on this Armistice news? And I want to believe that it's an anomaly and not anything beginning of a trend for biotech hedge funds, but curious if you saw that.\n\n00:09:29,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, we we did and um, I think in that again, we don't have any information other than what's in the uh, in the article. A lot it's almost like there's two different kinds of portfolios there in a way. There's a portfolio that is linked as a portfolio of a lot of warrants and illiquid assets. And so I think that was a part of the issue. The part of the issue was—um, a lot of this, as you know very well, a lot of these funds do deals and they do pipes and they take a lot of warrants which are unbelievably profitable these things work out right but they're illiquid. And so the issue when you suddenly have all these redemptions, what do you do?\n\n00:10:08,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting if they really are holding that many. I mean, they have 250 and they have consumer. names as well but they have like almost 250 public names so you'd think that there'd be enough diversity. And even that, not that concentrated, even at the top with names that. I'd be surprised if they didn't hold direct equity. So anyway, interesting to watch, just shows the dynamics in the market and actually the idea of outflows and people taking money out of biotech, that's not a bullish sign, but it might be specific to this fund. Well, it was a big earnings week, and so both of you have covered some names. Jeroen, you want to start with Ascendus and Exalexis?\n\n00:10:51,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, absolutely. And, you know, one of the things, as you can imagine, with this is a perfect segue. We've been talking about difficult markets. I can tell you, I feel like there is an unbelievable amount of innovation going on. And now, there are many companies in the mid-cap, actually, in the mid-cap, upper end of the mid-cap. Caps or even now, the younger, large-cap companies that are turning profitable this year. So this year, Beijing and Argenix are going to be profitable. Spring works, which we might come back to in a minute later on. Is going to be profitable early next year. Legend, Ascendus will turn profitable late this year into next year.\n\n00:11:31,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n Basis, obviously, and then Ultragenics kind of late 26 into 27. So we are in the middle of an innovation cycle. Ascend is— is about to launch your VPath or they just launched your VPath for Hypopth they're off to a really strong launch in the US they've done well in Europe last year um they're also going to be filing their CNP, their TransCan CNP, which will compete with Biomarin's Vaxogo.","char_start":7586,"char_end":12020,"start_time":"00:07:43","end_time":null}

It'll be important for FDA to accept that. So that hopefully will add a nice launch because biotech needs them for your VPath this year. We are waiting for the AstraZeneca. Phase three for inibiparatide, that's their version of that daily injectable PTH, that should be coming imminently. We think it's probably going to be a year and a half behind. And a little bit of a 'me too'.\n\n00:12:23,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n But that's Ascendus. That's a stock that many people like now. Exelixis, as you remember, they have Cabo, which is about just over a $2 billion brand globally. It's a TKI for renal cancer and HCC. They should beat numbers this year as they launch neuroendocrine tumors. And they recently won their case against Jigeneric. So we know now they have protection until 2030.\n\n00:12:47,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n But now they have a new cycle with Zanza, which is the Zanza litany. That's the next version of Cabo that's in phase three. So they're finally going to flip the card this year. Uh, with early data on head and neck, phase two, and then phase three in colon cancer.\n\n00:13:04,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n The early data so far has not ample differentiation against Cabo. And so the stock is kind of in a hover. People are hoping it's going to get acquired, but it's probably not going to get acquired. And whether it goes up a lot or not depends on how Zanza does. So this year, we're going to see a lot of data from Zanza. And so there's going to be a lot going on in biotech.\n\n00:13:24,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. It used to be that biotech would want to delay some biotechs. There are always exceptions, but they would want to delay getting to profitability because, already, as a commercial stage company, you're valued on your revenues. But once you hit earnings, then you really are judged on the pennies. Right, that you're delivering to the bottom line. Really, he kind of moves away from the promise of a pipeline or the promise of, you know, an engine that can produce continued growth. Just thoughts on that. I mean, Vertex famously remained unprofitable for many, many years, pouring more and more into R &D and ultimately pays off. You could use Amazon in a different sector as an example. But any thoughts on this as you start to highlight these companies that are going to turn profitable?\n\n00:14:19,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, absolutely. And Simon chimed in. So I'll give you, so you're right. We're sort of, what's going on now? We're in the middle. Some companies are profitable for a while, Argenix, Beijing, but they're finally getting to a point that. They're unbelievably profitable because they're going to be market-leading positions. What are GenX with the FCRN?\n\n00:14:39,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n Jane with market-leading BTK, Brookings. Legend, you know, with J&J's launch, Krivikti, what, three years ago, and they'll be profitable next year.\n\n00:14:49,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's a function of success, ascending this uh, they launched Skytropha growth hormone, what two, three years ago, and they'll finally uh be profitable. Ultragenics that's been a long story, they'll turn profitable in two, three years, based on launching four additional products. Um, Springworks is probably the fastest one they launched, essentially last year, and they'll be profitable kind of within two years. Of course, with Springworks, we'll come back to it, whether they'll even be around. But I think there's just a lot of pressure because companies can't continue to raise money forever anymore. Yep, yep. Sam, any comments on that?","char_start":11720,"char_end":15637,"start_time":"00:11:57","end_time":null}

Yep, yep. Sam, any comments on that?\n\n00:15:25,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, I mean, look, at the end of the day, nobody wants to be owning a profitable biotech company whose profitability is going up at 10% a year. That's not why you invest in it. At the end of the day, if you've got a situation like an aerogenics that can show a significant ramp— or you're better off continually investing in R & D— then I think that's the way to do it. Um, I, I, you know, I think we'll get to Moderna in a minute. They hit profitability by, but I don't want to call it luck, but one year or two years. And then of course, it's all about R &D investment now, right?\n\n00:16:03,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, well, and yes, I think, you know, primarily if you end up driving cash flow. profitability, your stock currency will go up. as a result, then really how you use that currency, your stock currency and your cash, to acquire build. right you know, whether it's internal pipeline, R&D spend, or external acquisitions. it'll be interesting and yeah, Moderna that there is that black swan event that kind of led them to over $100 billion market value. But yeah, why don't you give us an update? What's the latest on Moderna?\n\n00:16:33,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n So they had is one of the stocks that I was talking about being all over the place today. At one point, the stock was halted because.\n\n00:16:41,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n Because of volatility, and I think headlines really have a lot to do with how some of these shares trade into the open. And, uh, they they reported for Q today nothing really new in there for me from a numbers perspective. They had clearly guided before, and lucky, happy— Maybe that's why the stock's a little bit up now. They didn't change their guidance, which they only really gave about a few weeks ago at JP Morgan.\n\n00:17:12,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n 2025 is, uh, you know, people were wondering if 2024 the bottom, but now 2025 could be the bottom, though they have a massive range in terms of revenue guidance, which is one and a half to two and a half. The consensus is still a little bit ahead of that, so they need to come down. But the elements that really got people a bit confused today was this thing: a clinical hold on the norovirus vaccine.\n\n00:17:36,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, and you know, maybe softer than expected commentary about the timing of their CNB vaccine. Um, and maybe you know, you can keep adding to it—perhaps the flu vaccine in terms of the combo, which I have a strong um belief in— would be a major thing for them, having a COVID flu combo vaccine available.\n\n00:18:00,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, that they may need to wait for the phase three data for their flu vaccine data to come through before they can get that through the regulators.\n\n00:18:10,659 [SPEAKER_2]\n Of uncertainties there, but I don't think any of them were really that new to me. I mean, okay, clinical holds are always new, but that was easily explained. So what we're all waiting for now is the timing of that cancer vaccine. I mean, that, to me, is what is going to change the trajectory for this company.\n\n00:18:27,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and Bristol had some news on that. Do you want to cover that? They did.\n\n00:18:31,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n They did. And it wasn't obviously a cancer vaccine. It was a dualag, which is a lag-3. uh pd1 uh combination, which has worked very well in metastatic melanoma. In that it gives you very similar efficacy with better side effect profile compared to Ipi Nevo, which is the Yervoy Updevo combination, which was the standard. Care until Obduelite came along, and it failed in adjuvant. So I've been talking to somebody in whom I have 100% trust on the KOL side with regards to melanoma, and there are several reasons that this could be the case. But let's put that aside. It's not good news for Bristol. But what it means is that this was potentially something that was going to change the bar. In adjuvant therapy for melanoma, which is of course the key dataset coming out first for Moderna, so at least to it to a degree, a negative has been taken away. On the other hand, this is a trial that I think most people expected to see some positive impact from.","char_start":15337,"char_end":19775,"start_time":"00:15:25","end_time":null}

On the other hand, this is a trial that I think most people expected to see some positive impact from.\n\n00:19:34,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n And it didn't work out. So you have that same situation now for Moderna. They had a phase two trial that was small. That was controlled by the controller arm, which was just Keytruda.\n\n00:19:46,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Didn't quite look as good as Keytruda should have looked. So you've got this thing at the back of my mind. And your mind going into the data coming out at the end of this year, possibly next year? Um. As to whether this is going to hit. And that's the, you know, they've made a big bet on it with Merck, right? I think Jeroen covers Moderna too, right? Jeroen? I'm not sure.\n\n00:20:06,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n I cover Biontech. My colleague has the luxury of covering Moderna.\n\n00:20:11,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. All right.\n\n00:20:13,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, you've got the winner at the moment on an enterprise value basis.\n\n00:20:17,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's right. And remember they. Yeah, because they've been diversified the whole time. They were also lucky, you know, in terms of profitability.\n\n00:20:26,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n Not so much anymore on that side.\n\n00:20:28,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. Sam, you want to cover GSK, their earnings this week as well?\n\n00:20:33,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, no. So, I mean, obviously, it was actually a very good week for them in terms of the numbers that came out. And earnings were.\n\n00:20:42,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, last week, I think, if I remember correctly. So what was very interesting in this particular comment, that is what I wanted to talk about during the earnings related to Moderna. They refer to the RSV vaccine market as a two-player market.\n\n00:20:59,449 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, I don't think that's arrogance. When you look at the RSV vaccine sales from Moderna, you kind of believe that perhaps that's the right way to look at it. and um And that's one of the challenges for Moderna. So that was the comment I was going to make in relation to Moderna from a GSK side. And I don't think they've ever said this before so clearly.\n\n00:21:21,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I think that comment is based on the kind of conversations they're having with payers at the minute. That just creates extra headache for Moderna and makes it even more important that this cancer vaccine trial result positively. Yep.\n\n00:21:37,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yaron, one of the leading indicators that everybody's looking for is the health of the IPO market.\n\n00:21:43,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know it's something that needs to be sustained for a couple quarters, but um. You know, if you can kind of comment on kind of recent IPOs and IPOQ. And Sam, I know you've followed Aardvark IPO as well. So, Jeroen, why don't you tell us what was the state of the IPO market?\n\n00:21:57,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so the IPO markets is, I would say, Companies in general, let's start with the quality there, have gone tremendously better, right? They're all more mature, a lot of them have data, they're in phase two, more innovative. And those are always going to be the ones who go out first. So inevitably, or kind of earlier companies, but really good pedigree. So if you look at the end of last year, there's been very several very high profile IPOs that did very well. And then recently, Metzera and Siona, both fairly differentiated, one obesity, one in CF.\n\n00:22:32,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Obesity, you can argue, has got some competition.\n\n00:22:35,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n CF, you know, it's really vertex and there's not a lot of competition. So these are sort of the cream of the crop. But if you look at the The landmark IPOs from the end of last year, without any news, have all have done really poorly. So look at Saturna, down 50%. This year alone, with no news, down 60% from the highs. Upstream bio, down 54% this year, up/ down 74% from the highs. Upstream bio, so what's going on with the market? People want to invest in new assets.","char_start":19475,"char_end":23625,"start_time":"00:19:34","end_time":null}

People want to invest in new assets.\n\n00:23:06,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n But then they start getting, because of valuation or because of the pedigree, but then they start getting pretty worried. And this is the triumvirate that we're seeing. And this kind of speaks to why I'm thinking. That we're probably going to have to bottom at some point in the next few months, shortly. People are concerned about anybody that needs to raise money at some point in the future. Well, that's 100% of biotech's almost. 99%. Anybody that's going to have competition, and look, there's going to be various levels of competition. And then people start about market opportunity, which is really too early to start discussing. That's usually a discussion much later on. But that's the— Anybody that has no catalysts or any inkling of competitive data who will raise money later on is absolutely getting penalized right now. And let's see how the IPOs do three months after they go out. The good news, there's a great reception. The question is, what's the staying value?\n\n00:24:03,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n In general, Jeroen, are they raising enough money in the IPO where they can get to a catalyst event before diluting at a lower valuation potentially? Are they feeling like, all right, we've got our cash, we'll prove the market? with our data catalyst, or are some of them you think will fall short of that?\n\n00:24:23,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n So the good ones, and you nailed it on the head, the good ones, you know, you look at Septerna, absolutely. You look at Upstream, absolutely. You look at Matteo Siona, they—they've absolutely raised enough money.\n\n00:24:38,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? As these go lower and lower, because people get worried, they begin to wonder, 'Well, if you open a model of most of these companies, they're going to have to raise hundreds of millions of dollars between now and five years from now.' And they start getting worried. And that's just, you know, it's a function of the times right now. That will reverse.\n\n00:24:56,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. Sam, the obesity market remains high. Do you want to cover Aardvark here?\n\n00:25:02,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so Armburg is one of these IPOs that Jeroen was just talking about that unfortunately complete opposite to the Matera IPO. Matera was a I would tell you a I don't want to call it plain vanilla in a negative way, but it's a standard obesity play]. GLP-1, GIP, amylin, all the variety of mechanisms. [In their portfolio] so and that's done really well Excuse me]. Aardvark came out with a more nuanced approach, of course, and that's starting with some of the more genetic weight or hunger issues, let's call it that. And that's the Paderwilli syndrome, so PWS, and they have a hypothalamic obesity. [Uh indication also and so they came out with an ipo] they raised um around 90 90 or plus 95 94 million dollars um gone out looking for, I think, 16 to 18. They priced at 16. And unfortunately, it's trading at 13. 8 or 13.\n\n00:26:03,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n 7 now.\n\n00:26:07,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n It went out yesterday. They have a differentiated approach to a market where there is a competitor that's already out there with a $2 billion valuation. And that's Selina. So, for people to benchmark them, it's not that difficult, although Selena is much further ahead with a with their drug for PWS and they're they're filed with the FDA. It's a different mechanism of action. They have similar kind of data from an earlier, obviously much earlier patient, much earlier trial in terms of Aardvark. And they do have ideas for obesity in general. I'm a little bit more skeptical there, but you do have a blueprint to compare it to.","char_start":23325,"char_end":27287,"start_time":"00:23:06","end_time":null}

Um. It's a very small rear indication. but so the ip has not done as well as as as well i mean it's down so um what what's going to turn that around um and they won't they didn't raise you know talking about the hundreds of million dollars that are required i don't know how much more they need but certainly not enough from the IPO to get through to the end of their round. It'll play. I'm pretty sure.\n\n00:27:23,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, do you think there's a uh less likelihood for M. A. on these more niche uh rare uh obesity indications, given everybody's trying to to get the big ticket high prevalence indications.\n\n00:27:38,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, just curious if that blunts a little bit of, you know, Selena's done, you know, it is a great comp, but I'm just curious if. M. A.\n\n00:27:45,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n if we're discounting that for these more niche obesity I would for now, because their approach is, when you look at the data that they've got, it's very early. And they do show with a fixed-dose combination that they've got with ARD 101.\n\n00:28:04,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n Plus a DP4 inhibitor that they do show that they could enhance the effectiveness or efficacy of a GLP-1. The issue is that you need a meaningful trial to prove it. and you need to um to do that in a way that is meaningful beyond uh comparison to the triple g that's coming up beyond comparison to. So these are issues that have to be dealt with. And I just can't see.\n\n00:28:35,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n an easy way for these to become M &A targets until they've got some really hard, good quality obesity data.\n\n00:28:43,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. Um, all right. You run. You reference SpringWorks. Works uh earlier. You want to you know elaborate on that.\n\n00:28:50,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, absolutely. And Chris, to your last question, I mean rhythm. Right has been an orphan sort of obesity play for a while and they're still independent, you know. Yeah, stock's been volatile, but finally doing pretty well. Uh, the product looks really good. Covered by my colleague Phil. So SpringWorks. Um, so SpringWorks, you know, as some of you might know, as a company, it's got two.\n\n00:29:10,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n A neuro uh targeted oncology drug. Uh, the first one is for desmoy.\n\n00:29:17,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's actually more of a sarcoma, but it's got a little bit of a neurocomponent at times. And the second one is a MEK inhibitor, now approved, Gomekli, for neurofibromatosis 1. Uh, flex form. Uh, form that's going to compete with Astrazeneca Lugo Casalugo last year. Casalugo got approved five years ago and it sold 31 globally last year.\n\n00:29:39,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Pediatrics only. Gomecly from SpringWorks has a better label for adults and peds and much cleaner, much fewer warnings. It's also a MEK inhibitor, fully owned, so that should do pretty well to launch in the U. S. and then late this year in Europe.\n\n00:29:54,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Last year. Zivios got approved for Des Moines. Crushed numbers the first year. I think consensus was like 45, 50 million. They put up almost kind of around 170 in the U. S. ( us alone) and they're going to be lawyer up late this year. Um, this is the management that I think historically talked about— you know, getting acquired. Um, the question was always: these are kind of orphan oncology assets, originally spun out of Pfizer. So who would really buy them? It's always been a discussion of like an Ipsen or Jazz or Servier. Like Exelixis, but the issue is this would end up being a $5 billion deal. We're talking about consensus estimates of, let's say, a billion and a half in sales for this portfolio. Those companies are too kind of small to do this deal. Well, now there's been rumors and Merck KGa confirmed that they have been in discussions.\n\n00:30:44,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n Springworks, by the way, is reporting next Thursday. So we anticipate a deal is going to get announced probably Tuesday or Wednesday ahead of that. Merck KGa would make a lot of sense. $60 billion market cap, $21 billion in global sales.","char_start":26987,"char_end":31471,"start_time":"00:26:53","end_time":null}

They're globally oriented. They could take these assets globally. Um, so we we think it would make a lot of sense. The stock is trading now up nicely from 32, post JPM, where there was no expectation for a significant increase.\n\n00:31:15,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's at 58. And we do think it's going to make sense. We're expecting a deal next week.\n\n00:31:21,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, it's interesting to watch the trajectory. SpringWorks has done a phenomenal job from when this was a Pfizer. Spin out with Bain investing early on. And if you look at the peak of the market, they hit $90 a share in February of 2021. It just shows you even the most successful companies with some more dilutive financings, obviously they're higher value, but even their recent multi-year peak of over $60. Still isn't where that peak was, just kind of a contextual data point for the last five years or so. So with that, Sam, you also had another Zillio and AbbVie. Do you want to talk about that?\n\n00:32:04,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so that's an interesting one. Talking about companies trading below cash and nobody caring, etc. It doesn't mean they don't have anything interesting.\n\n00:32:13,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n This is a deal that Zillio signed. Zillio had an enterprise value below obviously negative enterprise value. And when they. announced the deal, the share price went up like 117%. It's come back a little bit now. But if you add in the cash that they're getting from AVI, they're still trading below cash. So, and there might be a fair reason for it. So let me just describe what the story is here. This is another mass T cell engager. So we've talked about GenX, which is last year, we talked about VR, which was more this year with the data coming out. And both of those stocks went up and then they've retraced a little bit. And here they've done it. Deal with AbbVie, but it's an option deal, i. e.\n\n00:32:58,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n Azilio is going to be doing the work with masked T-cell engagers, which is their technology. They can mask the CD3 binding site, the antigen binding site, or even they have another version of their T-cell engager, which brings with it a co-stimulatory molecule. They can also mask that.\n\n00:33:17,439 [SPEAKER_2]\n The deal is to do discovery work with App-V. So it's not on any of their particular pipeline assets, from what I understood at the minute. Um, which of course means that they're likely to be spending the money they've just got from Abdi. And when they spoke on their call, uh, for the they only have now cash for first quarter 26. So it's only that's only 12 months and that means that they're going to have to raise again. And that would clearly need some news or some reason for investors to be. to be wanting to go in. Which of course the app video might help them. Um. And it just— are we at the beginning of a of a renaissance of the mass t cell engager world? Um. Having watched cytomics and bristol myers for a long time, I don't know. I don't want to. I don't want to make pronounce your pronouncements like that until we see updated from Janix and Veer with longer duration follow-up, et cetera, and genuinely see whether higher dosing can give them higher efficacy.\n\n00:34:19,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think there's still some wood to be chopped here for the masking world. Um, but that was an interesting example of a negative enterprise value company that managed to get a deal with a meaningful farmer.\n\n00:34:30,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I'll just add, we had a company we invested in, Landos, that was public, trading at a negative enterprise value that we did get a 200-plus percent premium from AbbVie. So they are definitely shopping. Not averse to going for public companies that they feel are undervalued and fit their pipeline well. Last topic before we move to our special guest from BioCentury. Do you want to just cover Enaptis Bio and their drug and RA?\n\n00:34:56,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, again, that's been quite interesting. As some of you know, we have a very active Bloomberg, a very active.","char_start":31171,"char_end":35599,"start_time":"00:30:44","end_time":null}

Do you want to just cover Enaptis Bio and their drug and RA?\n\n00:34:56,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, again, that's been quite interesting. As some of you know, we have a very active Bloomberg, a very active.\n\n00:35:04,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Client anonymous chat where, when the data came out, a lot of people were questioning it and whether it was good enough, et cetera. And in the end, this was an R8 dataset that came out. And the share price kind of speaks for itself. The stock was trading at, I can't remember now, maybe $12 or $13 or thereabouts. And now it's just over $20. So what is the approach? So, Anaptis drug is essentially a PD-1 agonist, which immediately scares the bejesus out of me a little bit. When you're going in doing the opposite of what you do with immuno-oncology drugs, which is to act to kind of um tamp down the T cell response. And that worries me a little bit, of course, as a principle. Then the data reported in rheumatoid arthritis, so the theory is that you are calming down the T cells that are causing an immune reaction. And so you're basically creating an immune suppressive environment with a PD-1 agonist.\n\n00:36:08,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's put it that way. So, of course, the data reported and lots of soul searching, lots of questions. But when we look at it from just without any position, obviously, we don't cover the stock either. It seems decent in terms of the 12-week data seems comparable to what we've seen.\n\n00:36:31,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n With current agents, particularly RINVOQ, it looks comparable. You have to also dissect out the patients who have already got experience. With prior drugs and current therapies, but the data looks comparable. And the thing that really confused people is what happened between week 12 and week 14 of the trial. Not really worth going into the detail here, but that was one where it caused a lot of soul searching amongst analysts and questions on the call. What is interesting, and I'm going to give one hypothesis for this and then stop. is that Lilly had a similar approach. They were and their data, when we compare the Anaptis data to the Lily data, looks quite similar. But Lilly decided to discontinue that product. Now. Is it because Lilly thought the profile of the drug, of their drug, was not good enough? Or was it simply because Lilly has a whole lot more— a lot more— strings to their bow than an aptus does, right?\n\n00:37:36,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n So you want to do obesity, you want to do Alzheimer's, you do oncology. Did you need this one too? Maybe it's one of those two. So time will tell, but I think the data was better than. Some folks were worried about.\n\n00:37:49,280 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, RA has been one of the more elusive I &I indications and still has a lot of unmet need and huge opportunity for those that become best in class in that category. But let's move to. The policy front, and really happy to welcome the longstanding Washington editor of BioCentury, Steve. And, Steve, you're going to have to tell me, is it Usden or Usden? But can you hear us and are you on stage?\n\n00:38:14,499 [SPEAKER_0]\n I can. And, you know, you can call me anything, just not late for dinner. Um, I say Austin but Great. I'm not particular.\n\n00:38:22,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, Steve, you know, you've followed obviously what's going on in Washington for a long time, but also. In the last several months with the new administration and written a lot about it. So our audience is always trying to keep on top of the industry. I mentioned earlier on this that you know we're probably near peak uncertainty. There's a lot of speculation. We can try to guess what is going to happen. We know some of the actions that Musk has taken with Doge efforts. But again, these new confirmations have not really been in place. We haven't really seen what they're going to do, other than the cuts. But maybe give us a high-level view as you see it as we sit here today with what's happening. You know, I think this audience is probably more interested in FDA, followed by NIH, followed by HHS, and broader kinds of applications.

Everything is uncertain. Right there's a lot of moving pieces. You know, high level, the way I look at it, there's pluses, there's negatives, or you could call it opportunities and risks. And then there's uncertainties, right? Opportunities. I think there's opportunities and companies are going to take advantage of them for policies that are going to advance onshore manufacturing. The United States of Pharmaceuticals, I think we'll see a lot of moves in the coming year for companies to um onshore a lot of pharmaceutical manufacturing. I think they're going to make fixes to the IRA Medicare drug negotiation program, not clear how far they'll go.\n\n00:40:10,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n PBM reform, the industry is likely to get immediate expensing of R&D costs restored.\n\n00:40:17,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n A return to traditional antitrust enforcement.\n\n00:40:21,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, legislation bipartisan legislation to restore pediatric priority review vouchers was introduced two days ago. I think that's likely to go forward. Negatives. You know, it's what you what you alluded to. There's there's going to be. Staffing cuts across government. FDA is not going to be completely immune from them. Doge has proposed really large cuts at FDA. Rfk jr has talked about cutting some of the scientific leadership also.\n\n00:40:53,150 [SPEAKER_0]\n We don't know how that's actually going to translate into action and how quickly it is. Over the long term. I think it's clear that that there's going to be an erosion. In staffing. And um you know they're for example the rules that for every um uh you can only hire one new person for every four people that leave. There's going to be a more or less aggressive return to office campaign, which is likely to drive some long-term FDA employees to leave. And then.\n\n00:41:26,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n There's just a tremendous amount of anxiety and lack of and poor morale at FDA right now about what's going to happen. We don't know. Maybe when Marty McCary comes in, he writes the ship. We'll see.\n\n00:41:37,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah.\n\n00:41:37,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, there's lots. Yeah.\n\n00:41:39,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, sir. Please go ahead. Continue.\n\n00:41:42,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um. So just really quick, a couple other things. You know, There's an enormous amount of anxiety at NIH about short and long-term policies. That could dramatically impact biomedical research. Obviously, they're the foundation for a lot of what the industry does.\n\n00:41:59,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, uncertainties, there's you know, there's opportunities for tremendous positive changes and reforms at FDA. Um and and there's there's likely to be some kind of commission that's going to be created to recommend reforms at FDA. That could be tremendously positive. There's also a chance of intentional and inadvertent policies. Got an FDA that really erode its ability to function even to meet PDUFA deadlines and it's credibility with the public. We don't know which way it's going to go. Another big uncertainty, and then I'll finish. We don't know whether Trump will revive the most favored nation international reference pricing policy proposal that he made in the first administration. RFK Jr. alluded to it during the confirmation hearings and, um, you know, I think that's kind of a and uncertainty that's going to be hanging out there for the whole administration.","char_start":39276,"char_end":43049,"start_time":"00:39:26","end_time":null}

They're very very astute kind of analysis, Steve, and it sounds like you're going to be kept busy over the next year. or more right with some of these really hot hot topics and you covered a bunch of them really well um what I'd like to drill down on with this audience and I also you know welcome your own and Sam to weigh in as you see fit But so I'm going to start with FDA, right? So FDA, I think that the greatest concern that, and I'll just speak for myself, but I think represents a portion of the audience, is that I don't need all these extra programmers or or other services. I mean, these are reviewers that are spending a lot of time with user fees paid for by the industry. To look at data and analyze it. And we all have dealt with the idea of meeting requests, getting written responses only, getting delays. You know, this is not an agency that's known to just have tremendous, I mean, we know and we interact with the FDA folks who are always working really hard, right?\n\n00:44:01,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um and that's not to say that there's not. A need for a hard look at potential reform, doing things differently. We've heard this coming out of the hierarchy for a while.\n\n00:44:22,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think we lost Chris Heron. Did you hear? Oh, good.\n\n00:44:24,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, yeah. I i i lost him. I was wondering if it was my on my end.\n\n00:44:29,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, no, Steve, I think we just lost Chris for a minute there. I'm sure he'll be back very soon. Steve, clearly, Chris is worried about the FDA situation. So how do you think that's going to, what is your best guess in terms of how that? Shakes out.\n\n00:44:45,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know we really don't know. Okay, so I think you know it's clear that FDA is going to experience cutbacks. It's not entirely clear where they're going to come right. So. If you had a 10% cutback in FDA staffing and they all came out of, for example, the tobacco center, then that wouldn't really impact the biopharmaceutical industry at all. If you have 10% of the review staff leaving, that would mean that you would start missing PDUFA deadlines and you would have really serious problems. I think one of the things to look at also is at the top. The the I think one of the key levers that Marty Makary is going to have and really be an indicator of where FDA is going to go going. forward is who's going to replace Patricia Cavazzoni as director of Cedar because the Cedar director really has more influence day to day on the things that are vital for the biopharmaceutical industry than the FDA commissioner does.\n\n00:45:47,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then just thinking about this. Go. in yours, I don't want to get political about this, but or force you to be political about it. If you think back to the times that you've been looking at the FDA, would you say that, in most of these, particularly the FDA, any of these public offices, that there is fat to be cut without really cutting into bone and muscle?\n\n00:46:13,217 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, but.\n\n00:46:15,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's very difficult when you're outside of an organization like that to make intelligent, um, comments about how it should be organized or whether there's fat or there isn't fat, um, you know. It's easy, here's, here's what I do know. Going in, and this would apply to any of the businesses for anybody who's on this call. If you were to go into a business and say, well, first, we're going to fire 10% of the people or 20% of the people, and then we're going to do an analysis to determine. um, you know, who's needed and if necessary we'll hire people back, you know. You would think well, that's kind of backwards, right? Like the first thing that you should do is go in and do a careful analysis and determine, um, who's needed, who's not needed, who might need to be in a different place or doing something different, and then you start acting. So. The problem, I think, is not whether determining whether or not there's fat at FDA that should be cut. It's weather you make that determination before you start cutting people. And that's the real concern.","char_start":42749,"char_end":47182,"start_time":"00:42:58","end_time":null}

The problem, I think, is not whether determining whether or not there's fat at FDA that should be cut. It's weather you make that determination before you start cutting people. And that's the real concern.\n\n00:47:14,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n You're on. Well, yeah, I dropped off. It sounds like you guys did hear the question, but FDA? But your own. Do you have follow up questions?\n\n00:47:21,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no. I was just gonna maybe make a comment and then steve. It's a question at the same time. I mean, look, if you if you go if if a board of directors forces the CEO to immediately tomorrow fire 10 of the company. The board still holds the CEO accountable for performance. When the president's going to force FDA to shed whatever number of people. Um, you know who's gonna— who's still gonna guarantee the performance of that agency?\n\n00:47:47,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's the problem.\n\n00:47:49,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I think that you can have a certain amount of confidence.\n\n00:47:54,589 [SPEAKER_0]\n In Marty Makary, we really don't know a lot about. What his intentions are and how he plans to run FDA. But I think we also can assume that he didn't. Go into this wanting to fail. And and he. He's going to learn really quickly and he's being told by insiders already that—um, you know— that there's that one of his important jobs is going to be to identify the people who need to be protected and to exert his influence to protect them. So I think that I think that McCary and I think others in the administration are going to feel a responsibility. Mean, ultimately, everybody in the country feels a responsibility to have to to make the FDA succeed. Um, so I think that if there are serious problems that occur, they will be inadvertent. It's not like some agencies where people are going in and saying, 'You know, this agency doesn't have an important mission and shouldn't exist.' I think it's more that that there's a tremendous scope. For example, first, people to be careless and to do things in an inadvertent way.\n\n00:49:00,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, that that have consequences. One of the problems with FDA and one of the concerns is that it takes, for example, it takes a very long time to train a reviewer. I've heard from people in FDA that they're really not productive. Until they've been there for two years, right? Um, so, if you get rid of people, and then you determine, well, we're missing PDUFA goals. We're having problems as a result of that. You can't turn that around immediately. It's going to take time and that's going to cause damage.\n\n00:49:31,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, there's also a lot of people at FDA, as we all know, do research. And the question—is that, are those people going to get targeted? And maybe not the reviewers. I don't know if you have an opinion.\n\n00:49:45,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n But then, secondly, you know, there's also a question: and Vivek brought a lot of these things out publicly, is the FDA too slow, too bureaucratic, too regimented in the way they review drugs? And so they released the bar on the efficacy side.\n\n00:50:03,749 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, so that's a two-part question. Are they too bureaucratic? Are they too slow? Absolutely, they could be faster. Absolutely, they could be better. I think most people at the FDA, many people that I know who were there, would acknowledge that and they have ideas and positive ideas about how the FDA could be improved. I think that.","char_start":46882,"char_end":50410,"start_time":"00:47:14","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_af75dee37a48_chunk_0013","doc_id":"doc_af75dee37a48","order":13,"text":". Are they too bureaucratic? Are they too slow? Absolutely, they could be faster. Absolutely, they could be better. I think most people at the FDA, many people that I know who were there, would acknowledge that and they have ideas and positive ideas about how the FDA could be improved. I think that.\n\n00:50:24,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think that. Uh, There's a real chance that McCarrion will get in there. And he will. Know ask people who are there who know actually how things work. You know, what are the top 10 ideas that they have, or top three ideas they have for improving the way that FDA functions. If they do that, he could be very successful. That was basically what Scott Gottlieb did when he got there. He asked the Senate directors and the staff for ideas, and then he promoted the ones that he thought were going to be the most effective. So there's a great opportunity if we want, we can talk about some of the low-hanging fruit. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit of things that could make the FDA more effective and better about the efficacy standard. The only thing that I would say is that, that I think has some real chance of happening, is around ultra-rare diseases. Patricia Cavazzoni has just recently left. Janet Woodcock. Um and others are really pushing hard to persuade Congress and to persuade the FDA to create a different standard for extremely rare diseases because the kind of paradigm around regulatory flexibility hasn't, um, you know, isn't working.\n\n00:51:32,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, yeah, let me add.\n\n00:51:34,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n This is a great conversation because I I do think there's a little bit of a paradox. I think this idea that the administration wants to really destroy inefficiency of the regulation. This is across the board, across, you know, agencies. And it does seem. That the ultimate goal is to make things easier, faster, more efficient to get drugs through. Maybe the safety bar goes up or even post-commercial commitments. But efficacy, it goes along with the right to try. I think the bipartisan support, as you just mentioned, Steve, on ultra-rare, but just pediatric review vouchers, there does seem to be a will. To get drugs to patients that need it more efficiently. But I think that and you're wrong, you mentioned this, like if a CEO is asked to fire 10% of their staff tomorrow. It's the timing, right? It's the idea that. That. is likely going to have unintended consequences. As opposed to, you know, we have a three-month goal or a six-month goal, right, to reduce it where you can actually go in and you have the trust and belief that they're going to keep the right people, that they're gonna really understand how to consolidate, how to improve processes.\n\n00:52:43,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n And by just cutting staff, I think you lose that opportunity. The other thing I'll say, yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead, Steve.\n\n00:52:49,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm sorry to interrupt really quickly. The real question about FDA is what is the goal? Because it's irrational to go in there and say, 'Well, the goal is to cut staff.' Especially since most of the drug review staff are paid for by industry user fees, so it's not as if cutting those staff is going to save the taxpayers' money.\n\n00:53:10,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that's where I think you have competing factions within the administration. You have some factions, Doge, for example, who they're met. For success is the number of people they can fire, okay? And then you're going to have other factions who are going to go in, and hopefully Marty Makary is going to be in this group, who are going to go in and say, 'No, the goal is to say, how can we get more safe and effective drugs to the American people? Um, in the most efficient way.' And it may not be that firing people is the answer, right? So there's going to be a tension between those factions. And there's an overall kind of ideology. And it's not just Doge. It's also coming from OMB that regulation is bad, that federal employees are bad, and that you have to do something to eliminate them. Whereas people who are in the biopharmaceutical industry obviously don't oppose strong regulation from FDA. They need that for the industry to thrive.","char_start":50110,"char_end":54315,"start_time":"00:50:24","end_time":null}

And I think there's going to be a tug of war. Um, and it's really unclear at this point who's going to win or if it's going to be some wins and some losses.\n\n00:54:28,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, let's pivot a little bit in the time we have left to NIH. And I'll start by saying this. I think many of us in the industry have 33 years in the industry and have been a little frustrated with the quality and the throughput that NIH puts out. We all agree that we need that government grant money. We need government research for basic research to fuel the biotech industry. I don't think anybody argues with that. But when you look at a $50 billion budget, and you look at some of the leading venture funds, for example, who do new technology startups. You know, that's a lot of capital being deployed for this early research and drug discovery. Yes, it's riskier. It's why the government should do that.\n\n00:55:13,910 [SPEAKER_3]\n versus more commercial private investors. So I think most people would say, 'Wow, I wish there was a better way to have almost like an industry partnership to drive and guide that use of dollars.' So I think most people would say, 'Wow, there is a lot of inefficiency there.' Yeah. Nobody likes to see research projects in the midstream get cut or stopped. You know, that's not fruitful. But. You know, I think we're just unsure what this looks like on the other side. Are there people and is, you know, um, uh, I know you uh highlighted an article that he published, but you know, any sense of what the mission is there, and is it, yes, we're going to cut the Yo. the fees, the administrative fees, but have they articulated a goal for what they want the NIH to ultimately deliver to our industry?\n\n00:56:09,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, um, it's it's still unclear, um, and you know, there's You could look at it. Again, threats and opportunities. If you look at the things that Bhattacharya has written over the years about NIH, he has had criticisms of the NIH that I personally agree with, and I think most people in this call would agree with that it's too risk-averse. That the age of people who receive first grants is too high. That too much of its research—um— is me too research and it isn't going in directions are going to lead to real innovation. So we're certainly not getting 50 billion dollars a year of science out of the 50 billion dollars a year so that we're paying for it. On the other hand, um, he has made a lot of statements about COVID-19. That are not based in science and that suggest that, uh, you know, that he may try to uh take steps to to You know, kind of reverse some of the most important work that FDA and that NIH does on infectious diseases and, as far as the relationship with industry, one of the things that he has said.\n\n00:57:22,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that RFK has said consistently is that they believe that there's too much influence of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n00:57:30,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Across public health agencies. Especially at FDA and at NIH. Um, So so that's, I think, that's a. That's it. You know, an issue of concern because obviously. The interface between NIH and industry. Is it essential what's the point of doing all of this research if it doesn't end up creating products that are going to advance the health of the American people? So there's a lot of angst at NIH. There's a lot of concern. That there are going to be moves that are going to be made that are going to um damage the ability of the NIH to fund cutting-edge research that it's going to disrupt it that there's going to be cutbacks in the amount of money that goes to NIH and um you know some of the immediate things that might happen impact would be disrupting relationships, research relationships, collaborations that industry has with NIH, with NIH-funded researchers. Perhaps it might change the ability of industry to get SBIR funding, which is really important for some of the small biotechs especially.","char_start":54015,"char_end":58424,"start_time":"00:54:11","end_time":null}

I know it's not directly related to Um, investments that people are making, but the concerns about what's likely to happen at CDC—I think um— are also warranted and it could have public health implications.\n\n00:59:00,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, although and correct me, but I saw Scott Goliath just did a shout out and was really supportive of the new director of pandemic planning is that correct?\n\n00:59:10,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, yeah, it's it's. You know, it's an interesting situation because there are some really competent, good people who are being recruited into the administration for some critical jobs. And then there are people who— you know, you really wouldn't want to see near the levers of power.\n\n00:59:30,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, so it's, yeah, it's complicated. Oh.\n\n00:59:34,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, well, I know. Look, I know you've also reported on the sentiment. We know that any time there's a change in administration, this is a bigger change because you've got— You know, you had a little bit of bipartisan support against kind of the new regime coming in. And so this really is more of a sea change. So I'm not surprised. That sentiment across these agencies is down. And it reminds me, I've done a lot of M &A and had to integrate folks. And you get two responses. You get the response like, 'No, we can't change. Everything is really good.' And you're going to ruin everything. And then those that are willing to step up and say, 'All right, what do you want to do?' And let me help. And those are the ones that we usually end up keeping. And the ones who end up leaving on their own or get dismissed are the ones who aren't willing to be part of that. Change regime for the better, right? There's a lot of good skill sets. So I just appreciate, Steve, that your reporting remains kind of objective and that you have that balance. View that you've shared here, and that, you know, we don't like to raise alarms before they're notable, but I think there are some concerns we all have with the FDA, the staff cuts, et cetera.\n\n01:00:42,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yaron, Sam, any final questions as we wrap here for Steve to close?\n\n01:00:50,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm all good. Maybe, Steve, a 10-second question, I guess, for you. A year from now?\n\n01:00:56,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Are we feeling better the same or a little bit more anxious about what happened in FDA?\n\n01:01:04,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think a year from now we'll either be feeling a lot better or a lot worse.\n\n01:01:09,569 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because that's about the timeframe when these things are going to play out. We really. Don't. We don't know it's it's it it could go.\n\n01:01:17,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n It could go really well, it could go really badly, but I think that's the right time frame to think about things. We'll have a good sense of things. And about that timeframe, we'll also know, within that time frame, for example, of a good idea what's going to happen with the user fee reauthorization is that going to go forward is it going to be revamped into something better or is it going to get blown up and cause real problems.\n\n01:01:39,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Excellent.

You're listening to Biotech Hangout, a live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry with a group of biotech insiders. I'm Brad Loncar and my co-hosts today are Eric Schmidt, hopefully, Tess Cameron, Tim Opler, Luba Greenwood, and our special guest, Adam Feuerstein.\n\n00:00:19,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. Um, Well, I'm sorry to say, I think this is going to be pick on the biotech sector day. Albert Burla was booed at an event at the White House yesterday. And I think that's kind of the tip of the iceberg of negative things that happened and just kind of the conversation about our sector this week. Um, we're going to kick things off with a really cool discussion about a story that I know everyone read. It was excellent that Adam wrote. It's that news about. zombie biotechs and how, when biotech companies crash out, oftentimes they think of creative ways to use their large cash piles that still exist. So Adam, I'm going to- kick it over to you again. Everyone I know read that story and it uh you know raised a lot of emotions and opinions on both sides uh just give us a brief summary and then let's jump into a discussion about Just this topic and how people feel about it.\n\n00:01:30,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, thanks, Brad. And thanks for having me on today.\n\n00:01:33,539 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's not a new topic, and it's something that I think we've all talked about probably in the past. Know and by biotech zombies uh you know and Eric Eric has used Eric has used the term as well. Others have used the term, but what we're talking about there are companies that trade at a negative enterprise value. So essentially, their assets are worth less. The equity in the company is worth less than the cash. That they have on the balance sheet, and oftentimes, uh, that situation arises when companies have, you know, you know, biotech, they have significant setbacks, right? Clinical trial, clinical setback, setbacks with their pipelines.\n\n00:02:15,629 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, it's just sort of indicative of kind of I think this overall issue that we just have. In biotech, you know, like I said, I track about 700.\n\n00:02:25,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n you know, give or take public biotech companies and about 200. of those trade at a negative EV in some form or another. uh, you know, so I guess that's the sort of army of zombies we are. that we are talking about.\n\n00:02:43,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n As you mentioned, you know, the question is sort of what to do with these companies and why they continue to exist and whether you know, those companies can turn themselves around or whether those companies, you know, the capital. the money that those companies have. Uh, should be you know either returned to shareholders or used in some more productive way.\n\n00:03:09,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, let's open the floor for people to just kind of jump in.\n\n00:03:13,799 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tell us what you think.\n\n00:03:17,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, well, maybe I'll jump in. I thought there were some really good discussions online, you know, on X about this. There was a good, you know, exchange, Daphne and John Maragonori and a few others where. How do you know when something is a zombie, right? So maybe, you know, maybe it looks dead on the outside.\n\n00:03:38,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n But can you always tell, right? Because we've seen some incredible kind of zombie transformations. We're like, 'Wow, that company.' You know, maybe it looked like a zombie for a while, but it really wasn't. And I thought it was, you know, great that John kind of mentioned.\n\n00:03:53,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n That, for Alnylam, and uh, you know, I'd be, I'd be interested. I mean, look, as uh As an investor, we are always looking to find companies that look like zombies but aren't, because those can create pretty interesting opportunities. They point to Tayshia, probably one of those where I think that company had been trading below cash for some time. And we, along with other investors, were able to see an opportunity with their gene therapy, you know, program for Rett syndrome. And, you know, voila, the company has, you know, reemerged and is back to life. So Adam or others, how do you know if something is a zombie? Or if it just looks like a zombie on the outside, but really has a lot of life in it?","char_start":0,"char_end":4457,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Or if it just looks like a zombie on the outside, but really has a lot of life in it?\n\n00:04:45,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n So Tessa, I love your perspective and I think that's a great question. And a lot of the times it's— It's actually sometimes very hard to tell, but I also think that many investors are just very quick today to write off companies that. If they actually looked hard enough and looked at the data, they are not really— you know— maybe they're zombie-esque, but they're not really quite there. And, you know, you're absolutely right. There are so many great comments from John and others. There's another one, an ex about. talking about look at jazz pharmaceuticals or pharma cyclics and your crime and Immunomedics and a number of other companies that you could have called zombie at the time, but have done very, very well. And of course, these are just some, and one could argue, well, that's good that you're calling out 10 companies, but. What about 100 of the other ones? I do have to say, being on boards and investor in some of these companies that one may call zombies, I mean, one of the things that these companies do is they are forced to truly focus and have a hyper focus and hyper focus plus survival and working very hard.\n\n00:06:07,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n And so what you have is the team that's usually left standing in many of these so-called zombie companies are really determined and they do miracles. And they also focus just on one program, not on two, three or four. So I think that a combination of very strong teams that are remaining, plus hopefully there are some investors, Tesla IQ, it's great to hear that you're working on that and picking out some of these companies and putting some money into them so that they can come out stronger than they even would have.\n\n00:06:41,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Otherwise.\n\n00:06:42,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I expected a defense of zombies. Coming on this call just given the people that you know, given you guys' backgrounds, um, and I, and I think yes, you can point to companies.\n\n00:06:54,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, that are exceptions and that, you know, are not our not really zombies or just temporary zombies, whatever term you want to use. I think some of the ones you raised, I wouldn't put those in those categories, for instance.\n\n00:07:10,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n Immunomaniacs, I wouldn't put in that category. I don't think that they were a zombie. I think, you know, that was, that was. Actually, a case of an activist investor coming in and throwing out an incompetent management team because they knew that the drug was working. I think that's not a zombie example.\n\n00:07:27,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I think, again, I think. These are some hard things that I think that the industry has to grapple with.\n\n00:07:34,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n That, when you look in the aggregate, there is a lot of money that is wasted, whether that's because of arrogance, because of greed, because of people who don't want to give up their positions, who think that they know better. You know, the example that I used in my column this week, cargo therapeutics. You know that. As you know. No fault of that company. No one is saying that the company shouldn't have been formed in the first place. There was strong scientific rationale. It had very sophisticated investors who backed that company, but they backed it for a very specific reason. And that experiment was run and the experiment failed. And. I'm not the only one saying that cargo should be shut down. I talked to the many of the company's largest shareholders and they want the company to be shut down because they said this is what we this is what we funded it didn't work. And we're not interested in whatever else they're going to be doing. So I just think that, you know, yes, I'm sympathetic and I understand that there are.\n\n00:08:36,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n You can pull out examples, but I think in the aggregate, the industry has a problem with a lot of these companies.\n\n00:08:43,049 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Adam, I think there, like anything else, there's a whole degree of.\n\n00:08:48,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n you know, how much this kind of irks people and based off of how hard of a pivot. you know, companies are going for, you know, you have the.","char_start":4159,"char_end":8612,"start_time":"00:04:45","end_time":null}

Right. But also on like a more legitimate scale, you know, you brought up Galapagos, which, you know, has to be a record for the largest negative enterprise value ever.\n\n00:09:18,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n When their first deal, I have the highest respect for Paul Stoffels, but the first deal that he did was a CAR-T deal. The investors in that company really hated that deal.\n\n00:09:32,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n Totally different area than what the company had been founded on and worked on forever through like the Gilead transaction. And I think that's. really the cases that you know get people fired up about this. It's like I invested in you to do this, and now you've taken your investment dollars, which, for large investors, can't be easy to get out of. And now you're doing something that I'm totally not interested in.\n\n00:10:02,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. And there are ways, like I said, it's not just about shutting the company down. I mean, look, you can, you know, you can find a merger partner in the case of Galapagos. Now, I haven't really followed all the details. Lately, but you know, the spin co that they're doing, I mean, there are other ways of sort of unlocking shareholder value in some of these companies, you know, Part of the problem, I think, is that we just have so many redundancies. We have so many companies who are trying to do sort of the same thing similarly and doing them badly. That uh, you I know it's incredibly difficult to do, but you can think of a situation where maybe there are assets from several different companies that can be rolled up together. And I know it's easy. To say that it's much more difficult to do those kinds of things. But I think we, you know, it gets to the broader idea that we need some consolidation, I think, at least on the public side.\n\n00:10:56,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n So Adam, maybe just sharing something that builds on that and Tim's ears are going to burn here because this is something that we talked about a lot. This whole idea of like, you know, because you bring it up with, you know, with cargo, this whole idea of like an investor mandate, right? Like, do you have like? That money, when it goes to the company, it's not like.\n\n00:11:19,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, that is all the company's money and just purely theirs to decide what to do with. I mean, you know, technically I guess it is their decision, but. You know, it's really like that money came from investors, right? And so do you have? A mandate from your investors to like do what you should be doing. And sometimes you get companies that are like, you know, they're below cash, but like their investors like still love what they're doing. Right and we'll talk about solid biosciences in a bit. But they were trading below cash for you know a fair amount of time. Yeah, like we were still holders, right? And like a lot of their other investors were still holders, and we liked what they were doing. So what's a way to like test if you have that investor mandate? And, you know, Tim. And, you know, Peter—uh, you know, and I had had brainstormed about this before, and Tim had some really great thoughts on this. Where it's like, hey, what if you do something where you basically say, look, you know, what we wanted to do didn't work. And so, look, you can either get like.\n\n00:12:20,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Your shares back or you can be on you know your your money back right and uh you know we'll give you x dollars per share or you can stay us you know stay with us on this next journey to do Whatever. right and investors can kind of like walk with their feet or not right and those who stay get a larger stake of whatever that next journey is. And we see this with some of the reverse mergers where what I love that some reverse merge companies are doing now. If you have the shell, that's basically saying like. Hey, you know, existing holders of the shell, like. You can get a dividend or your shares bought back or something like that. And the new investors are functionally the people putting in the pipe.","char_start":8312,"char_end":12769,"start_time":"00:08:43","end_time":null}

You want your investors to choose you, not kind of. Uh, you know, force yourself—uh, you know, on—uh, you know, on them. So, um, you know, just a thought and something that that we talked about.\n\n00:13:23,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think that I totally agree with you. I think that that you know, those kind of those those those sorts of uh solutions. Certainly work. I mean, I'd love to hear Tim's take. I think Tim's around on this call. Tim, you have a take on this?\n\n00:13:35,920 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, I mean, Adam. If anything, I'm. even more sympathetic.\n\n00:13:41,170 [SPEAKER_5]\n to the kind of the cause of the shareholder than you are.\n\n00:13:45,470 [SPEAKER_5]\n Companies definitely don't spend enough time thinking about their shareholders, and there's obvious agency reasons for that.\n\n00:13:54,210 [SPEAKER_5]\n And, you know, I'll tell some stories. 20 years ago, I was advising royalty farmers.\n\n00:14:00,000 [SPEAKER_5]\n There was a huge battle on their board. Like half the board thought the idea of buying pharmaceutical royalties was stupid and they shouldn't continue to do that; they should just cash out and return the cash.\n\n00:14:12,980 [SPEAKER_5]\n The other half didn't. So, us advisors came up with a structure where people could choose to stay in or not. And like half of them cashed out. And I mean, talk about a mistake, right? I mean, that company's value went up like a hundredfold from. At that point, it was a great idea to buy pharmaceutical. royalties. um On the other hand, In the last couple of years, you know, every time I push this idea and test you and Peter and I spent a lot of time talking about this. In fact, I pitched it to like. are a capital companies and like you and peter were fine but you have colleagues who are like the weeds on individual companies, it's very hard for them.\n\n00:14:51,860 [SPEAKER_5]\n to say hey we want to return cash. because it's so hard to get cash. and I have been completely unsuccessful.\n\n00:15:01,120 [SPEAKER_5]\n in getting a company.\n\n00:15:03,060 [SPEAKER_5]\n in the last two or three years to voluntarily agree to return cash to shareholders. They will do it with a gun to their head. um And. I almost wonder if, like when we found these biotech companies, if we should almost create incentives for management.\n\n00:15:19,890 [SPEAKER_5]\n We're like, if you give the money back, you're going to get a big bonus or something.\n\n00:15:24,690 [SPEAKER_5]\n Basically, if you give your money back, there's less money around too. pay management. And no one wants to talk about that.\n\n00:15:33,220 [SPEAKER_5]\n um but you know, agency factors are very important in actual real-world behavior.\n\n00:15:43,189 [SPEAKER_2]\n right. well, adam, awesome piece. we could talk about this literally for the whole hour. and i know people will continue to talk about it over twitter. so thanks a lot. and you're going to stay and join us for some news items. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to start with you. So Stoke.\n\n00:16:02,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Signed a rest of world deal with Biogen on their Dravet program. Tell us about that.\n\n00:16:10,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so that deal, what was it? I lose track of time.

There was obviously not a recognition that they needed to raise money to fund the phase three study, and um, it was one of the reasons why this talk had been depressed, kind of going into this, and so they did raise the money. You know, it's a non-dilutive way to to raise money, selling off, you know, a portion of the drug, uh, rights commercial rights. They kept the North American rights, U. S. rights.\n\n00:17:13,859 [SPEAKER_1]\n We can debate whether or not that was a good deal or not. I thought it was, but, like I said, I also talked to some people who thought that it wasn't the idea that this is now an encumbered asset.\n\n00:17:25,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n That, uh, you know, that essentially, you know, kind of dead money or, you know, kind of a company that's now just sort of like now has to go through the paces of running the study, which will take at least a couple of years.\n\n00:17:37,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n And of course, they were also on a lot of people, I think yours included, a lot of people's buyout list. So whenever you sign a partnership rather than getting acquired though those types of investors you know sell and move on so they're probably was a lot of that too.\n\n00:17:57,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, let's move on. Tess, I'm going to go over to you. So we had some Duchenne news. So Solid seems to be like— you know, the company on Sarepta's heels in terms of the micro dystrophin gene therapies. I know that RA is an investor in Solid, but tell us about their data.\n\n00:18:20,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n It had a very positive market reaction.\n\n00:18:23,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, absolutely. So thanks, Brad. So this is a company with a pretty long history. They were founded back in 2014 to develop a gene therapy for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. And they have seen a lot of ups and downs. So they are one of the—you know, they were certainly trading like a zombie company, you know, for a while. And they released data earlier this week from a small number of patients, just three patients, who'd been dosed with their gene therapy.\n\n00:18:53,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, what they showed is average micro dystrophin expression of about 110%, which is pretty remarkable. So when you look at that, compared to you know, Sarepta's gene therapy, I think, you know, they show around 34%.\n\n00:19:11,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n So high micro dystrophin expression, I think Pfizer was upwards of 34%. Pfizer was discontinued for safety reasons. I think they might have been closer to 50. So high micro dystrophin expression, and then. One of the things that was really interesting is that they also showed some data that suggested it's obviously still early, but just showed the potential for some kind of cardiac benefits. They looked at LVEF for their three patients as well.\n\n00:19:43,399 [SPEAKER_3]\n So, you know, this was certainly, you know, I think a positive update for them.\n\n00:19:49,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n And the next step from, you know, and what they're doing is really talking with the FDA mid-year about, you know, next steps and the potential for accelerated approval.\n\n00:20:01,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, so this actually brings us, there's another angle to this story that brings us to, I think, another state and mechanics of biotech discussion.\n\n00:20:13,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I went over there on Tuesday and I interviewed Bo Cumbo about this news. And before I did, I put a shout out on Twitter saying I was going over there and did anybody. Have any questions? And there was an overwhelming response regarding the way that Solid raised money off of this news.","char_start":15914,"char_end":20195,"start_time":"00:16:10","end_time":null}

And there was an overwhelming response regarding the way that Solid raised money off of this news.\n\n00:20:36,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n It was one of these, and we've talked about this before, and I know Adam has written about this before. It is one of these situations where they announced the news on Tuesday, but in the days leading up to announcing this news, they confidentially got together with bankers and like a handful of institutional investors and locked in arrays before even putting this data out there publicly. So I think they raised $200 million. At four dollars a share, um, and I asked the CEO Beau about this, and he had a very thoughtful response. His response was that, look, Biotech has been terrible lately, especially in the gene therapy space. And you can't count on a good stock reaction sometimes, even when you have good news lately. And so he felt given. The position that they were in— locking that in with those institutional investors beforehand—was the right thing to do.\n\n00:21:39,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I think that that's a fair argument. But I would also say that there's two counter arguments. Number one, they. You could argue that those institutions have a vested interest in getting the lowest price possible and so might not be.\n\n00:21:58,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Their feedback on the data might not be what the actual overall market feedback was and you might be leaving money on the table. For example, the stock has traded north of six. I think it's in the mid-fives right now.\n\n00:22:13,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n They diluted a lot at four and maybe could have done that at five or six or seven. But I think the bigger issue, at least that I'm interested in, is. Our industry is the only industry that does raises like this regularly.\n\n00:22:30,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n A lot of generalist and retail investors have, I think, valid concerns about the fairness of our industry. And so, a lot of people are saying.\n\n00:22:43,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, why did somebody else get an early look at this data and why did, were they able to invest at such a low price when I don't have that same opportunity.\n\n00:22:55,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think there's a valid argument on that side too.\n\n00:23:00,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, put this topic out for discussion too because I think it's another thing that, you know, is an important issue about, like, what it means to invest in biotech.\n\n00:23:13,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n Who wants to start first?\n\n00:23:16,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'll share some thoughts with, I think, obviously, as you shared, Brad, we were certainly investors in the follow-on that they did. After data. You know, I think Beau raises a really good point. Um, where What is the market reaction going to be to data? What are key things to present and share when you're doing a data release? Sometimes that's not really clear, right? And I think in particular, in the market environment that we're in. You know, where you know that you have a data release, you certainly want to be able to raise money to get to that next stage. That investor feedback can be really helpful to enable the, you know, to enable the raise. I think, you know, also importantly.\n\n00:24:07,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n It's kind of important to know that for Solid, they did share the data and then they actually, you know, they did the pricing. They did the pricing later, right? So there was some time for the market to kind of see those data.\n\n00:24:28,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n But you know, importantly, it's always a demand and supply question. So they had to raise also a very large amount of money. And they had a number of investors who they were talking with. And I think an important thing to remember about investors is we're very, very competitive with each other, right? And what's the way to outbid other investors? It is paying a higher price, right?","char_start":19895,"char_end":23924,"start_time":"00:20:36","end_time":null}

It is paying a higher price, right?\n\n00:24:59,519 [SPEAKER_3]\n And investors are always able to do that. And when there is a lot of demand, I mean, that is what you see— is you just see investors bidding up, you know, bidding up the stock. That's what we see in the market every day. And I think that the price reaction that we see— you know, in the aftermath of that follow-on— as well is really a reflection of the company being in a position where they have good data and they're also well-funded, right? But I think that dynamic is a really important one to remember: yes, sure, every investor would like the lowest price, but also you are constantly being tested on what is the price that you are willing to pay because you can always get outbid. And that dynamic is ever present. And, you know, indeed. We see that continuing to happen on financings on a pretty regular basis.\n\n00:25:58,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n Adam, this raise was very similar to a pipe. I know that you see the kind of retail Twitter comments whenever we see a situation like this, when there's data in a pipe. What's your take?\n\n00:26:10,699 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think it's. It. think part of this reflects just the sort of uneven playing field right now in terms of the finance you know capital markets where companies as I said you know companies have to raise money. They are sort of at a disadvantage because it's difficult to raise money. So they are sort of at the mercy of the of investors and funds. And so, you know, I like a lot of these deals. And I mean, I think maybe Tess can speak to this. I mean, I wonder, like, how much like when R. A. goes out to want to build positions in the company like. How much are you building a position in a company in the open market versus going to a company and saying, 'Hey, we'll give you $100 million, but we needed, we wanted a discount.' Like, you know, you go in and you basically set, you know, you put a demand, a term sheet on the desk and say, 'Take it or leave it.' I think we're seeing a lot more of that. And the sort of the pipes are kind of, you know, sort of, that's kind of what the pipes are. Are doing right. I mean, these you're not going out and just like buying the open market.\n\n00:27:13,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, you're going in, kind of, you know, you're going into these companies and saying, you know, I look and there's some benefits to the companies as well. I mean, companies want— they want goods. They want a good, stable of shareholders. So I'm not saying it's all, you know, it's all it's not all one-sided, but it is sort of indicative of kind of where the market is right now.\n\n00:27:33,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. Yeah, maybe just two other points to add on to that. One is it is actually very difficult to build a meaningful position on the open market in many biotechs simply because of volume, right? That there's very limited volume. So that's kind of point one, which is. Often, for an institutional investor to build a meaningful position, that does require refinancing. Um and then you know, point number two is—I think Adam, what you say about uh you know, pipes—uh you know, gee, it would be nice if it were that way. But again, there's always the risk of being outcompeted by peers, right? And that is what creates pricing tension.\n\n00:28:15,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh you know, allows companies to um you know, really you know, really kind of bid things up right, so I think, as an investor, you always have to be careful when you're going to a company and saying, 'Hey, here's what we can pay.' Right. Well, what if you have a peer who's coming in tomorrow and saying, 'I can pay that and I can, you know, throw on another 10%.' You better have been really true about what you said your pricing sensitivity was originally. Um, And so I think that pricing tension really continues to uh you know really continues to exist uh you know for companies.","char_start":23624,"char_end":27795,"start_time":"00:24:59","end_time":null}

Um, And so I think that pricing tension really continues to uh you know really continues to exist uh you know for companies.\n\n00:28:55,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n And while I would say investors are certainly in a position where there's a lot of companies that are just trading at very discounted values. We're still very much in competition with each other, which companies should always just think about as they're thinking about these different financings. You continue to see a lot of companies who are just testing that and saying, 'Look, I'm going to put data out, I'm going to see how the market reacts, and I'm going to use that to raise money.' And you may have other companies, particularly, I think, when data is, you know, maybe a little bit messier. Where they might see some benefit to testing that a little bit beforehand. To understand even if there is a path forward, right? Because, uh, you know, for many companies, they may be in a position where they're saying, 'I could raise money off of these three patients but like, what if that's not a good idea? And investors aren't excited, and they should really wait until they have 10 or something like that. I think that's where some of these discussions can be very helpful for companies is making that decision.\n\n00:30:00,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Tim, what's your banking perspective on this? And of course, again, like every issue, there's a whole spectrum of how these look. You know, on the pipe. Um, variety— we've even seen some where those institutional investors have been given blinded data that nobody else sees, like you know, weeks or months ahead of like a big you know, data or medical meeting announcement. I think those, you know, really bother a lot of retail investors. How do you feel about, from a banking perspective?\n\n00:30:34,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n How needed these things are to get these deals done.\n\n00:30:38,410 [SPEAKER_5]\n I mean, I think Tessa's comments should be taken seriously. And what I mean by that is: We are in a free market, right? So the company is going to do what's in their self-interest. The investor is going to do what's in their self-interest. And yet they choose to do these types of transactions. And there's a reason. Which is: retail investors can't come in and look at four data points or whatever at some biotech company. Figure out what to do, but they sure love to jump in once RA gets a crack at it, right? And so, if you think of, like, the IPO market is oftentimes IPOs are underpriced and sort of jump on the first day. These pipe discounts are kind of the same thing where you're essentially inducing the investor to come in and do the work and participate in the deal. And I mean, Tess, your points about the competition are just right on. Yeah, it's highly competitive. And we see that on the banking side all the time. What's so funny is you'll have a company like, there's no interest, right? Like no one wants to put in money into XYZ company.\n\n00:31:39,580 [SPEAKER_5]\n You know, you're out as the banker knocking on doors. No one wants to listen to you. You can call your friends like Tess. Hey, Tess, should you look at this? Like, you know, Tim, I love you, but. We don't love that company. Sorry. And then.\n\n00:31:50,310 [SPEAKER_5]\n All of a sudden, one party's in, and then pretty soon you got like 50 people that want to jump in. So it's a very interesting dynamic. And I do think that there's a method to what appears to be a bit of madness.\n\n00:32:02,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, let's move on. We had some sad news this morning. Bluebird is doing a take-private acquisition. Adam, tell us. about some of the details and your thoughts on that.\n\n00:32:16,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, uh, so uh bluebird is going to sell itself or is selling itself to a couple of private equity firms. I think the deal, you know, minus the CVR which they have, I think it's about 30 million deal.\n\n00:32:32,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Not. Very surprising, to be honest, just given the financial difficulty, because I'm sure you guys have talked about.\n\n00:32:39,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Bluebird and the gene therapy situation there, probably on the Hangout in the past, but we've certainly addressed it at STAT and on our podcast.","char_start":27495,"char_end":31882,"start_time":"00:28:55","end_time":null}

They were sort of proving that gene therapy, at least from a scientific basis, was something that was possible and that could cure patients of these horrible diseases, in their case, sickle cell and beta thalassemia.\n\n00:34:01,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Ultimately, you know, they sort of ran into the buzzsaw of just the business case and how do you turn these breakthrough scientific achievements—um— that you know that everyone is proud of—uh— and everyone points to as the reason kind of to be in biotech—um— but how do you make how do you turn that into a successful business venture and you know it turns out that it's very difficult I see Eric has joined us.\n\n00:34:30,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Eric, you've covered this company for many years. What do you think will- be the story of Bluebird at the end of the day?\n\n00:34:41,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, unfortunately, this isn't the ending that any of us would have liked. And as Adam just articulately laid out, yeah, it's been a long, slow decline that nobody should be surprised about in terms of the unhappy ending today. But there is one silver lining, which is that Bluebird's products are going to, I think, persist under new hands and ownership, of course. But at least persist for those patients with CCA-LD, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease who sorely do need these options. There aren't that many patients that maybe Bluebird can serve in the future.\n\n00:35:16,950 [SPEAKER_4]\n Of course you know, many of us, including Adam myself, have written about our skepticism toward the the margin structure, the business opportunity, the profitability. These drugs, so we'll see if they can do any better in other people's hands, but at least for the time being, the products will be out there and available to those who so choose.\n\n00:35:37,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I think, partly, you know, when I look at Bluebird, too, and Eric, you know, this well. Um, you know, partly, it's the problem there is just kind of this fundamental like— can you you mentioned, just the business case to be made for this particular kind of product. But, you know, if you look, if you dig in, sort of more granularly into Bluebird, you know, they, you know, they did, they made a lot of mistakes. You know, things that, if you look back, uh, you know, they had some, you know, they had sort of some scientific hiccups and setbacks back if you go back to, like, 2015, you know, with their first construct, you know, which kind of ran into some trouble and they had to do, you know, they essentially had to do, a lot more, a lot more work, to kind of figure out how to get this thing to be effective. You know, and they had manufacturing. There were things that were sort of specific to Bluebird. You know, they, you know, one of the big things that they did, you know, they just spent, Eric, you remember, they just spent so much money.\n\n00:36:32,819 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, even when people were saying to me, why, you know, why are you spending so much money? And they just they did. And and I think there was this resistance.","char_start":31582,"char_end":35873,"start_time":"00:32:39","end_time":null}

And they just they did. And and I think there was this resistance.\n\n00:36:42,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n on the part of management there that, you know, they just, they believed in the mission and they didn't, you know, they didn't kind of heed the call of investors saying, you know, maybe throttle back. And so all those sorts of things, kind of, contributed to the demise of the company, you know, on top of just this difficulty of making gene therapy work as a business.\n\n00:37:01,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, there's another angle to this story I've never heard anyone mention that's something we talk about a lot lately. I think is interesting to note too is I actually think this is one of the first companies ever, in part, to be wiped out by Chinese competition. I remember very well ASCO 2015.\n\n00:37:22,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n Everyone waiting with bated breath for Bluebird to um present their BCMA data and the announcement came out and at the same time it was like, Hey, there's some China and company working on the same thing. And like, nobody knew that. And today the Chinese company is worth 7 billion. and bluebird is essentially going bankrupt, and if that chinese company didn't exist, bluebird would own the bcma market right now and probably be worth seven or eight billion. and um I think that's really like historically the first example of that actually happening. so i think that's interesting too.\n\n00:38:02,320 [SPEAKER_5]\n and brad, just to jump in on that. if there's one thing we should all be learning in western biotech, it's that one could probably be a little bit more efficient about how you run a biotech. exactly. and i remember talking to bluebird management over the years. and there was just such confidence that they were doing the right thing. And they're all great people. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them. But they were just very confident that they had it figured out. And they didn't. And you know, there's one thing that I think could be very disruptive.\n\n00:38:42,750 [SPEAKER_5]\n Is for biotech companies to start to compete on efficiency.\n\n00:38:49,540 [SPEAKER_5]\n And, you know, Tess, I know like at RA, you kind of preach this a little bit, right?\n\n00:38:54,200 [SPEAKER_5]\n Why don't we try starting the next Bluebird with 15 people and see if we can. Do that. Um, Because I actually think you could do it. And it could be a much better business model and a way to out-compete the Chinese.\n\n00:39:10,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that's a very good point. And lastly on this, I I don't want to get into this, but in the spirit of picking on like biotech model today, I thought Angelica Peebles, the CNBC biopharma reporter, brought up another thing that really irks people, which is that the CEO of this company over time cashed out like $80 million. And and over the course of the company really never succeeded over the long term.\n\n00:39:42,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's a free market, but that also bothers a lot of people. Lastly, one other negative item in the news, and then we're going to go to greener pastures. Tim Saterna, which was an IPO just, I think, in November, it's very similar to the cargo story, has already crashed and burned and I think reminded people of the risk uh of the biotech sector is there anything any learnings from this one I mean, I don't think Saturna did anything wrong, right?\n\n00:40:18,560 [SPEAKER_5]\n That they discovered that they had a significant bilirubin side effect with one of their drugs.","char_start":35573,"char_end":39282,"start_time":"00:36:32","end_time":null}

Thank you. But, you know, this one, this is, you know, I'd say a growing list of companies that, you know, shortly after IPO has seen some kind of talks. Right. And it just reminds us, like, my gosh, like, small molecule drug development is really hard. And until you see it in the clinic, there's a lot that you don't know. Um, I think what's interesting and what Saturna highlighted in their PR is that they've got—uh, you know, multiple, multiple attractive PTH1R agonists— is what they said that they're planning to accelerate. And they're planning to get one into the clinic, targeting later this year. And it just reminds us. The importance of having backups right and I I remember um when I was working with uh you know carl de chico back at foghorn him uh you know really preaching that and reminding us you know eloquence was you know, gosh, it's like how many drugs had to fail before, you know, Eliquis, which was like the\n\n00:41:33,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n backup of the backup of the backup.\n\n00:41:35,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, actually made it into clinical trials and, you know, made it to market.\n\n00:41:41,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that just a reminder of how important it is to. You know, we talk about efficiency, right? But efficiency.\n\n00:41:50,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n shouldn't come at the expense of good risk mitigation strategies for valuable targets.\n\n00:41:57,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n So the other problem here, as Tim and Tess both mentioned, is that this is a recent IPO, and this is unfortunately at least the second, maybe even third IPO to have blown up. In the last you know six months since going public, and that that just really wears on biotech more broadly than even the relevance to the few investors who might have owned this security. And it casts a pall over the industry when you have companies that are so fresh and new.\n\n00:42:25,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n Losing money this early. I just want to chime in here. The sentiment out there is terrible right now in biotech, probably a lot worse than the XBI stock performance or anything else you might be reading about in the papers. And it's because of these types of transactions that just go south so soon.\n\n00:42:44,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Course people are crowding into the same set of names and seemingly you know, losing money hand over fist on a daily basis. So it's hard out there. You know, our clients are hurting, I'm sure. Others on the call are hurting too.\n\n00:42:57,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n We got to be doing something different in terms of our investment strategy. I'm not sure we're on the right path right now.\n\n00:43:03,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right. Well, we have a lot still to cover. I'm going to try to go through some of these quickly. And let's talk about happier things, of course.\n\n00:43:12,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tim, Springworks has been in the news. So German Merck, Merck KGAA, is in talks to potentially acquire them. And at this point, that's not a rumor. The companies have confirmed it in the media, but it does seem to be taking a lot longer than people may be expected.\n\n00:43:32,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Springworks had earnings yesterday and they put the earnings out, but didn't have a call or anything. So, you know, I think that says something.\n\n00:43:41,640 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tell us anything you can about that. And just overall M&A sentiment. I saw a headline in the news like a day or two ago that said that. The Trump FTC might not actually dial back the you know, the pressure on big mergers, like people were thinking, what are you hearing in terms of all of that?\n\n00:44:03,800 [SPEAKER_5]\n I mean, just to comment on SpringWorks. First of all, I don't have any specific information. If I did, I couldn't comment on it. But what I can say is, interestingly, in my PhD dissertation, I looked at the following question: if there's a credible announcement of a merger. That is. Such and such companies and talk. So this is like credible. It's not some rumor that was in some social media.","char_start":38982,"char_end":43470,"start_time":"00:40:18","end_time":null}

But what I can say is, interestingly, in my PhD dissertation, I looked at the following question: if there's a credible announcement of a merger. That is. Such and such companies and talk. So this is like credible. It's not some rumor that was in some social media.\n\n00:44:26,940 [SPEAKER_5]\n What happens to the stock next? What I found was, and I looked at about 150 of these over the years. Um, About half the time, the merger happens, and this stock goes up. And about half the time the merger doesn't happen and of course the stock goes down. So you saw Spring work pop up, which is the right thing. But if you were like a merger arb and you wanted to ask the question, could you make money by buying Springworks right now? The answer would be: there should be no profit opportunity. So I don't know what's going to happen with Merck KGA. Springworks is really going to—obviously, Merck KGA has made an offer. So now it's going to be up to the bankers for SpringWorks and the board for SpringWorks. Is this offer good enough? Or are they better off continuing to operate?\n\n00:45:11,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n For all.\n\n00:45:11,610 [SPEAKER_5]\n They have to figure that out. How much time is it going to take for people to see the announcement? They're like, 'OK, this is going to happen tomorrow.' It usually takes two to four months. And the reason is that The bankers are probably going to keep shopping SpringWorks to make sure that they have the best and highest offer. And they're going to torture Merck KGA, who's unfortunately now out exposed saying, 'Hey, we want to buy this company right so they're gonna be asked a question like, 'Hey, how come you didn't if they fail to?'\n\n00:45:42,329 [SPEAKER_5]\n And so the bankers are going to use the leverage that they've got.\n\n00:45:45,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hey, Tim, I don't know if you know this from a disclosure standpoint.\n\n00:45:50,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Merck had to come out and kind of acknowledge.\n\n00:45:55,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n That there was this uh, you know, there was this interest in the company that correct from. I guess it's like some German securities is there, like if if a deal if the deal let's say the deal falls apart, let's just say, like they can't reach terms, and and and Merc decides to walk away. Do they also have to disclose that? Do you know how that works?\n\n00:46:13,430 [SPEAKER_5]\n I don't think they do. We have the same rules in the UK. Like if you're AstraZeneca and you receive a big offer from Pfizer, you can't just sit on it and not tell investors about it. And it's so restrictive over there because of this thing called the code. You've got to actually be really careful with your advisor about making a merger overture because you don't want to trigger the code. Um so I would assume that Merkeji AA. could just go on their merry. merry way.\n\n00:46:47,190 [SPEAKER_5]\n There's going to be incredible pressure on the board of SpringWorks right now. Right. So it's out in the open.\n\n00:46:53,870 [SPEAKER_5]\n And uh, you know, whoever their bankers are, they're you know working day and night too—see if they can get it. An alternative offer. And I would think that there are multiple bidders in the picture, just because SpringWorks is an attractive company. It's fair to point out that you know, Ringworks' assets are probably not going to get picked up by a large. and that's because large pharma are in general focused on big indications in oncology and SpringWorks is going after mid-size and smaller indications.\n\n00:47:27,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, let's keep moving on. Tess, I'm going to go over to you. So M&A is something that we would love to have as a spark to the biotech sector. And another thing we watched closely— especially in the middle of earnings— is how drug launches are going.\n\n00:47:45,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n A really high profile one is BridgeBio with the Truby. And of course, Alnylam might be in the space as soon as next month too. Seems to be going okay, right?","char_start":43170,"char_end":47171,"start_time":"00:44:26","end_time":null}

This was a launch that I think had a lot of a lot of eyes on it. I think there were a lot of people who were pretty skeptical about another, you know, a small molecule for, you know, ATTR cardiomyopathy. And Bridge Bio really, you know, really impressed, you know, having over a thousand, you know, unique prescriptions since, you know, FDA approval, which was, you know, which was really recent, right? So they've just been on the market for really a couple months at this point. And I think this speaks to a broader trend, you know, companies being able to commercialize on their own, right? And that's something that's, you know, traditionally been really hard. And there's been this like short-term, kind of, launch. You know, philosophy around, you know, smaller biotechs, but we're seeing some real, you know, we're seeing some real successes and, you know, probably a little bit too early to call that completely for BridgeBio, but certainly, you know, certainly looking, you know, looking very strong out of the gate.\n\n00:49:07,330 [SPEAKER_5]\n And Brad, I want to jump in on your question on M &A. You asked me the same question like a politician. I just didn't answer it. So, so M &A, we think, is going to be pretty strong. I saw the point on the FTC. I think that's going to be okay for most of what we worry about. But. One thing we were recently looking at at Steeple was how many of these launches are going well? And we saw the same thing Tess just said, which is there's a lot of launches that are going well. And what we noticed is that in almost every case, company that has a good launch gets spotted. That was very striking.\n\n00:49:43,430 [SPEAKER_5]\n You know, try to list out the companies that you know that had launches that beat consensus, and that didn't get bought. Not many. There are some, but not a lot.\n\n00:49:54,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right.\n\n00:49:56,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right. Let's keep going. And you can't have a call without talking about obesity. Eric, I'm going to go over to you.\n\n00:50:06,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n Adam's colleague, Ling Chen at STAT, wrote a really great piece on the obesity space.\n\n00:50:13,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n Her point was, from a patient perspective, not everybody is looking for overly dramatic.\n\n00:50:22,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, percent of, of weight loss. And I've always felt strongly the same thing. Like now, like whenever we have new data, everyone zeros in on the weight loss percent, but. I think there are other factors like tolerability that are a lot more important. That's where I go straight to when I see new data.\n\n00:50:41,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tell us your thoughts on that. And then, of course, we had some news just this morning. The FDA announced that there's not a shortage anymore and that could affect the compounders like him. So tell us a little bit of a roundup of what's going on in obesity lately.\n\n00:51:00,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sure, Brad, and I may leave that second part of your question to Luba to cover from a more legal aspect. I know she's been following it very closely. Probably has much more insight than I. But yeah, on the Stat News article, we couldn't agree more. In fact, my colleague, Prakhar Agarwal, who covers the obesity space here for us at Cantor, has been kind of singing the same tune. It's quite surprising that every time a new data set— phase one or phase two— comes out from a a novel GLP-1 or combination partner that the first thing people do is go toward that. Percent weight loss and they analyze in excruciating detail.\n\n00:51:37,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n And treat a 20% reduction in body mass quite differently from a 21% or 22% reduction. So it just doesn't make much sense, right? As you said, tolerability is very important. The other thing that's very important, of course, is convenience.","char_start":46871,"char_end":51037,"start_time":"00:47:45","end_time":null}

So it just doesn't make much sense, right? As you said, tolerability is very important. The other thing that's very important, of course, is convenience.\n\n00:51:55,100 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I don't think patients know whether they're losing 20 or 21 or 22% of their body mass. I think they certainly know if they're. Injecting themselves on a weekly or monthly or maybe even future quarterly basis. I certainly know that they realize whether they're feeling like crap or not on a daily basis because of it. I think that this whole space has a long way to play out. And that, as we start to separate the winners from the losers here, it'll be probably much more on those two latter points— tolerability and convenience— than it'll be on efficacy.\n\n00:52:33,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I'd just like to add, also to that point, happy to cover the legal aspects as well. So I've been talking to and looking at some of the data that is provided by pharmacies like Kim's that are providing a lot of the drug, the glip ones from the compounding factories, pharmacies. And what's interesting is that the tolerability and convenience is something— it's actually divided into men and women. So women seem to be much more interested in female patients. The complete weight loss, although you're right that does somebody really know if it's 20% or 23% weight loss? Men care a lot more about tolerability and some of the side effects such as muscle loss. That's actually been interesting as well, and I'm curious how that will affect sales and development of future drugs.\n\n00:53:37,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Lubit, not to put you on the spot, or if anyone else knows, now that the FDA made this announcement this morning, what is the repercussions for hymns? Like, do they have like.\n\n00:53:52,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Certain time period that they're still able to you do this or like what's what's their status right now yeah so I can tell I mean they knew that this was coming and uh and not just they they We knew because of, clearly, of what Novo and Ilya Lili and others have been saying. But Lili and Novo have filed lawsuits. To force the FDA to declare that there is no longer shortage and to stop distribution of GLP-1s by compounding pharmacies. So this is something that HIMSS has anticipated and knows what's going to happen and has played behind the scenes to I'm sure not make that happen. But this is a major blow now to sales. And so, you know, I'm sure that there are to try to figure out a way to push back.\n\n00:54:50,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n But if the FDA has basically said that's it and that's their final decision, that is going to be their final decision. They can't continue selling drugs from compounders.\n\n00:55:04,220 [SPEAKER_5]\n Just to point out, there's a bit of a subtlety here that's not at all obvious. So if you go through the compounding rules, let's say, Brad, you've got some type of disease and there's an on-patent drug. That, for some reason, isn't going to work.\n\n00:55:19,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n For you, because that's right, that's dosing. Yeah, you're right. I mean, so dosing. Yes, of course. If you have an allergy to a particular ingredient, but the majority of sales have been, uh, because there's the the two factions under which you can make the drug and compounding. So you're right, there's going to be a percentage of those people that still can get it, but certainly not for the mass production that they've had before.\n\n00:55:43,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n So just, just to point out, if you go through the hymns, like, go to it and actually try to get your own obesity prescription. What you'll see is that it will very rapidly try to qualify you as a non-responder to currently available doses.\n\n00:56:00,520 [SPEAKER_5]\n And so their business model shifted about two months ago to what they call customized compounding. And so, Luba, you're right. They've anticipated this. They're one step ahead. The issue that they're going to run into is going to be on the patent side.\n\n00:56:17,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Right.","char_start":50737,"char_end":54886,"start_time":"00:51:37","end_time":null}

As you kind of hinted, you know, have some prescriptions that involve alternative dosing, but at some point, if they're, you know, using dosing rules to essentially dodge compounding regulations, they may find themselves in in a lawsuit over team. novel patents that they're going to have a tough time with.\n\n00:56:44,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:56:47,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n I saw another really interesting obesity. Headline: This morning, I I can't remember where, sadly, but I saw that um, Eli Lilly has already apparently produced like 500 million dollars worth of their their oral therapy that they're that they got from uh that they licensed from Chugai and You Know, that's before the data. And I think that really goes to show what. A big pharma game this is that they're putting 500 million of drug supply at risk if there's a chance that the data doesn't. Turn out to be as strong or successful as they thought it would. That's a. a tough thing for smaller biotech companies to do. And we've talked at lanes about some of the acquisitions that haven't happened yet. And I think it just goes to show the investment that's required for even larger companies to potentially compete in this space. All right.\n\n00:57:46,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Brad, before you exit obesity, we mentioned that while we have been speaking about it, Betaville has a— Viking Therapeutics take-out rumor. So there you go.\n\n00:57:59,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n On a Friday of course on a Friday.\n\n00:58:02,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right. Let me just scan to make sure we didn't miss anything that was absolutely critical.\n\n00:58:11,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think we got everything. We're at the top of the hour. There's actually enough material to do this for a second hour, but we'll kind of stop at that with some of the main news items.\n\n00:58:24,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll give everyone an opportunity to just kind of speak up with any closing remarks, if anyone would like to do that.

You're listening to Biotech Hangout, a live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry with a group of biotech insiders.

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:25,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n So the broader market remains under pressure, driven at least in part by tariff threats and concerns over a potential trade war. The S&P 500 is down 6%. Over the last month, with this week's losses wiping out all post-election gains.\n\n00:00:43,410 [SPEAKER_4]\n Biotech seems to be in a really dark place. The XBI is down 5% this year and small caps are down 17% in the last three months.\n\n00:00:54,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n The IPO market is also at a standstill. The 2024 IPO class has 16 out of 18 companies trading below IPO price. And a median drop of 61%.\n\n00:01:07,730 [SPEAKER_4]\n Looking at 2025 IPOs, three out of four are trading below IPO price and Metzera is one of the only exceptions, basically, perhaps. Because it's one of the few within your term catalysts. Some biotech and healthcare funds have been shutting down due to poor performance and redemptions, forcing them to sell indiscriminately. Long-short biotech funds are already down over 10% this year.\n\n00:01:33,210 [SPEAKER_4]\n On the positive side, Stiefel put out a report last week saying that the time period for redemptions is behind us. Tess, what are you hearing on the investor side? Any reason to be optimistic as a biotech specialist investor?\n\n00:01:47,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n Great question, Daphne. I think the reason to be optimistic is that companies that have made a lot of great fundamental progress are cheaper than they were a few months ago. Right and so for, you know, investors who are in a position to be deploying capital. It's a really rich, you know, very rich opportunity set, both on the uh, you know, public side but also uh, you know, private companies have made exceptional progress, really focused on how they get to as meaningful an inflection point as they can on their capital. And that means that the opportunity set is really great, right? So I think. Um, you know, we've seen markets like this before. It's really not unprecedented.\n\n00:02:31,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n And nothing has really changed in terms of fundamentals. Pharmaceutical companies are still going to need to fill their pipelines. Um, you know, of course we have the uh you know, increased competition from China, but I think that honestly, uh, you know, can can make us all uh, you know, can make us all better and in addition to you know, just helping to refine the the opportunity set can create new uh you know, company opportunities for a lot of investors, so I think that is, that is the bright side, Daphne. As a society, we are not getting any younger. And as we get older and older, we are going to continue to need more health care. And drugs are one of the most efficient ways of delivering that care. That's not gonna change.\n\n00:03:19,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I think that you make some good points about the fundamentals and the need for biopharma innovation.\n\n00:03:28,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n Also, you pointed out that M &A is still very much on the horizon with big pharma companies needing to fill their pipelines also with the patent expirations coming up. M &A is important to helping biotech investors get returns and liquidity and bring generalists into the sector. And we're going to talk about a couple of small deals this week in a moment. But Eric, you've said that the sector is too dependent on M &A. Can you say more about that?","char_start":0,"char_end":3751,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

But Eric, you've said that the sector is too dependent on M &A. Can you say more about that?\n\n00:03:57,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I don't know that I would argue it's too dependent on M &A, but certainly the focus on M &A is probably as substantial as it's ever been. And when we're in a market like we're in, as you eloquently laid out, Daphne, where there's so much going against us, so many stocks are. Are down every week, every day, every month. The ones that kind of shine are the ones that are acquired, right? So it's natural when you have just a few stocks in the green on your screen to. to focus on those names and say, 'Wow, the only way I'm getting paid is through M&A.' And that's certainly the case right now. I do think there are maybe some broader considerations, and I agree with Tess in general, there's a lot to be optimistic for. We've seen this before. We've been here before.\n\n00:04:44,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sheep. Well said. There's still a demand for drugs and the way we create and reimburse. And get paid for drugs really hasn't changed. But I do think the business model of biotech is maybe potentially slightly different than it used to be. In that, as soon as a drug is successfully launched, for those companies that elect to go at it alone, there's this intense focus on, okay, what are you going to do for me next? What is your long-term strategy? How are you going to evolve? How are you going to prevent? Having a patent cliff, you know, years down the road. From that standpoint, maybe the investment outlook for these go-it-alone companies is more severe or more skeptical than it's ever been. And M&A seems like a great way out for those companies that are able to take it.\n\n00:05:34,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's an interesting contrast though, Eric.\n\n00:05:36,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. Because we've had a lot of companies that have done it alone that have performed like super well. Right. I'll just highlight. Um, you know, Madrigal is one. You know, Bill Bill Sybil's at the helm there and obviously very experienced commercial leader. Verona's had exceptional performance as well. Maybe just curious, Eric, when does it go from a like? Hey, wow. Cool. Like you're actually. Doing a launch well, that's unique for a small biotech. Bid the stock up to like, all right, what are you going to do for me next? Like, when does that transition happen?\n\n00:06:12,060 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, that's a great point, Tess. That's the wrong transition that you want to get caught up in, right? If you're an independent biotech, and unfortunately, we have seen. Many companies do just that. Try and persist potentially too long— you're correct, I think the industry is launching more drugs successfully potentially than ever before, and we've had some of the better winners in the industry.\n\n00:06:33,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n Stay out alone and prove investors wrong that they can launch a drug and they can hear that profitability threshold.\n\n00:06:41,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n But then what happens shortly thereafter? It's usually within one or two years, right? And I'd love to hear Brian's views on this too. That the street gets very, very skeptical and says, 'OK, great, we'll give you credit for your cash flow. We can discount that out into the future, but we understand that that cash flow will soon hit a cliff. You're no more valuable than every penny that you can save between now and then.\n\n00:07:08,959 [SPEAKER_4]\n Brian, do you have any thoughts on that?'","char_start":3453,"char_end":7122,"start_time":"00:03:57","end_time":null}

You know, it really ties the company to actual financial fundamentals. You know, prior to launch, things are so ambiguous— as as to what uh you know the the company's ultimate value is going to be. You know, these stocks are all story stocks until that day. So, you know, that's why I think M&A becomes very important. Right, because the since the birth of the sector, the thought process has always been that— you know, pharma is bad at R&D but they're good at commercialization. Biotech is bad at commercialization but they're— um, good at R&D.\n\n00:08:14,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n And therefore, there is the marriage that kind of creates that constant view that M&A is going to be, at least to some extent, a driver of the sector. I i kind of agree with that. Right now, I think it's a little bit too much of a uh uh a hope for the sector. And you know, there may be a little bit of an overall alliance that M&A is going to come and save the day somehow, rather than just focusing on the fundamentals.\n\n00:08:38,059 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I can tie in, because Eric mentioned that maybe we need the industry or the sector needs to change the fundamentals of the strategy.\n\n00:08:47,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, biotech is not great at launching me-too products, right? But biotech is fairly good at launching badly needed, differentiated assets that really create markets or really address a need. And maybe that's the clincher here: is that maybe we need to accept higher risk programs that are really going to make a difference. And we probably need to invest in a lot less me-too's, you know.\n\n00:09:13,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, that's an interesting point. And Johan, this week was the Cowan Healthcare Conference. Lots of investors, lots of people were in Boston this week. I know that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talked a little bit about their perspective on M &A. Can you tell us what the takeaways were from the conference, including any pharma commentary on BD and M&A?\n\n00:09:38,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, perfect.\n\n00:09:40,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I'll start with a broad stroke. So, you know, I got to tell you that the Cowan Conference, and it's really been great to see. It's really gaining momentum each year, and it's making sort of new highs each year in attendance. And it's becoming a little bit more of an industry conference, at least a Wall Street conference, than just sort of one kind of a firm conference.\n\n00:10:02,190 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sentiment, as we said, was poor. One of the key things—this is how much companies are talking about how much they can stretch their cash and how many programs they're cutting, which is good to see. Um, another clear situation is we saw, and I know Eric might talk about it, the jazz chimerics deal, let's say. There are a lot of oncology assets that are ready to launch products or in phase three with products that are expected to be niche-y. And someone probably needs to consolidate them.\n\n00:10:36,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n They're all trading at cash. It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The good news is it's all upside at this point. So to answer your question about Pfizer, so Pfizer, because they talked specifically about oncology. They said capacity for BD, and this is coming from Steve Scala, who is our colleague, is going to be higher than it was last year.\n\n00:10:58,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n This year it's going to be 10 of 15, next year it's going to be even higher. So there's a little bit of a hint there, as you know, during oncology, vaccines, internal medicine, and in immunology.","char_start":6822,"char_end":11133,"start_time":"00:07:08","end_time":null}

So there's a little bit of a hint there, as you know, during oncology, vaccines, internal medicine, and in immunology.\n\n00:11:08,840 [SPEAKER_0]\n In vaccines, they really don't see a lot of BD opportunities. They have a fairly robust internal pipeline. In ontology, obviously, they just acquired Cgen, so they have a lot going on. They don't need a lot of external innovation, other than smaller that can be combinable with an ADC. So there's a big hint there. Clearly, what they're going to be focusing is internal medicine and INI.\n\n00:11:33,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n And you know, it's not going to be a shocker. INI is obviously a huge theme for for us and many people. There's so much going on now. First of all, in the brain, between MMN, CIDP, GMG, I mean these markets are really growing. Some of them are totally nascent, multiple competitors now, but all new biology. So it's not yes, there is a 'me too' theme with an FCRN, but um, there's a lot of new biology. Then you're seeing a lot going on now in my side, us in Sjogren's, in TED, in all sort of humor rejection, in Graves, Disney's. There's a lot going on in COPD, obviously, a lot going on in ads. Also, new modalities and inhaled biologics. So it's really incredible. That's kind of a huge thing for us. And then another one that's clearly emerging, which is there. It's not new, but it's going to become maybe more biotech-centric in a very competitive way, is obesity. This ADA is not going to be the Lily Novo. Show it's probably going to be more of the biotech show.\n\n00:12:35,056 [SPEAKER_0]\n Amgen is going to have a lot of data, including their ghosts, you know, go fast and low escalation that they really are convinced will be much better tolerated. They now started their phase three. They announced that earlier this week. And then Metzera is going to have a lot of data. Chilera, that's the new Bain Atlas RTW spin out out of Hungary. They have pretty impressive data. And they're going to show phase three and phase two data this year, and they're moving to phase three. And of course, there's going to be obviously data from some of the traditional sort of biotics that have been out there. So there's actually a lot going on that leads us to be fairly optimistic. Valuations cannot go any lower, knock on wood.\n\n00:13:17,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and it's interesting what you said about the Cowan Conference. I think of it like there's three conferences in the industry where other banks show up where there's a lot of industry events generally.\n\n00:13:29,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n Cowan is now one of them. There's the Jeffries Conference in London, and of course, JP Morgan. So it's great to see that.\n\n00:13:38,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n So let's talk about some deals, small deals this week. Jazz Pharmaceuticals announced it's acquiring Chimerix for about $935 million. 72% premium. Eric, what are your thoughts on this deal?\n\n00:13:53,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n So Yaron just mentioned that there are a lot of companies out there, especially oncology, that have kind of niche products and would be better as part of another larger entity or organization. And I think this deal speaks exactly to that type of trend. Chimerix came out of nowhere with a drug called Dordavipro. This was just a $1 stock. Three or four months ago. And the trigger for them was that the FDA was able to encourage them, or at least they gained alignment with the FDA on an accelerated approval strategy in a fairly rare subset of pediatric glioma. This is not a large patient population, maybe 1 to 2,000 patients in the US. Of course you can expect premium pricing and I think of course they will make this into, you know, a multi-hundred-million-dollar opportunity, but.\n\n00:14:44,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n But that was a big deal when they were at least encouraged or aligned with the FDA to file for approval based on phase two data. They subsequently received priority review and.\n\n00:14:57,089 [SPEAKER_3]\n Congrats to the management team for executing. Around that value creation.\n\n00:15:02,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n We do think that jazz has done similar deals of this nature before. I think jazz really has been built on. an acquisition strategy where they're looking for singles and doubles and not necessarily home runs.","char_start":10833,"char_end":15256,"start_time":"00:10:58","end_time":null}

I think jazz really has been built on. an acquisition strategy where they're looking for singles and doubles and not necessarily home runs.\n\n00:15:16,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n And Chimerix, with its 10 plus year public market history, much of that was a struggle. Again, good for them. So this is really a deal where. I think one plus one can equal three. It's not going to turn too many heads. As you mentioned, Daphne, it's a sub $1 billion transaction.\n\n00:15:32,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n But it seems like the right thing to put Dordavacrone into the hands of someone who already has an oncology franchise and can drive better margin from this product economically. I mean, this is just a financial transaction.\n\n00:15:46,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it makes sense. So I'll pause and see if others want to comment.\n\n00:15:53,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n That seems to have been a well-received deal on all sides. There was another small deal, the AbbVie Gubra deal, which includes $350 million upfront and $1. 87 billion in biobucks. I'd love to hear from Tess on what you think about the deal and AbbVie's move into the obesity space.\n\n00:16:13,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. I think. First, really not a surprise that this is a space that's very relevant for AbbVie, right? I mean, recall they have a leading aesthetics portfolio and obviously GLP-1s do a lot more than aesthetics, but. There's many ways in which it's really complimentary with their business and their portfolio. I think this was an interesting move into obesity because you know, it's taking a very different approach than most of the BD that we've seen where, you know, companies are really leading. with a GLP-1 and building on that. And Abby chose to lead with an amylin. And one of the things that is interesting that they highlighted. Um, about the uh, you know, gubra—uh, compound is that this has a uh, you know, a half-life that's that's pretty long, about uh, you know, 270 hours. So that can you know, enable perhaps less frequent dosing.\n\n00:17:16,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, you know, it's interesting, I think some analysts noted that AbbVie is looking for weight loss of about 15 to 20 percent, just on a standalone basis, you know, for Good Bread's amylin product.\n\n00:17:29,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think that's I think that's pretty interesting because I think that is. You know, probably a bit, you know, a bit higher than, you know, what I think, you know, we've, you know, we've observed from, you know, from other ambulance in the past. So it is an interesting entree into the field and would not be surprised to see this followed by perhaps some smaller deals to continue building a portfolio in this space.\n\n00:18:00,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thank you for summarizing that. It's interesting. Some of these companies have been slower to get into obesity. And I know Pfizer also. said something recently about it being almost too late for them to get in. So it's just interesting to see. How different pharma companies are looking at what has been a very hot space.\n\n00:18:20,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep. And I just, sorry, just to add something on top of that, I just say like. It's interesting because I don't think it's ever too late for something that's different, right? And what Jeroen was saying about obesity not just being a big pharma game, but really being a biotech game. And we're seeing that with the work that several biotechs are doing where, you know, Matt, Sarah's coming out with. Know with a monthly and they're working on, you know, the oral peptide and you know those have a potential to be differentiated right so. And we see other companies, like Diva, also working on an oral peptide that has a long half-life and that could potentially improve tolerability. So I think it's important to remember that. These are big markets, and when we've seen such big markets in the past, you know, there's a lot of room to.\n\n00:19:16,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n you know, make solutions that are better than the first generation. And so I think that continues to be a big biotech opportunity. even with good products on the market.\n\n00:19:28,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, for sure. And it seems like the opportunity is shifted towards. tolerability, muscle sparing and other areas as opposed to increasing efficacy.","char_start":14956,"char_end":19373,"start_time":"00:15:02","end_time":null}

And it seems like the opportunity is shifted towards. tolerability, muscle sparing and other areas as opposed to increasing efficacy.\n\n00:19:39,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n But it's a really interesting space to continue to watch. A few weeks ago, actually, you were on this episode when we talked about these so-called zombie biotechs, or what I prefer to call fallen angels. And these are companies that have a significant amount of cash. But had a pipeline set back and are now trading at a negative enterprise value. There is one, I think one or two obesity companies in that mix, but we're now talking about. Just broadly, there's a lot of companies like that out there. And we talked about ways that these could return value to shareholders, which includes reverse mergers, acquiring new assets. And also, one that's been less popular— liquidating and returning cash to shareholders. So, Tang Capital has been very active in identifying these opportunities and has been in many ways an unlikely white knight for shareholders in these companies, offering them a way to cash out. And Adam Feuerstein was on. few weeks ago and we talked about this. He wrote another piece this week about Tang.\n\n00:20:42,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n And what the news was this week was that Tang had offered a cellar in an unsolicited three dollars per share acquisition offer, but they announced this week that they're sticking with their planned merger with Illumis and they're turning down that offer. Accelerant stock dropped 13 percent after the news. showing some investor skepticism about the merger. which ultimately time and trial results are going to tell if the merger is a smart move or not. But it sounds like there's more pressure from shareholders to take these types of cash deals, and less patience for reverse mergers or just seeing how these different theses play out. Brian, I'd love to hear what you think about this generally. And then, if you could talk a little bit about one of these fallen angels, which is Pliant Therapeutics. And so let's start with any commentary you have generally, and then we'll talk about Pliant.\n\n00:21:34,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, thanks so. Yeah, I mean, maybe in general, I mean, obviously, it's a big problem for the sector. I don't know what the the latest count is, but um, you know, there's, for the last several years, there's generally been, somewhere around, you know, at least in excess of 100, but up, upwards of, I think, at 1. 200 names that were negative NPV, which really indicates that shareholders are valuing the company as if the cash that it has in the bank is just going to be invested to be a zero, right? The assets themselves hold no value and you'll just burn. Um and you know that, that's resulted in a lot of uh, structural changes to companies. You see a lot of reverse mergers occur. Um, you know, some shareholders have—uh— an activist with some of these names trying to force um capital to get returned to shareholders instead. Um, and you know, obviously, the alumus celeron deal is one uh—uh— example of that. With Tine Capital. You know, I would just say I cover Loomis and I would say I do think it's a really, really good deal for Loomis.\n\n00:22:39,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think it's a fantastic infusion of capital. You know, if the shareholders of a seller have confidence in the TIC2 program at Loomis, I think they're getting a good deal there. But that's obviously a point for debate. But you know, when we kind of talk about zombie companies, a lot of cash on client therapeutics had a setback this week. They wound up discontinuing a phase 2b study. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, called the Beacon IPF study, and this came following a DSMB recommendation—uh, doing an imbalance of unadjudicated IPF-related adverse events. Stocks about down about 40 this week. Um, but this has kind of been a slow car crash over the last month. It's down 80 over the last month. This was just kind of the final nail put in the coffin for this study. But it started last month when the DSMB initially recommended pausing enrollment in the study. The company then assembled an outside expert panel to review unblinded data from this study. So this week just kind of marked the end of the program. But now the company's sitting at $350 million in cash at the end.","char_start":19073,"char_end":23547,"start_time":"00:19:28","end_time":null}

But now the company's sitting at $350 million in cash at the end.\n\n00:23:41,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n of the year, um, and as of today, it's something about 100 million in market caps or about 250 million dollars, uh, net cash, uh, above market cap. So, um, you know, it's part of now this list of very long negative EV names in the sector, um, not to go on a tangent, but uh, Biogen actually had a drug in development for IPF with a similar MOE, alpha-V-beta-8. This was alpha-V-beta-6, but both utilizing alpha.\n\n00:24:10,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n the integrand subunits, and it discontinued after also seeing an imbalance in IPF exacerbations a few years ago. So targeting alpha V has been a bit of a buffer. bit of a rough road. The company has a number of other alpha-V targeting drugs. So I think that negative sentiment kind of implies that the market is reading that this target or at least the subunit might have some broader issues. I would just say that IPF has been a very tough disease.\n\n00:24:36,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n Overall and clinical trials here have been particularly difficult to run. I don't know if anyone else has any thoughts. Thoughts there.\n\n00:24:45,500 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, one of the things that was interesting about client was: The stock traded down sharply before the original DSMB announcement. And what was happening was. Apparently, they had updated something on clinicaltrials. gov about recruiting status in the US.\n\n00:25:03,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n That I don't know who picked up on it, but the stock traded down quite a lot. I think it was like 40% before the announcement and then that announcement came out. So this has been, as you said, sort of a slow train wreck. You know, I am conflicted in the area of IPF, so I won't comment specifically. I do think that there's some interesting programs, but love to hear from you. Anyone else about client or IPF more generally.\n\n00:25:29,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n Really challenging space, very big unmet need, right? So Daphne, I assume you're talking about all the work that the PureTech team is doing on IPF and really coming back with a better version. You know, of Esprit, which is one of the approved drugs. Um, you know, so you know, I think, uh, you know, I think, what you know, part of the part of the challenge here is there are really just a few mechanisms that we have seen work in IPF, right? And there's a lot of room to improve, primarily on the tolerability profile of some of the drugs that are currently approved for IPF. Good that there's important work continuing on that.\n\n00:26:16,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe if I could just go back to the Alumus Aceleron. Merger that the Ten Capital Group tried to thwart earlier. This week.\n\n00:26:26,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, like Brian, I cover Loomis, and I think this is a good deal from their standpoint. But I also want to give a big shout out to the board and the management team at Acceleron. They had the potential to become a biotech zombie, Daphne, as you mentioned.\n\n00:26:41,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n They took very quick and swift action, thoughtful action, in my opinion. To prevent that from happening, whether it's tang or luminous, that in the end ends up merging with the cellar. The easy thing to do, if you were a seller, would be to take the money you raised that was initially dedicated to what's now a failed project and reinvest it into pipeline drugs that know, previously, you didn't think were deserving of capital and it prioritized accordingly. They chose not to do that. Instead, they chose to essentially lay off the workforce. Seek an alternative.\n\n00:27:19,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n Route to deploy the capital. And I think it's going to be a more efficient route than throwing good money after bad. We don't see this happen enough, in my opinion. And again, I just want to give a positive shout out to. A team that took quick action to try and make the most out of its unfortunate lot in our industry.\n\n00:27:41,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, that's a great point.\n\n00:27:44,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n Agree with you 100 percent that boards have a responsibility to think about how they create the most value for shareholders and sometimes there's conflicting.","char_start":23247,"char_end":27642,"start_time":"00:23:41","end_time":null}

And it does take a lot too to look at things differently and make a big strategic shift such as this or such as returning cash to shareholders. So, I agree with you 100 percent. And kudos to the board and the team that they're willing to do that.\n\n00:28:18,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n So switching gears, we had talked a little bit about biotechs and their ability to launch drugs. Biohaven and their former form, we're one of the few successful biotechs launching a drug. New BioHaven had some news this week. So love to hear from you, Brian, on the BioHaven news.\n\n00:28:37,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, great. Thanks. So, you know, I don't know what it's about me that court's coverage of controversial names, but this is certainly one of them. They had news this week. They have an interesting, somewhat differentiated PR strategy. They sort of provide, you know, very general updates or, in other words, they'll update multiple programs on once, and that may be, uh, due to the fact that they're, you know, at any given time, they're running like 15 or 16 different programs. Um, so updating individual programs is very hard. But you know, periodically, a number of program updates at once, and and that's what we had this week, and I think. One of the things that jumped off the page initially to people was they had a bipolar disorder study that they announced did not hit the primary endpoint. It was for their KD7. Channel activator, um. You know, I actually think expectations here were were pretty much zero. I I really didn't have, you know, the only calls I really had on it is to sort of gauge what it would mean for Xenon, which also has a KB7, um, lead program, um.\n\n00:29:42,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n In a number of indications and look, you know, I think the reason here is this was an acute mania episodes and bipolar disorder, and there really wasn't a lot of preclinical or clinical evidence that KB7 would have an impact here. You know, I think the majority of KB7 programs, including biohavens, rest of their phase two and phase three studies are not in. Um, mania, but more looking at, um, epileptic seizures or depression, that seems to be where the focus is. But I think, for Biohaven investors, and where the controversy kind of really sprung out is really on their uh molecular degrader program, um they have a lead program targeting IGG and you know, you know Aaron kind of mentioned this um in terms of the FCRN space, but they're sort of trying to go uh head to head with uh the FCRNs out there uh in in terms of rapidly lowering uh IGG, um and the debate here you know has really been multi-fold, um the data has trickled out very slowly, but it does have very, very robust reductions in IgG.\n\n00:30:46,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n They announced this week at 1,000 milligrams, they're seeing an 84% reduction following four doses. So this is numerically better than we've seen for the FCRNs. I think a big part of the argument is it's not quite up to par with what the pre-clinical modeling was showing at Biohaven and is not really, you know, a standard deviation beyond what the FCRNs are showing. I think if you look at the multiple ascending dose study for F-Cartigamide is about a 75%. Reduction over four weekly doses. So, you know, the argument now is. Coming to market years afterwards, um, you know, is maybe a five ten percent uh relative improvement in IGG reductions, is it gonna be meaningful now? Now, I i sort of love this greater story overall, I think. You know, while this is the lead. Drug, uh, you know, they have a robust pipeline of other degraders. At J. P. Morgan, they had IDA and the property data for a GDIGA. One degrader showed really what I think is game-changing ability to rapidly reduce this pathogenic.","char_start":27342,"char_end":31499,"start_time":"00:27:41","end_time":null}

I think you're going to hear more and more about these extracellular protein degrader programs. Biohaven is sort of the main public one, but there are a number of other ones that are private that have very strong backing. Carolyn Bertozzi's Lycea. And I know, Tassi, you're on the board of Avalor, so I'd love to hear any thoughts that you have on the subject as well.\n\n00:32:24,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. Really important space and, you know, certainly encouraging to see such a strong profile coming out of Biohaven. So as you say, more to come.\n\n00:32:36,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n If we have a second, maybe let me chime in because I think very apropos, and Brian, by the way, we were coming limiting you on our little chat about we love the fact that you have controversial stocks because you have opinions and you take them on. So kudos to you. Um, but on the comment on IgG, so we're all waiting for the ImmunoVent data, which is going to test, you know, obviously more potent IgG reductions.\n\n00:33:03,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n We saw everyone's good friend, Matt Klein, who's a guest here frequently at our conference. That data is expected imminently. I don't think they know the data yet, but clearly. They're expecting a dose-response. It's probably not going to be completely linear, like a graph, but it's going to be obviously fairly evident.\n\n00:33:23,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n The placebo effects, and I think this is exactly what Brian is talking about, there is no necessarily linearity between IgG reduction and clinical outcomes because these are complicated disorders. And so what's going on in GMG now is, you can see the data, and I think this is what the event and immune event are intimating— the placebo effect has gone up in GMG. So the delta, you know, between active and placebo is shrinking, even if you can achieve a higher reduction, let's say an NGADL on the clinical endpoint with slightly better IgG reduction. So it's not, it's a little complicated.\n\n00:34:00,429 [SPEAKER_0]\n The good news is I think there is some data suggesting that you can go fairly low on IgG without impacting infections. That was also discussed at our conference. But it might be getting to the point, as you said, that we're getting fairly potent, and then it's up to the clinical trial design to kind of work out.\n\n00:34:18,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thanks, Yaron. And I want to stay with you. We were talking about M &A and obviously one impact on M &A is when M &A goes south. So. BMS decided to discontinue a program they acquired via $4.8 billion. dollar purchase of Maradi Therapeutics this week so your own what are your thoughts on this decision and any implications beyond BMS.\n\n00:34:47,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n So you know this is really interesting and this is real innovation uh you know we used to cover Marauding then our colleague Tyler covered it um so MRTX113 was essentially the first G12D inhibitor, as we all know, it's highly expressed and involved in pancreatic cancer and in some of the other solid tumors, a huge unmet need. The challenge with that compound and many many remember it was originally IV and the PK was fairly challenging, so they made it into a liposomal formulation, which is always tough but may be acceptable for pancreatic. And then they took that different formulation, which they really comment much about, into an oral. And it failed. The compound always looked very good pre-clinically in terms of potency, but the issue and it failed because of PK, I think that this along with the PRMT5, which so far has been a little disappointing as a class.\n\n00:35:48,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n But, you know, potentially, Amgen and Maradi's companies might not be best in class. There's some other ones coming behind.","char_start":31199,"char_end":35508,"start_time":"00:31:50","end_time":null}

There's some other ones coming behind.\n\n00:35:54,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, that acquisition is disappointed a little bit, certainly on the commercial side, despite the expectation that Maradi will win the market. Amgen is still the number one brand in the market.\n\n00:36:08,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n It just shows, you know, M &A, as we know, is complicated. You know, we always advertise, you know, advise going earlier and taking clinical risk as opposed to buying something later that's, quote unquote, more the risk, but fairly expensive.\n\n00:36:23,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thank you. So I want to switch gears and move towards some of the new administration-related news. So we'll start with RFK. I heard there was a second death in the Texas measles outbreak. Today. I don't know if that's been confirmed yet. I was interested to see that RFK put out a statement earlier. This week. That sounded very pro-vaccination, but there were some mixed messages in there. Tess, what are your thoughts on RFK and just generally the outbreak, and any thoughts on vaccines in general?\n\n00:36:58,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, yeah, it's obviously very unfortunate, you know, to see that the outbreak continues to grow. I think, you know, CDC, you know, updated cases today, I think it's at, you know, around 225 cases. And as you said.\n\n00:37:12,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, we've seen multiple deaths at this point. I think the CDC has one confirmed. One that they are checking on. Um and you know, I think Daphne, the Fox News.\n\n00:37:27,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Op-ed that RFK wrote. It was interesting because, if you looked at the headlines, I think the headlines looked very positive. Um, and then you kind of read through it and it was like, 'ooh, I don't know, like, doesn't really sound like your full endorsement because it was a little, you know, to me, and I love others' impressions because maybe I'm reading this with, you know, with the history of other statements that he's made. Um, But to me, it was a little wishy-washy around, just like, you know, rather than saying, 'you know,' uh, the uh, you know, rather than a more kind of like full endorsement of vaccines as the solution to this that was really emphasizing. You know, hey, there's an importance of individual choice and you know, you've got to understand, like. You know, you need a very balanced view on safety and efficacy. That's kind of like, OK, does that mean that like the view now is like imbalanced? Like what's what's kind of like the layer behind, you know, these statements that are maybe not quite as robust?\n\n00:38:32,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, and I think individual choice obviously is. Uh, you know, a really important factor here, but uh, you know, individual choice when you know, there's a very robust understanding of just how important it is and how lifesaving it can be. You know, to have access to something as, you know, fundamental as the MMR vaccine, you know, so it struck me as, you know, strong headlines, and then a little fuzzier beneath, you know, beneath the surface, especially when we consider, you know, some of the other you know, some of the other statements and some of the actions around ACIP. But, you know, certainly interested if others have a view that's maybe a little, you know, a little rosier than mine.\n\n00:39:17,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I definitely had the same impression. So the headlines were, you know, definitely.\n\n00:39:24,180 [SPEAKER_4]\n very pro-vaccination. And then, if you went and you read down, it said things about, I think it was fish oil. I mean, it was definitely a mixed message. And I was curious, actually, to hear from you, Eric, because you were following the McCary. hearing He was asked about vaccines, and it seemed very similar in terms of the messaging, where it was directionally positive, but not as definitive, probably, as what most in our industry would like. I'd love to hear your thoughts generally.","char_start":35208,"char_end":39392,"start_time":"00:35:48","end_time":null}

I mean, how could you not? Read anything from The NIH or or the NCI or sorry, not the CDC or— or. Other HHS-related agencies these days with a little bit of a prejudiced eye. And actually, just as we were talking on this webcast, there's a report from Reuters that is coming out saying that the CDC is planning a large study into the link between vaccines and autism, a link that many of us believe has already been completely debunked. So with those types of headlines out there. I mean, what's next? NASA is going to plan a study into whether the Earth is round. This is just getting to be a little bit absurd and um, and it's very unfortunate for those of us who feel that public health and safety is at risk here. You know, moving to the question of Marty Markery's hearing, I thought it was pretty boring, to be honest.\n\n00:40:53,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n I didn't think we learned anything. Sort of played the game— not to lose. I think it's a foregone conclusion that Both he and Shatabari are going to be confirmed to their respective positions of FDA commissioner. Head of the NIH.\n\n00:41:10,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n But to me, you know, they knew that and especially.\n\n00:41:15,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n In terms of the commentary that we heard around vaccines and what they may or may not do. I thought. I thought Mark Reed kind of took the fifth. I thought he.\n\n00:41:27,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n He just said, 'Look, I'll deal with it when I get into office.' I really don't have a view now. I'll take an analysis-based approach.\n\n00:41:37,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n And follow at least the data. So maybe, from that standpoint, it was a little bit better than what we've heard from prior confirmation hearings from this administration, but I don't think we learned a thing.\n\n00:41:54,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I throw a quick question unscripted? I think I might have asked this like a few months ago. A year from now, are things better, the same, or worse than we're thinking they're going to be now on the FDA HSS level?\n\n00:42:13,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that's a great question, Jerome. I mean, I'd be really curious as to how people feel. Obviously, when Macri does get into the FDA, he's going to inherit some troubles, right? A low morale agency that feels like it's been pushed around and deprioritized. So, how he deals with that. Know first few months of his administration, I think, is going to be extraordinarily telling. And I just am not sure what the outcome will be.\n\n00:42:46,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Same. And then it can kind of go both ways on the vaccine stuff, right? I guess.\n\n00:42:53,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, there's a there's a bear case that like. You know, hey, do things get worse? Because, you know, there's more. Um you know there's a lot more attention on um Okay. things that we think have actually been appropriately debunked in the past, like this link to autism. But. There's also the potential for things to go the other way, right? Where it's like, 'oh my gosh, this like crazy measles outbreak. And like, why did so many people die? And like, let's not do that again. Like, who wants to? Be like an outbreak like president right so um it you know it's hard you know that one's kind of hard and maybe you know that one's kind of hard for me to gauge in terms of where I could go and I can see I can, you know, really see. kind of equivalent arguments for how things could get. worse. and also how things could get better, unfortunately. I think the way that things get better is.\n\n00:43:48,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n you know, reminders that vaccines are really important for public health. And unfortunately, those reminders tend to come at the expense of public health at some point.\n\n00:44:00,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep.","char_start":39092,"char_end":43229,"start_time":"00:39:50","end_time":null}

And we're going to have John Crowley, who's the CEO of Bio, on next week. And he's been a little bit closer to the administration. I think he can comment. I have heard generally that Marty McCary is viewed as somebody that the industry can work well with. So we'll keep. stay tuned on this, but related to this topic. We were on break last week when Pfizer announced that former FDA director, Patricia Cavazzoni, had joined the company as CMO. And the move sparked some mixed feedback, including criticism on the, quote, revolving door between the FDA and Big Pharma. On the one hand, and then positive feedback from others who note the importance of cross-pollination. Expertise. Brian, I'd love to hear your perspective on this.\n\n00:44:51,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I certainly have opinions on this. Our weekly recap note to clients actually was titled 'Revolving Regulatory Door Triggers Synchronous Face Palms.'\n\n00:45:03,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think, I think at the surface, we look at this and just, you know, given The Trump administration's current positioning, some of the people high up in help, whether it be RFK Jr., Cali Means, just the idea of Pfizer hiring Cavazzoni directly from FDA. Um, just seems like really bad PR, and then I could you know I would think like RFK and CALI means heads are exploding at just hearing about this. Um and you know, so now you have Scott Gotley there as a director, you have Capstone as chief medical officer, and look, I mean there's certainly a ton of criticism about the revolving door between regulatory and industry. And, you know, we all look— I use consultants who are ex-FDA people. They do very well. They're some of the highest high paid consultants we use. Certainly, there's no shortage of them who have gone inside of companies themselves. I could probably rattle off a dozen or so former office or division directors who are now within industry.\n\n00:46:04,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that closeness has led to a lot of criticism. I mean, if you are looking for a job at Pfizer, are you going to cozy up too much to the people internal there as you're reviewing their drug? There very much runs that risk and that's been a big criticism of the administration, in particular those in the healthcare side of the administration. But there's also value too. Right, I mean, um, you know, I want to use these people because I want to understand what is the FDA thinking, what is this division, and if you truly be unbiased and truly eliminate. Conflicts of interest and any sort of quid pro quo are important. Then it's enormously valuable, right? I mean, if you are Pfizer, you want to know what the regulators want in terms of clinical trial design. terms of what's the endpoints they really care about, what's going to sync a program, what's going to make it be successful. So it's important. And I find it very hard to go back and forth with with that ethical dilemma. Um and and really understand it, you know.\n\n00:47:04,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n The other funny thing that we were saying, um, internally, uh, and you know, I think this is. This is not to poke fun at Trump, right? There's a lot of inconsistencies in the administration, right? On one hand, on the healthcare side of things, they're, you know, very much against sort of industry. and regulatory interaction or coziness to that extent. But there's other areas where they're completely deregulatory. So I said, well, on one hand, it kind of has really bad PR to higher capasone. I said, there's probably at least a 20% chance that in the next six months, we hear that the FDA is going to be completely eliminated. Pfizer will just handle regulatory regulation of drugs. from here on out. But yeah, I mean, it's definitely was a controversial thing to see happen in the last week.","char_start":42929,"char_end":47076,"start_time":"00:43:48","end_time":null}

But yeah, I mean, it's definitely was a controversial thing to see happen in the last week.\n\n00:47:52,310 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, it's interesting. She was criticized when she joined FDA because she worked at Lilly and Pfizer, and now she's criticized for going back to industry. But the whole idea of what constitutes a conflict is interesting to discuss. For example, I got in a discussion with Vinay Prasad. I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with him. But he's very prominent on social media. And he came out with a statement saying, 'If your oncologist has ever taken any money from pharma, you should fire them and find another oncologist. If your family member has cancer or something like that.' And he and I got in a discussion about this, because that would essentially be removing the most highly regarded oncologists who participate in clinical trials and have a broad perspective on new treatments. And my concern is people have other types of conflicts. So, for example, in the case of Prasad, he gets subscription fees, and he benefits from making controversial statements. So, sometimes, conflicts may be less apparent, and some experts might be perceived as conflicted. But they, you know, in the case of oncologists, they're usually very dedicated and caring people and want what's best for patients.\n\n00:48:57,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n So this whole topic. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm just, I'm so with you, Daphne.\n\n00:49:03,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n Also, the idea that, like, you know, look, what are you doing? Like, you know, when you're accepting money from pharma as, like, an oncologist, what is the typical way you're doing that? It's because you were part of a clinical trial. Where you were like, 'I would like to see if this drug works and can help patients.' Are you saying that doctors shouldn't do that because it's a conflict? And so what does that mean? We shouldn't have clinical trials or doctors have to choose between patient care and just clinical trials? It just, you know, I think you can really go too far. I think a key thing about conflicts is disclosure, right? That, um, you know, I think just people being aware of, uh, you know, here's, here's, uh, you know, here's where I come from, and like, this is. These are drugs that are being studied. And the purpose of studying them is for XYZ. And yes, it's helpful to have patients aware. You don't want a physician who's actively encouraging patients to go on a trial where they might get randomized to a drug that you know has a very high toxicity profile with very, you know, limited chance of benefit with like a poor standard of care arm, but then, like, what ethics committee is really\n\n00:50:14,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n going to approve that trial in the first place? So I agree with you. I think it's really important to. you know, separate out, like, what are we really worried about with conflicts? How do we ensure appropriate disclosure and appropriate controls? So Brian, you were talking about Patricia leaving the FDA, there's very strict rules about like her ability to like outreach to people on the FDA. Like, I think, you know, I agree, like this. really not a good look for our sector. But there's actually quite a lot of controls in terms of. uh you know what she is able to do to like really uh you know call a review team and like tell them to make a certain decision it's like one she's not their boss anymore and like two I think there's actual rules that says she's not allowed to do that. So I think we need to address this whole issue with a lot more nuance so that we don't lose the value of collaboration that is required to get a drug to market.\n\n00:51:17,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, the other control that's on the system here is moral character.\n\n00:51:23,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I think most of us are scientists, all of us are scientists on this call. Many of us know many scientists and generally speaking, scientists are wonderful people who who get into the business of science or just the nature of science by virtue of being. curious and analytical and driven by the truth.

And that's really disheartening to me and I'm sure many of you all as well.\n\n00:52:01,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm not sure quite where it's coming from and what we can do to to fight it, maybe more science education is something that we need to pay more attention to.\n\n00:52:13,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, it's a good point. I think that there's a lot of blowback from everything that happened in COVID.\n\n00:52:21,190 [SPEAKER_4]\n Some perceptions of the scientific community being dismissive and also a little bit arrogant, I think. Uh, towards the rest of the world, so there's— we're dealing with a little bit of that as well. But hopefully, it's going to be more balanced going forward. So we're almost at time. I think we had a couple more topics that we wanted to touch on. Eric, you and I were going to talk a little bit about networking best practices. And I don't know if you want to kick it off and then I can comment as well.\n\n00:52:54,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I think what stimulated this is our back channel discussion, Daphne, on your very eloquent post on X.\n\n00:53:01,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n where you know you invited some feedback to folks on how to reach out. I think all of us on this call get pinged on social media or email or other channels. All the time, probably with requests from younger people to network.\n\n00:53:17,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n And you know, first I'd say keep those requests coming. None of us are so old that we don't remember how difficult it is to break into the biotech industry. And I know we're all on some level flattered that when we do get pinged, it's because you know, we're viewed as trustworthy enough to be sought after for our advice or help. And oftentimes, I'm very very impressed by the way in which some of the younger generation approach networking with the maturity and professionalism that I never had at that stage of my career. But yeah, every now and then we kind of get a request, Daphne, that might fall a little bit short of the mark. So why don't you continue with a quick summary of your thoughts?\n\n00:53:57,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah. So, I mean, I think that what prompted me to post was actually a positive interaction. So, I had somebody reach out to me and say, 'This amazing person that worked with me just applied for a job.' And if you want to talk, give me a call. And I went. And that made me go and talk to our H. R. person and say, 'I just got inbound, unsolicited feedback on one of the candidates.' And it sort of prompted it to move that person up. And then on the other hand, you get people who reach out to you. And I was thinking about, like, earlier in your career, you want to network for the sake of networking.\n\n00:54:35,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n Some people, as you get busier, there's less of an interest for networking for the sake of networking. There's some unwritten rules that seem to be worthwhile talking about. One piece of advice that I put out there, and I'm happy to get feedback on it, one piece of advice is to be very straightforward and specific about what you want when getting introduced. Because people sometimes get connected to a CEO or someone senior within pharma or an investor like Tess, and they say, 'Oh, I want to pick your brain,' or 'I want to ask for career advice,' or 'I want to hear about your company or your journey.' When what they really want is a job, or they really want to expand their network and just be able to know more people. But if someone's busy, it's better to come with specific ask or a goal you know a goal that you want coming out of it. And I was also thinking about the concept of helping or being polite, and, as you mentioned, Eric, a lot of us want to help others and make introductions. But if somebody asks you to make an intro to a high-powered person— you know, and I'm not talking about myself.","char_start":50831,"char_end":55049,"start_time":"00:51:48","end_time":null}

And I was also thinking about the concept of helping or being polite, and, as you mentioned, Eric, a lot of us want to help others and make introductions. But if somebody asks you to make an intro to a high-powered person— you know, and I'm not talking about myself.\n\n00:55:39,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n I'm saying somebody asks me to make an intro to somebody else I know. You know, initially you may feel like it's impolite or unhelpful to say no, but every time you introduce someone to another party—and if that party, like let's just say it's somebody at Big Pharma, if they view that introduction as uninteresting or low value— you've now taken an ax to your relationship with that person. And that hurts you. It also hurts your ability to make other connections in the future. So what I was saying on this sort of thread was: doing some research can help. And also, sometimes understanding this principle of hurting your connection. and protecting your network makes the connections you do have more powerful. There's other best practices like the dual opt-in, meaning you ask the receiving party if it's okay to make the intro and that takes the onus off of them.\n\n00:56:31,030 [SPEAKER_4]\n They're not having to reject someone they don't know. And also I think preserves the relationship. So I'd love to hear from others. Just open it up. And, you know, I got some positive feedback on my thread. And I also got people pushing back. I think they thought. There was a perception that it's like, oh, you're too busy to take these connections. But I think the point is really. That there's a way to do this and be effective and build and strengthen your network, and there's a way to do this where it actually hurts your network.\n\n00:57:01,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I'll open it up and see if anybody wants to comment.\n\n00:57:10,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n Can you guys hear me?\n\n00:57:13,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n We can. We can definitely hear you. I think it's a really good question. I think a lot of it also just depends on the— you know— on the closeness of the individual asking. I mean, there's so many factors at play. Um, I do think that just specificity of, like, hey, here's what I'm looking to understand, right? Like I.\n\n00:57:36,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think your best practice example is like a very. It's a very good example, right? What can be hard is people who maybe aren't quite sure what they're looking for yet, right? They're like, ooh, I'm at like a big pharma. I'm kind of interested in like learning about small biotech and understanding like, is that something that I want to do someday? And I just like to get to know some biotech people to understand what that career path looks like. I think if you actually spell that out and make that intent clear, I think there's a lot of openness to like, sure. There can be a more open-ended discussion, right? So Daphne, I don't take your advice to mean that you have to be you know, very specific about, I'm looking for a job or I'm looking for this. It doesn't need to be this. Um, you know, kind of transactional thing, I think that you can. You know, have these networking conversations that are more open-ended questions, but I think sharing the motivation can often be really helpful so that that person can really Um, direct their conversation with you.\n\n00:58:45,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n And also potentially help facilitate intros with people who may be even more relevant for them to talk with.\n\n00:58:52,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and also who might be open to that kind of more open-ended networking versus who you might want to come to with a specific request. And that's actually an important piece of it. Yeah, definitely.\n\n00:59:03,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I agree with a lot of what you said— kind of resonated.

The one thing that I find to maybe resonate a little bit more is if you get one of those, hey, I want to hear about your company or I want to hear about your career. That's certainly one way to do it. Another one that I I find a little bit more compelling is when they say something very specific. You know, we know you work at XYZ and XYZ does it. When they show an effort and an interest, or they touch on something you've done, that they double-click on that. There's some effort and some proactiveness. I think that just shows more diligence and a little bit more seriousness, and that might lead people to be more intent to take the meeting.\n\n01:00:07,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, that was actually one of the points that a lot of people who are responding to the thread said, you know, do some research. And I think that that's a really great point, because if you do a little bit more research, you're more likely to get good results. And also. That's viewed as being polite because you spent the time to really understand the person that you're asking to meet with or the person who's making the introduction.\n\n01:00:27,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n So, I think we're out of time, but I'd like to just, last comment, last question. I just heard that NASDAQ is announcing plans to move to 24-hour trading. Anybody want to comment on that? And then we'll close out the room.\n\n01:00:46,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n It sounds terrible, but shouldn't actually change too much because I would expect that what's happening overnight is probably very low volume. I'm not sure if others have a standpoint, but we currently have pre-market, post-market, right? You see stuff move around, certainly when there's a data event or something like that. Sometimes those moves can be, you know, more significant.\n\n01:01:12,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n would be surprised if we see, uh, you know, very high volume starting at, you know, three o'clock in the morning under this new, you know, under this new policy.\n\n01:01:24,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n I for one am very much looking forward to the 3 a. m. call from a client asking, 'Why is stock XXXX up 10 right now?\n\n01:01:33,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n On five shares. Well, that's when Chad GBT takes the call and answers it for you.\n\n01:01:41,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're going to put us all out of business, Aaron.\n\n01:01:43,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n I got to tell you, for me, I don't know. I kind of love innovation and technology. And I feel like. You could have argued back in this— what we all used to to meet up and you know, underneath the tree, to trade stocks and that was all, computers trading with computers. It's gonna lead to innovation. It's gonna lead to more complex.\n\n01:02:04,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n For sure. Yeah, probably going to need two Brian's Cornies at every firm, right? One in the morning, one at night. But I think that could be interesting. There'll be probably mayhem in the beginning, but things will sort out, no?\n\n01:02:18,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Hmm.\n\n01:02:20,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, well, thank you, everyone, for an excellent discussion. It was a pleasure speaking with all of you. And thanks to everyone who joined.

I'm Eric Schmidt. And my co-hosts today are Sam Fuseli and Jeroen Werber. And we are hopeful to have shortly a special guest with us, BIO's CEO, John Crowley. For more information about our hosts and our guests or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:29,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I think we are still waiting for John to join and we'll try and check in on his status. But we certainly do have a lot to cover. And why don't we start with the obesity updates in the space? Sam, I know you. I've done a couple of things and it was a very eventful week for both drug development and deal flow in this sector of biotech.\n\n00:00:51,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so obviously we started Monday as you said, Eric. Um, it was one of these weeks where we just turned up in the office in London and there you go. So Novo had their Kagrisema data.\n\n00:01:05,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n For from the Redefine 2 trial. This is the follow-on from the Redefine 1. This was in obese diabetics. and share price took a major dive for reasons that I'm a little bit confused about because we already kind of expected um uh this this trial not to necessarily be a a a significant uh uh effort here so this is This is Novo's Combination of an amylin with a GLP-1, caglutide and semaglutide. and the data that they reported But as I said, something like about a 10% or 8% pressure on the share price. 12 . 6% placebo-adjusted weight loss.\n\n00:02:01,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n which seemed to us in line with what we've seen with Eli Lilly's Zeppound, which is of course not an Amelin. GLP-1 is a GLP-1 GIP. So the interesting thing, of course, is that usually you do lose some efficacy in the diabetic patient population. In the redefined one trial, which was obese patients, the data efficacy was 22 . 7% or roughly 20% placebo-adjusted. The number of patients who reached the top dose, which is one of the key things about the design of the Novo Nordisk trials, do you define one and do you define two? In that it allows patients to down-titrate again. Or not go all the way to the top dose. In redefining one, which was obesity, it was 57%. In redefined 2, I think they reached about a 62% or so of patients on the highest dose.\n\n00:03:04,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n So people always question, well, is that why the efficacy doesn't look as good as what Novo had suggested, which is what the issue is here?\n\n00:03:13,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n So that share price was down, and we are sitting here thinking, well, you've got a drug that's as good as— They're bound in this population. and previously, 20 weight loss and I'm definitely in the camp. I think Eric, you're not far— you're part of this camp that we're. We're— Wait, it's enough? In terms of talking about these percentages, 20, 25, 30%. Some of these patients are not going to feel very good at those sort of weight losses if you particularly rush them into it. And I think there's even been some talk that some of the trials that are ongoing, people are losing so much weight so quickly that they're They're not managing and they're having to dose down.\n\n00:03:56,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n That was the story that we started our Monday with, Eric.\n\n00:03:59,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n I agree with you 100%. There's just too much investment focus on singular numbers. And you can gain the system as you know, Sam, with regard to. know including female patients or more obese patients in these studies at baseline so We've got to get past that. We've got to start looking at the more subtle aspects that these products are likely to be differentiated on in the. the marketplace itself which isn't the absolute magnitude of weight loss but things like convenience and tolerability and safety. So great, great summary there. Thank you. Actually, I think before we we get to the deal flow in obesity, maybe we'll We'll welcome John Crowley. John, can you hear us?\n\n00:04:36,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, I can. Hi, thanks for having me again.","char_start":0,"char_end":4146,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Hi, thanks for having me again.\n\n00:04:38,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you for for being on. For those of you who don't know John, he's President and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (Bio). Of course, he's a long-time executive, having been a founder and CEO at Amicus Therapeutics. The company focused on the treatment of rare diseases, which he led for really almost two decades and had tremendous success. John, thank you again for for joining us. We're thrilled, I think. Your own Sam and I are all very keen to sort of just get your top line thoughts of where we are, what Bio is trying to do in this. Sort of tumultuous geopolitical environment and how things are going in Washington.\n\n00:05:18,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, Eric, thank you again for having me on. And again, I think pretty timely given where we are here. I thought, in kind of my upfront comments, just frame it. From a big picture standpoint, kind of where we are. Why I am optimistic that we are going to have a more favorable policy environment for biotechnology than we've had in some time. And I'll give you some specific data points. Around that. I'll also just touch on what the threats are. and how we're working through and trying to manage those threats, and then also talk about some specific opportunities. And then I'll maybe just conclude with just. our priorities at Bayo. So if that's okay, let me go ahead and start. Again, I do believe that on balance, there are more positive opportunities. Then there are negative ones for biotech. And I know, believe me, I know how hard this has been for four plus years in this environment. I was down at an investment conference earlier this week in Miami, and there were a couple hundred investors, hedge fund managers, mutual fund managers.\n\n00:06:20,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n I understand how difficult the pressures are in biotechnology, and some of them are structural. And that's where I do think we have a unique opportunity to begin to address this broad ecosystem. Because at the end of the day, one of the, you know, one of our great challenges has been the system has evolved to the point. We're developing medicines.\n\n00:06:40,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n It just takes too long, costs way too much money. is inconsistent even within therapeutic areas. It is uncertain. We need a system that provides certainty faster. And oftentimes more clearly. Positive or negative, so we could decide to advance an asset or move on. So one of the fundamental kinds of premises, if you will, that we've been working on with the administration, with policymakers, with lawmakers, is to have them understand why they need to care about biotechnology, why it's so important. And I can tell you there is a strong consensus, bipartisan, that biotechnology is a critical strategic asset for the United States. And I mentioned this before, but I'll say it again, that the world and everyone living in the world—the world is a better, safer, more prosperous, and healthier place. When we and our allies lead in biotechnology, realizing that it is a global ecosystem and countries like China will continue to play an important part of that ecosystem.\n\n00:07:45,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n But we have to be the leader. That view is widely held in the administration, from the president to RFK, to other senior leaders. in the administration, but also on Capitol Hill among Democrats and Republicans. And what we continue to emphasize in every discussion is you start with that as the basic premise. And that you need to care about biotechnology for the public health, as an engine of economic growth, and for our national security. Those points really ring true. Let me just give you a couple of data points. And believe me, look, I get all the uncertainty, the chaos, and trying to manage through all of that. I think an excellent board meeting. With the Bio Board in New York back in February, and we touched directly on this. And my view was, and the view of other speakers, that our view is that— You need to distinguish between what are trial balloons, what is rhetoric, what are extemporaneous comments, what are even executive orders.","char_start":3848,"char_end":8250,"start_time":"00:04:36","end_time":null}

They may be withdrawn. They may be blocked by the courts.\n\n00:08:55,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n And then what is actual policy? And then we need to marry that against what are our handful or two of key priorities. And there's some many times that we're having these discussions behind closed doors and many times we have and will. Rise them to a public level. As well, so just just a couple of data points on why I'm increasingly optimistic, mindful of all the challenges and uncertainty. And actually, you know, in many areas, being a hopefully. For bio to be a strong voice for the things that we care about. First, I'll begin with the FDA.\n\n00:09:29,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n My almost singular focus. Toward the back end of February when there was so much uncertainty and so many threats. To the workforce, the culture, the stability of the FDA. Was to figure who are the influencers here. Where are the centers of gravity and who are the decision makers? And this is a bit of the art of advocacy. And this was all done behind closed doors, but I can assure you very intensely. So that people at the White House, at HHS, people within the FDA understood the critical importance of the FDA, and that we need a strong FDA. It needs to be reformed and modernized, advanced. We need to implement very boldly. Bold ideas. And I will tell you, leadership of the FDA would welcome that. I think Marty, Dr. McCurry coming into the FDA, I know welcomes that as well. We made a lot of progress.\n\n00:10:18,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n And you saw, too, when I put that piece, if many of you may have seen it in stat two weeks ago.\n\n00:10:24,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n Relaying the president's State of the Union from eight years ago in our meeting in the Oval Office, his comments at that speech, and in some forums. Afterwards, talking about the importance of newer and better medicines and addressing redundancies and bureaucracies in the regulatory process. In fact, even beyond that to the clinical trial paradigm.\n\n00:10:47,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n People are increasingly aligned around that. We've had very serious conversations with the right decision makers. There will be change at the FDA. Our job is to make sure that we advocate strongly and fiercely for positive change at the FDA.\n\n00:11:03,049 [SPEAKER_1]\n So we've made progress. I think we've stopped some of the bad ideas that were in motion. And you know, right now, I know the FDA, like other government agencies, are coming up with what I know will be thoughtful plans for reimagining the FDA. But we need to make sure we're strengthening the workforce and protecting some key leaders. At the FDA as well.\n\n00:11:25,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know what? Another. Another data, just a couple more data points here too. One is on RFK. Now that Secretary Kennedy is in the seat, we've all followed closely the measles outbreak. Bio continues to be a strong advocate for the importance of vaccines. We have a very large campaign that we're going to be launching shortly. To inspire people, educate people, and frankly frighten them. If we don't have vaccines, and again, this gets to the broader issue of trust. In data and trust in science, data is on our side here, and we'll use that. So I do think this is one of the great risks in this environment that we have to be a strong voice for, engaging in many forums, privately, but now increasingly publicly as well. But I will stay with this measles outbreak. There was an interview that RFK Jr. did the other night with What's his face? Sean Hannity on Fox News.\n\n00:12:20,189 [SPEAKER_1]\n And again, I don't watch a lot of cable news, but I wanted to listen to this. And I heard maybe. For the first time that RFK specifically said with respect to measles. He encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated. Not encouraged to talk to their doctors, encouraged to get them vaccinated.","char_start":7950,"char_end":12164,"start_time":"00:08:49","end_time":null}

Not encouraged to talk to their doctors, encouraged to get them vaccinated.\n\n00:12:39,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think a step, hopefully, in the right direction, but just one data point. I will also point to the Secretary Kennedy also held a roundtable with leaders in the stem cell field. You may have seen that reported today to talk about how do we break down regulatory barriers to advance stem cell research.\n\n00:12:57,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I think that's a positive step forward. Another data point I'll give is you may have seen, also, HHS put out earlier this week a further buyout offer for all employees, a $25,000 one-time payment if they agreed it was. resign their position. The only groups that were exempted from that were FDA inspectors and reviewers. And I think that reflects an acknowledgement of the important role that FDA and a strong FDA workforce play. We saw the withdrawal of the nominee for CDC at the last hour yesterday.\n\n00:13:32,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that came directly from the White House.\n\n00:13:35,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n The um Other data point I'll provide in the last one before I just talk briefly about some threats and opportunities is the president's joint address to Congress a week ago. It was the longest State of the Union or joint address in at least modern history.\n\n00:13:53,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n The president talked about a lot of things. In that speech.\n\n00:13:58,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n The one thing that we'd never heard drug prices. We didn't hear about evil pharmaceutical companies. I'd encourage you to compare that to prior states of the union. This was very different and this was not by accident. I think it reflects, again, a view of the increased importance the biotechnology and biopharma industry. So some small data points, I think, some more significant ones, but I am sensing that there is a much more positive environment. From a policy standpoint.\n\n00:14:30,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n With that said, there are threats. I think our most significant threats, again, I mentioned vaccines. We've got to get back the trust. Again, this tends to be a very state issue. Um and we're focused in particular states but again the data is our friend and we're working to build key stakeholders, community of interest, advanced data. Build our relationships, particularly at the state level. And again, I think there are more or at least as many threats and opportunities in the states as there are in the federal government.\n\n00:15:00,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Beyond that is MFN. Index pricing.\n\n00:15:03,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Most favored nation that the president still believes. That I think we've evolved the conversation even before the election. To where he's of the point of view and the administration's of the point of view. It's not that Americans pay too much for drugs. It's that other countries pay too little. Kind of a NATO analogy, if you will. Now, how we solve for that, I think the first principle is that It's not gonna go away. There has to be a constructive conversation. We have to be thoughtful. And proactive in policy solutions here. And I think it ties into another threat, and that's, of course, everything going on with tariffs as well. Bio just completed an industry survey we had sent out. We're just now finalizing going through the raw data over the last couple of days.\n\n00:15:50,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n But probably not surprisingly, I think some of the key takeaways are going to be that. Uh, you know, significant tariffs on our industry will harm access to medicines. Could potentially raise the prices of medicines. Intentionally or unintentionally. And it also will highlight just how dependent we are on an overseas supply chain, particularly in Europe. So those are some major threats that we have to continue to be deeply engaged in and to shape in a way in which they don't harm the innovation environment for access and perhaps also tie into some other key opportunities.","char_start":11864,"char_end":16005,"start_time":"00:12:39","end_time":null}

We came very close to it, of course, in December, and that whole bill kind of blew up for a whole other reasons, well beyond PBMs. But there is a strong sense in the White House that there are inefficiencies in the system, that the middlemen, or the middles, as President Trump refers to it, as are not advancing the interests of patients, the economy, or the public health. So we're getting a really good series of conversations continuing there.\n\n00:17:06,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, what legislative vehicle that could be put into place, could some of that be done by executive order, even perhaps is something we, pharma and others, are exploring.\n\n00:17:15,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n I do think we'll at least have serious discussions, negotiations, and hearings on fixing the IRA.\n\n00:17:23,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n And the two parts that we're focused on are the orphan part of it with orphan cures, that's now been reintroduced in this new Congress, as has the EPIC Act, EPIC and MINI together, on the disparity, the pill penalty on 9 versus 13. And this is also I'll highlight where. This is a more favorable Congress for us as well. You no longer have Bernie Sanders as chair of the HELP Committee. You have Dr. Bill Cassidy on the Senate side. On the House side, you have Chairman Guthrie, Congressman Guthrie from Kentucky, a West Point grad. We know Congressman Guthrie quite well. He is a strong champion for our industry, for innovation, for patients, as is the Health Chair Subcommittee. A pharmacist by training, Buddy Carter from Georgia.\n\n00:18:14,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Also aligns, I think, with the way that we see the world. So, I would expect that we will, in the months ahead, into the summer. I have hearings on the dangerous impact that we're seeing. The dislocation of resources. Because of these mistakes in the IRA that need to get fixed. Nine versus 13, of course, a much heavier lift than orphan financially. And again, this will be part, I think, of a broader discussion, negotiation. We and Pharma and others are coming up with ideas for what the pay-fors would be.\n\n00:18:44,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n Other acute near-term opportunities we're going to see significant. Tax law work coming forward. And this is where Speaker Johnson's got a really tough needle to thread. He literally has a one-seat margin on this. There's going to be an awful lot of lobbying and advocacy from every industry you can imagine when it comes to this tax law. So for us, things like the R&D tax credit, perhaps even the orphan tax credit, and potentially also tied into the. encouraging a renaissance of manufacturing. Here in the United States, that tax law, I think that'll be a very important vehicle for that.\n\n00:19:24,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Another opportunity that we continue to work through and is really frustrating is the priority review voucher. In the pediatric diseases.\n\n00:19:32,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Again, we almost had this in the December bill. There was some opposition, but we were able to move it through bipartisan.\n\n00:19:39,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's not going to be in this continuing resolution now that it looks like the Senate will take up and move forward today.\n\n00:19:47,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n There are other vehicles into the spring. That we, with the advocacy community and pediatric cancer and pediatric rare diseases, are working on. That has to get done. And there is very, very strong bipartisan support for it. It's almost like the perfect program. Encouraging resources into some of the rarest of diseases that affect children, again, cancers, metabolic disorders, and it doesn't cost the government a dime.\n\n00:20:13,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Other, you know, are more intermediate priorities.","char_start":15705,"char_end":19867,"start_time":"00:16:28","end_time":null}

I think that's going to be in women's health. We have to address the disparities in women's health. When two-thirds of Alzheimer's cases, 80% of autoimmune diseases, and when there are very very differing impacts in cardiovascular disease for women. We've been underinvested there tremendously. And as an industry, we've not had the focus that we need to. So we need to think about incentives programs that will drive more research for women's health. Secondly, cell and gene therapy, where in many ways the entire model is broken. A third is intellectual property. And fourth is vaccines. And what we're doing at Bio. is putting together task forces and I'll be a co-chair of the task forces. Each will also have two co-chairs from our board of directors. And we'll. We'll have formal meetings. We'll define our remit. All then to be able to, at the guidance of the board, in our membership, be able to allocate specific resources to programs, again, aligning our policy, our advocacy, our communications.\n\n00:21:28,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n But these are areas, again, where they're like intellectual property, for instance, vaccines. Unique threats in other areas where, kind of, now is the time. And this, I think, rises to be an important priority for bio.\n\n00:21:42,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll just conclude with, and then happy to take any questions, Eric and Jeroen. And others. The, uh. On the strategic initiatives again, putting them in the buckets of innovation and access. For innovation, a number of different initiatives and strategic, our view is this is a multi-year effort, hopefully within this administration, but perhaps even beyond. But critically important for big, bold ideas to shape the ecosystem. And in some cases, I think we could have early wins here as well. The first is reinsuring, the renaissance of manufacturing. And we continue to advocate at BIO that, yes, this needs to be anchored in the United States, but we need to think about this more broadly among our allies. So, for instance, tomorrow morning, I'm leaving with a number of BIO staff and a number of CEOs on our board and senior executives to go to Japan for five days. And we have meetings at this most senior levels of government in Japan on the health side, on the industrial and manufacturing and economic side.\n\n00:22:46,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n We're meeting patient groups. We're meeting with the PMDA, the Japanese FDA equivalent, talking about strengthening our ties with Japan, including on the manufacturing side. So I think there's some real opportunities.\n\n00:22:59,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n To put in policies and programs here in a number of different vehicles. That will drive private capital toward a renaissance of manufacturing. And we'll have more on the actual policies of that coming out soon. The other important part on innovation is going to be reimagining again the FDA and the clinical trial paradigm. There is a real appetite to do that in the administration. Again, we continue to advocate for a very strategic, very thoughtful approach. And I know Dr. Macari coming in as FDA commissioner is strongly supportive of that as well. And I'll be coming back to you guys for ideas. On what that would be, that we could take back to FDA and to the administration. And by you guys, I mean certainly everybody on this call, but also broadly. In our entire biotech ecosystem.\n\n00:23:48,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n And then on the access side. You know, for us, know again, identifying breaking down the barriers, why do people go without their medicines and be they economic reasons, out of pocket costs, or increasingly insurance practices.

And when we look at these prior authorizations, step edits, the broad utilization management. And it's certainly within the Medicare Advantage programs, but it's well beyond that into the private insurance market. We've got to take that head on. And so these are big, big bold issues that we're going to be working with. So. That's my comments up front. Happy to take any questions.\n\n00:24:49,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, thank you for all those updates, John. It's great to hear your optimism. I think we need a little bit of that in biotech and also the fact that bio has quite a bit of influence behind the scenes. I know Sam and Yaron are going to want to chime in here. Let me just start with one question, which is this: period of chaos and uncertainty that we've been dealing with. As you well know, there's nothing investors like. Less than chaos and uncertainty, and you kind of make the point that, um, you know, we need to sort of separate the wheat from the chaff. There's some policy, there's some extraneous stuff from from where most of us sit that's hard to It's hard to know what the administration may or may not mean when it floats these trial balloons. Yeah, how is this going to play out? Are we going to need to get just a little bit less attuned to what's happening in Washington in these early days of the administration, or might things change in a way that's more helpful for us?\n\n00:25:41,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, Eric, I would encourage you to stay very attuned to what's happening in Washington because this policy environment is so critically important. You know, 25 years ago when I came into biotech, I didn't pay attention to policy at all. I cared about science, technology, scouring the world for finding ideas for some of these rare diseases. Now there's so many ideas, so many tools, technologies.\n\n00:26:03,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n But most of our challenges now are manmade. Uh, you know, be they on basic research funding again, and we do advocate—I want to emphasize this virtuous circle of innovation that we talked about, I talked about my first day on the job a year ago at biotech, looking at every part of that circle of what it takes to make newer and better medicines, always beginning at our academic research centers. And the NIH is an incredible strategic advantage, and we need to continue to invest there. We've emphasized a lot of that behind the scenes. You'll see more of it now publicly. Ahead as well. But again, you got to kind of separate the wheat from the chaff here and what's actually happening. And again, I refer back to what wasn't said. That was very significant that the president had an almost two-hour State of the Union. And never mentioned drug prices. Even in passing, never railed on evil pharmaceutical companies. So I'd encourage you to think about what's not being said. As well. There's one other data point I'll provide.\n\n00:27:01,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n First week in April, the week of April 7th, will be a very important week. I'd mentioned before that Congress from time to time. Authorizes these multi-year national security commissions. They've done it with cyber, with AI. Um, They're doing it now. A couple of years ago, they instituted [formed] a commission: the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.\n\n00:27:27,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n And their report is going to come out. And we've been very, very closely working with them, particularly over the last year, as we've emphasized. The critical importance of biotech for our national security. And I think you'll see these will be very specific policy proposals.","char_start":23732,"char_end":27740,"start_time":"00:24:16","end_time":null}

And I think you'll see these will be very specific policy proposals.\n\n00:27:43,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Around manufacturing, around the FDA, around clinical trials, looking at a whole bunch of areas where we can break down barriers, I think it'd be very, very favorable for our industry. And there'll be a lot of, hopefully, media and attention around that. I would really encourage you to look at that report. Because these reports don't sit on a shelf. They are implemented. Senator Todd Young. of Indiana, as chairman, of the commission, and he and Senator Padilla from California and others take this very very seriously. We have private industry folks like Eric Schmidt involved and others. This will be a very important and very serious report. So when we see something of prominence like that coming out of Washington, now it's coming from Congress, but it goes directly to the White House. And now the job is to take those policy recommendations and find the vehicles to implement them over the next year or so. So, yes, you've got to, again, think about what's rhetoric, what's trial balloons, what are executive orders that aren't really going to go anywhere or be stopped.\n\n00:28:44,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n And what's most important. Where are the threats? Where are the opportunities? And you got to prioritize.\n\n00:28:53,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n John, it's Sam here. I'm sitting on the other side of the world to the United States. So this is all something that's a lot harder for us to keep. Eye on because you obviously see it through the lens of other media, etc. But first, I wanted to add to Eric saying, 'Thank God you're here because your optimism is that we've all needed, given the state of the sector.' But let me just throw a couple of things at you. I've just been talking to somebody from the CDC, and it was one of those folks who was let go and then rehired. And they've also got a situation where I think there's a lot of people who are wanting to leave, partly because they don't want to be involved in doing a a study looking at vaccines and autism, which is something that I think a lot of them in their professional opinion. Is settled, so there are these elements that are still ongoing and then you've got the antis— the feeling of what looks like anti-science from this side at least.\n\n00:29:55,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I may be completely wrong and I've heard everything you said. But you still have confidence that these are things that are not going to be an issue in the long term and that science is going to prevail?\n\n00:30:09,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n I do. And again, I think it's perhaps misplaced. To say that there is an anti-science view in the administration. And all the challenges you point out are absolutely right. And those are ones that we push back on very hard. There is no question that there is no link between autism and vaccines. You know, we were pleased to hear Dr. McCary in his hearing said that point blank. We hadn't heard that in a prior hearing. Um, so those are things that we need to be incredibly vigilant and engaged on. And when we see anti-science views or areas that undermine the public trust in science, technology, and leadership, we need to be really vocal about that. And sometimes it's very vocal privately. You know, this all isn't going to be fought by press releases and clever commercials. And those tend to be the most persuasive discussions I find. But at times it does need to rise to a higher level. I you know, when I wrote that piece, instead and it came out two weeks ago. None of that was a surprise to lawmakers, policymakers at the White House, HHS, anywhere.\n\n00:31:15,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n They've heard all of that from me and from others. Um, This was going on the record and framing it in a very public way, but also it was directed to other stakeholders, including You know, you guys, our companies, our community. And, for instance, the workforce at the FDA. We have emphasized repeatedly. Um, to doge that You can't go in with a wrecking ball. You lose key people, you lose key talent. It's not going to be, well, we'll make mistakes and we'll fix it down the road. No, you're going to harm innovation.","char_start":27440,"char_end":31837,"start_time":"27:27","end_time":null}

No, you're going to harm innovation.\n\n00:31:45,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're gonna harm patients. And you might as well just give the whole industry to China. You can't do it. And we've given them examples of why that doesn't work. And I think that, again, I think when you look at this buyout offer this week and the fact that FDA inspectors and reviewers were exempted. I think they get it. And there's some people who are aligned around wanting more medicines and wanting a successful biotech industry. Not without its challenges, not without its opposition, but That's kind of our job to manage and balance that on behalf of the industry.\n\n00:32:17,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n So again, I wouldn't say I was wholly enthusiastically positive. I said unbalanced. I believe there are more positive opportunities than there are threats, but there are threats.\n\n00:32:28,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n John, it's um, it's your own and and again, thanks always always great to hear from you um, so I'm actually going to ask a question about China because we've discussed in the show many times right. The innovation now that's coming out of China and where IP and drugs are now getting founded, but they're actually coming here more for development and commercialization, which is another you know uh avenue of innovation. I think some some view it as a threat but um along with that obviously there's a common question of what is biosecure really to mean. What about manufacturing and of course there's biosecure kind of broadly on this industry. I think many of us thought that it was a done deal you know we have a Washington research group that thought that was going to get done last year, and it didn't get done. And that was very surprising. And it did seem like there's a lot of stakeholders sort of behind the scenes that had a lot of input. And of course, you and Bayo had a lot of input. What are you expecting? And what's the timeline?\n\n00:33:25,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, Jeroen, I think it's important to realize biosecure is two things. It is a piece of legislation. And as it came out last year in a very public and forceful way. Again, our job at Bio, we perfectly aligned around the concept, the second part of biosecurity, the concept of biosecurity. The specific piece of legislation, we said we had some areas of concern. We did our survey, of course. We met privately with members of the China Select Committee, members of the intelligence community to share our thoughts and including the fact that you can't cut off access to some of these key partners, particularly the manufacturing partners. Because again, you'll slow biomedical research, you'll harm patients. and you'll actually work against. your national security interests. They listened to that. They made the changes. In fact, there were so many changes to that bill. While it did pass, it wasn't overwhelming. And there are some people, and you talk to Jake Oxencloss up in Boston.\n\n00:34:25,299 [SPEAKER_1]\n Congressman Austin Claus, he'll tell you he voted against it, not because he's against the concept of biosecurity. At the end of the day, he thought the legislation was so watered down as to be ineffective.\n\n00:34:35,449 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it didn't pass. It wasn't included in the national defense authorization at the end of the year. Our view is that it's. Possible. But it's in a form right now that's largely ineffective or toothless. But increasingly unlikely that it will even become law. But what it has done is to raise again that second part of what biosecurity is, and that's the concept. Of biosecurity that it a lot of it again is grounded in supply chain resiliency. The supply chain But it's even more broad than that. It's the entire biomedical research establishment, including, of course, our industry. And what it's done is to elevate that view that, OK, that is a threat. But, you know, the mistake, I think, of the act, Biosecure Act, was to think that you're going to. You know, you're going to prohibit activities. You're going to penalize somehow investment or partnerships, the sticks, if you will. That doesn't work really well. There's some incredible science going on in China. And they're moving in.","char_start":31537,"char_end":35984,"start_time":"00:31:45","end_time":null}

And they're moving in.\n\n00:35:36,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n very, very fast. I think in some ways we've got a couple of years. Till we're at parity. or worse with China. And again, we're of the view that we need to continue and maintain our lead. as our lead in the United States, among our allies, as the critical center of excellence in biotechnology. But don't look at what you're going to do to punish China. Look at what we're going to do to break down our barriers. and to allow biotechnology to flourish. And that's when I come back to this National Security Commission report. That again, I think will be very, very positive. In changing the ecosystem for us, but a lot of this is against the backdrop of this great rivalry with China.\n\n00:36:15,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n John, thank you very much for your time. We know how busy you are. All of us at Biotech Hangout owe you a depth of gratitude for all the work you're doing.\n\n00:36:24,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n Really appreciate the time and hope to connect soon.\n\n00:36:28,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n Thank you so much, guys. Have a great day.\n\n00:36:33,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, we can. Head back to our week's worth of high activity and obesity. Did you want to touch on the two key deals that were done or not done, maybe?\n\n00:36:43,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n With the Zealand Roche transaction and then Viking going at it alone with their manufacturing contract.\n\n00:36:50,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, like the one of the things that has driven up the obesity sector, the biotechs, and obesity is the chance for women. And of course, that comes naturally because this is a game for really big companies. So there's two companies that were widely expected to have gotten acquired: one is dealing pharma out of Europe and the other one is Viking Therapeutics in the U.S. S. So earlier this week, Zealand announced a deal with Roche, uh, for uh, essentially combining the GLIP-1 injectable from Roche, which they bought, actually, as a part of the $3 billion deal of Carmat. That's a CT-388. And combine that with Petrolyntide, which is the amylin analog from Zealand. It's a 50-50 deal, huge. Upfront. I think it's $5. 6 billion altogether. Roche made a huge upfront payment that then enabled Zealand to do 50-50 for the back end of the deal.\n\n00:37:50,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n So just to give you a sense, the upfront was $1. 65 billion.\n\n00:37:55,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's a fairly sized ball. And then, they're both going to now take that into phase three studies. CT-388 from Roche looks very good. It had a 19% reduction at 24 weeks.\n\n00:38:09,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Have some dropouts, almost 12% all in between the upfront and the maintenance. And there was a high rate of nausea and vomiting. And this is sort of as they got to the high dose. So it's unclear exactly which dose they're going to take forward. Petrolentide looks good. It does look better so far than the amylin that's a part of Cagri. SEMA. It's a higher dose. It's obviously going to be more potent. So this is something very promising to watch all in. Of course, this area is getting heat up, heating up. But Zealand did come up from the bottom on the heels of this deal. But by and large, this stock is down a lot from the peak with the expectation that they're going to get acquired. Um, but at least, like, they're well capitalized and they have a good partner. The other one is Viking, and that's a small biotech, and they have an injectable GLP-1 peptide that is looking really good. And they have an oral version of it, which is facing the, that's a GLP-1 peptide with an oral delivery.","char_start":35684,"char_end":39544,"start_time":"00:35:36","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_85b3acc0f1e3_chunk_0010","doc_id":"doc_85b3acc0f1e3","order":10,"text":"t at least, like, they're well capitalized and they have a good partner.

And they have an oral version of it, which is facing the, that's a GLP-1 peptide with an oral delivery.\n\n00:39:15,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n Obviously, that's got its own. The efficacy there is not as injectable. But again, this is a company that is well capitalized. They have $900 million, but that's obviously not sufficient. Long term. And that's expected to get acquired too. Their data look good. Again, I think the big question was, you know, how are you going to develop it by yourself? So what happened this week is entered into a deal with Cordon Pharma. This is to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient they're going to pay 150 million over three years. Just to give you a sense of the volume, Cordon Pharma is going to have capacity for 100 million auto-injectors annually, 100 million syringes, and 1 billion tablets. I mean, huge volume.\n\n00:39:59,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n Now, the question—is that mean that Viking is more or less likely to get acquired? And there's still a question, then, how do you finance? So I think that that stock obviously is facing those questions and in general has also been under pressure. Either way, you do need to get API.\n\n00:40:15,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n So maybe this is another clearing event toward an acquisition or they're just going to stay it alone. But this era is going to become very competitive. You know, there's Amgen coming in. There's Metzera. There's Kylera. There's a lot going on.\n\n00:40:27,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, I know you follow all these moving parts in OBC very closely. I'd love to get your views. But I guess in particular on this acquisition question that Yerong brings up, who may or may not get acquired going forward? We've seen a couple of deals in the ambulance space, Goobra last week and now Zeeland this week. We haven't seen many deals in the GLIP1 space and we haven't seen any acquisitions. Are we kind of past peak? Frothiness in terms of what would you consider M &A at least with regard to GLP-1s and, and maybe even, you know, past acquisition windows for Amelans as well.\n\n00:41:05,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, so, Eric, I think share prices tell you that, right, to a degree when you look at it. And Viking, structured therapeutics. I'll tell you, whichever company you look at that tells you that.\n\n00:41:20,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n However, there are elements here now that have lined up in a situation where maybe not necessarily M &A. But if you have a company that's got just Amelie. Let's say a V. right, which have just entered the fray with Amelie, given that everybody is looking at these combinations of GLP-1, GIP, or GLP-1 and amyline, or whatever shape or form you like.\n\n00:41:45,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n I would say that they would need to build a pipeline here or a bigger bag for the sales folks.\n\n00:41:55,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I've been talking about this to a couple of people. If you think about the old world of SGLT2s, which is diabetes therapies, there's two drugs on the market that are very similar in terms of efficacy and side effect profile: AstraZeneca's and Lilly's. Whose is selling better? Lily. They have broader indication base, but also they have a bigger diabetes business.\n\n00:42:23,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Is that why Lily's SGLT2 GRDMs is doing better than FargZeeja? Maybe. If that is true, and I think a lot of people believe that if you have a franchise, you're better placed. Um. then someone like Abby would have to create that franchise again. Does this mean? A takeout of one of these GLP-1 companies that we've mentioned, or does it mean a licensing deal or a partnership? Possibly. Either way, I think it would be good for them, as we've seen with the share price for Zealand, even though it's sold off because everyone's now worried that that the next catalyst is whatever, a year away or a year and a half away. That's the world we live in. So that is the way I would look at it, to be honest. And I am on the side that the Viking manufacturing deal is a realistic thing, is an important thing for them to have done. A lot of people talk about the manufacturing capacity for these peptides. So they've kind of solved that problem. Either way, whether they're going it alone or with a partner, this is a problem that needed to be solved.","char_start":39244,"char_end":43671,"start_time":"00:39:15","end_time":null}

I think a lot of us would feel a lot better if the Viking asset were in a partner's hands, given you know, the inability of a smaller company like Viking to really compete on an execution standpoint. But Staying with the deal flow theme, we did see a couple of M&A transactions this week that are worth mentioning. They come again in the small cap oncology space. With SunPharma, uh, having acquired Checkpoint and Bristol Myers, Inc. (BMY) collaborated or consolidated its interest in 270Bio. That BMY270 deal, of course, comes just weeks after the other half of Bluebird is being acquired. And this all follows Jazz Chimerics. So a lot of, again, small cap oncology acquisitions. It strikes me that we'll probably see more, to be honest, because these onesies and twosies in oncology, one, two, $300 million type drug candidates. really ought to be part of a bigger oncology organization from a leverage and margin standpoint makes a lot of sense.\n\n00:44:38,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n And also because of the environment we're in, we have many small cap oncology companies, some even with marketed drugs. They're trading at or below cash. So I'd expect that type of trend to continue. But you're on one. Small cap oncology deal that we have yet to see happen is the SpringWorks Merck KGA potential acquisition. What's the latest there?\n\n00:45:02,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, I mean, the latest there is that there is no update. So for everybody listening, recall that this is a company, Springworks, Hunch Exhibio. Very successfully for Desmoy tumors. They're the only drug on the market and they beat numbers. They just got Gomecly approved. That's the Mec inhibitor for, or neurofibromatosis 1, the plexiphoid form. And the competitor there is AstraZeneca. The AstraZeneca only has a label for peds, and it's got a lot of black box issues and drug-drug interactions and safety issues. And SprimWorks got approved for both adults and pediatrics with a better label. So it should be a better product.\n\n00:45:42,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, between those two drugs, consensus is that they're going to sell a bill one to a billion and a half, and maybe the opposite— two billion. It's a $3. 8 billion dollar company. So Merck KGA put out a press release sort of toward the latter half of January saying they're in advanced discussions. As everybody knows, Merck KGA has a—vision, and neuro, and oncology, and the oncology products are actually orphan focused just like here. So it's a perfect fit. It's a big company that can— globally or. They have the capital. They have $15 billion of capital. So we all thought that this actually makes sense because we do think that Springworks wants to and needs to sell. And of course, they need to now launch the drugs globally, and they're small. Take out of Connecticut. So the deal is going to get done. The stock went up to $60 from $32 at J. P. Morgan. But it's been taking a long time. Long time. It's almost two months now. Market GA report about a week ago on the call, they really didn't say a lot other than, you know, they have 15 billion in capital.\n\n00:46:46,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n And they're focusing on healthcare and products, and in licensing. I think that was the message. And of course, SpringWorks immediately went down maybe as much, $10.\n\n00:46:58,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n in those two weeks. So we're all waiting. Management are returning calls. They're not coming to conferences.\n\n00:47:06,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n So the next big catalyst is probably when they report the first quarter in April. And if they indeed will do a conference call, I think at that point, we will think that they're probably not getting acquired imminently.\n\n00:47:20,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n But in the meantime, the stock is kind of hovering around 50. It makes a lot of sense to do a deal.\n\n00:47:26,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n We were hopeful for a deal. We're all back in watchful waiting.

Let's leave the. The transaction.\n\n00:47:44,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Discussion and deal flow discussion and turn to some data updates and maybe, you know, the highlight of the week could have been. Amgenza Plinza Uh update in um myasthenia gravis, your own. Do you want to take that one as well?\n\n00:47:57,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so this is an interesting one. And earlier this week, we actually designated Argenix as our European top pick. I think maybe for the fifth time in a row, it's obviously one of the premier companies in oncology. I'm sorry, in the biotech. Sector and certainly out of Europe, probably just along the CB.\n\n00:48:17,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n The competition here is a Plisna, which everybody knows is an antibody that depletes CD19 cells. It can be dosed twice a year. So it's really nice about it. We've seen the 26-week data at AAN. And recall, at that time, it's a slow onset of action. But at the same time, they were able to to taper off steroids, which is a big positive, and it's very safe. And so now we got the 52-week data as a late-breaker abstract. We don't have the— data. It's going to be on April 8th, but we can certainly see pretty much as expected that the curves continue to separate. So at that point, you got a dose at 26 weeks and another dose at 52 weeks and nothing in between. So you're totally off therapy, which is very nice. And the data is not quite as good as VivGuard.\n\n00:49:06,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's pretty good. I mean, the MGADL is almost the same. It's sort of negative 2. 8 versus, let's say, negative 3. The QMG, which is the secondary endpoint, is negative 4. 3. Shy of spread of VivGuard at negative five three but again it offers you a very nice option in a huge market that is very much a growth market— it's about six billion and growing right now in GMG. So we definitely think Oplinsa is going to find a role, maybe to replace C5 antagonists, because it's safer. need to get vaccinated, and it's cheaper and more convenient, or in patients that fail VivGuard, or maybe maintenance after patients get intermission. So anyway, the whole CD19 premise is not really playing out clinically.\n\n00:49:54,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n I know investors always like a good fight between two competitors in markets like this, but the number one parameter behind the success of either of these two drugs is going to be the size of the market, right? And these I &I markets, they just keep growing and growing and giving and giving. make sure you don't lose sight of the forest through the trees here.\n\n00:50:15,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let's turn our discussion over to earnings recaps. We actually had a couple of stragglers report this week in BeyondTech and Legend. Sam, did you want to give us the update from BeyondTech?\n\n00:50:27,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sure.\n\n00:50:29,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Look, they had a pretty rough week, although it was against a very difficult tape, so the results were on Monday the 10th, and they reported actually 2024 was in line, and but nobody seems to care about that. Everybody cares about the outlook, which was quite interesting because they.\n\n00:50:51,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n They guided to 2 billion euro sales. So for one, assume the euro-dollar parity, or if you want to divide by 1 .1.","char_start":47492,"char_end":51159,"start_time":"00:47:20","end_time":null}

Everybody cares about the outlook, which was quite interesting because they.\n\n00:50:51,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n They guided to 2 billion euro sales. So for one, assume the euro-dollar parity, or if you want to divide by 1 .1.\n\n00:51:02,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Two billion sales and that's against the consensus of two and a half, based on Bloomberg. So what happened here? They said at the same time and remember Pfizer. Where most of their revenue comes from— for the COVID vaccine— said that they're going to have the same revenue essentially as last year, which was about $5 billion. So why is BioNTech not getting the same revenue as last year? Well, and the volume they said is going to be similar to last year, and their assumptions are pricing and also share. Of course, what's left here is the write downs. Now, fair to be fair, to them, a few hundred million dollar write down in inventory, which happens with vaccines you manufacture and you hope that people buy it. So you don't buy it. You've got the stock. So you have to. Essentially, write it off, especially in a world where the vaccine changes every year. So this is the case here. This is the case with flu. So this is nothing against biotics. It's just the way it is.\n\n00:52:00,899 [SPEAKER_2]\n And so it's write-downs mostly. There are probably a couple of other elements, but I think that is the biggest number. Then you add all that up. And you get to a cash burn of something in the region of 1. 5 to 1. 7 billion euros for the year. On top of that, they've spent some more cash. They bought by Atheist and they've got a couple of settlements. So we think that they're going to end the year— this year, something in the region of 14 billion. Now. Why is that a problem? It's not. The reality is this is a massive cash balance, right? But you do then create a situation in that you have to somehow keep that enterprise value going up. And the only way to do that is through delivering on your pipeline, which Jeroen is going to talk about because there's a conference coming up.\n\n00:52:46,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very near term, there's some data coming. So, Jeroen, over to you.\n\n00:52:52,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and just to even give you a sense, because, you know, we got a lot of questions on BioNTech, sort of what's the worst case scenario, right? What is cash? So, Rafal, a year ago, or nine months ago, right before the famous ASCO, where PD-1's VEGF bispecifics really hit it. They had about $80 in cash.\n\n00:53:13,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm heading into this ASCO. We believe we're going to have about 60 in cash, and the stock, you know, the stock's at 100, 100 euros right now. So, the everything I mentioned by the way, zero is not dollars, so it kind of gives you a little bit of a sense where they are and why the pipeline is so important. So there's going to be— we've seen data from Summit, recall that have competing products. They showed initial survival data in lung cancer that looks good with a hazard ratio of 0. 8 in about half the events, the survival events happening. And they're going to update that in short order. That's probably going to be the most important data for the class.\n\n00:53:50,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, with BioNTech, we've seen some survival. So far in triple negative.\n\n00:53:57,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n We've seen a little bit of survival so far in non-small cell, but now we're going to see the small cell lung cancer data, and that's coming in Paris.\n\n00:54:07,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n On March 28th. So it's going to be in first line and second line. And there's going to be a lot of follow-up. So we're really going to be able to begin to tell, like, is there really a survival benefit with these drugs? We anticipate that the PFS would look good. The big question always with survival is, can you actually see a survival benefit?\n\n00:54:28,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because there isn't a great correlation between checkpoint inhibitors between PF and survival in small cells, but that's really, there's going to be a lot of data now coming between them and Summit over the next three months.\n\n00:54:44,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um. Look at the risk-reward here is getting pretty interesting to a lot of people. The stock back at 100 euros. And it's worth following that the pipeline is definitely interesting.","char_start":50859,"char_end":55213,"start_time":"00:50:51","end_time":null}

Look at the risk-reward here is getting pretty interesting to a lot of people. The stock back at 100 euros. And it's worth following that the pipeline is definitely interesting.\n\n00:54:56,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well as you say, are a number of milestones that are upcoming from these PD1 VEGF by specifics and obviously it's an enormous market where you can potentially take on a PD1 like Pembro and and show superiority to what is today the world's largest pharmaceutical. So a lot of action in the stocks for sure upcoming. Thanks for those updates. And maybe you want to take us home, Jeroen, with the update from Legend, which is obviously also another exciting and competitive marketplace.\n\n00:55:27,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so so this is where I would say the Legend of Legend, and it's it's about Corvicti, obviously the the biggest selling car T now um of any car T and certainly biggest one, obviously, in myeloma. It's a BCMA CAR T, showed a survival benefit in second line onwards in myeloma. And of course, J &J and Legend just couldn't make enough. And they're totally capacity constraint. Last year, they've now opened essentially two to three new facilities or access facilities, new expansions of current facilities. Between the two facilities in Europe, the Albulisk and TechLane in Belgium. The Raritan facility in New Jersey and Novartis is a contract manufacturer, is actually making commercial supply for them now too. So they're going to double capacity this year, let's say from just under a billion to just about 2 billion globally.\n\n00:56:21,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, And so that's this year. They're supposed to finish this year at more than 10,000 doses worth of capacity. And they've now, I think, for the first time, is really beginning to crystallize that by 27, they're going to have 20,000 to 24,000 slots. It's a huge capacity. And no one has anything close to that utilization in the models yet. Of course, we're all waiting for the frontline data because that's the really big market. As everybody remembers.\n\n00:56:53,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n 9,000 transplants in the U. S. alone annually that could be ultimately replaced by CAR-T per the data, assuming it works and do think it's going to. And now they've just announced an additional $150 million, each one of almost $300 million worth of another expansion on the Tech Lane facility. Which will come on board, I believe, in 27 slash 28. So, a huge amount of capacity. And of course, Gilead will come in with their competitors. Well. Look, I remember when we started, sadly, myeloma was a six-month sort of median survival. Now survival, we're talking about 10 years, you know, in some cases. So thank God there's going to be a lot of really good therapies and capacities ramping up quickly, which is good to see.\n\n00:57:46,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, your last comment really makes everything that John said earlier in our discussion ring so true. It's so critical that the US.\n\n00:57:54,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n Gets this right from not just a national security but public health standpoint, so Sam, Yaron, always wonderful to share the microphone with you guys. Thank you for your insights. We are out of time.

I'm Sanford Ali and my co-hosts today are Eric Schmidt, Brian Scorny, and Matt Klein.\n\n00:00:16,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n Special special guest mat plan. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:29,169 [SPEAKER_2]\n So we're going to start the conversation today with the discussion about HIV funding, etc. So we heard the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, was weighing plans to cut federal government funding for domestic HIV funding.\n\n00:00:50,619 [SPEAKER_2]\n Ex-US funding with USAID has been already impacted across the board, but here is now coming home. That would be quite interesting if this is true and share prices of a couple of companies that are involved in the HIV space did get hit. Brian, do you mind walking us through what your take on this is and how you think about the whole story and whether it's warranted that some share prices weaken on it?\n\n00:01:17,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n yeah sure thanks sam so yeah i mean it's uh um the the new administration obviously um there's big x factor across many things and You know, what I hear from investors across the board is just the uncertainty of the introduction of the new Trump administration, RFK Jr., secretary of HHS. Um, just that there's a lot of questions as to, you know, what direction is the administration going to take in numerous things. I think there's some things that people are clearly concerned about, but, like, the vaccine side of the story. Others that are people are just questioning. But, you know, one of the things that I found really interesting, and you know, I cover Gillette every time I've kind of seen them in the last few months, post Trump's win, and I kind of The question to them of, you know, what are they hearing from the administration in terms of HIV funding and in particular, HIV prevention fund? And this is really important because Gilead has had an enormous move over the last year.\n\n00:02:17,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I would say that's very much largely due to enthusiasm around fair twice yearly.\n\n00:02:25,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n prevention lenacapavir. The data from their phase three studies have looked really good, effectively superior to the prep options that are out there. Right now, Truvada or Descovy. And really, you know, one of the major reasons— not only is it a very effective drug prevention, but it's— It's really sort of a forced compliance of two injections per year versus taking the drug on a daily basis, as in the case of Tiscovi.\n\n00:02:55,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n Across the studies, where if patients are non-compliant and they're high-risk patients, you see a breakthrough of patients getting HIV. The very, very high efficacy that we've seen with twice annual lenacapivir, the convenience of just going in and getting a quick injection once every six months. There's a lot of enthusiasm. This is going to be a really big launch. If you look at ConsenSys right now, just in 2030, ConsenSys has Lenacapivir prep at about $4 billion and growing very substantially after that versus about $2 billion that they currently do for Descovy prep. So this is really kind of the big growth driver for Gilead. But the question winds up being, how committed is this administration to HIV prevention? Obviously, there's a lot of questions around how the CDC is going to issue recommendations or change recommendations. Obviously, vaccines have a lot of controversy as to what the CDC is going to do and how.\n\n00:03:57,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n How significant the recommendations that they have right now will be maintained. But, you know, there's commentary historically from RFK Jr. that, you know, isn't exactly super pro-HIV prevention.","char_start":0,"char_end":3910,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_6407e054e017_chunk_0001","doc_id":"doc_6407e054e017","order":1,"text":"accines have a lot of controversy as to what the CDC is going to do and how.\n\n00:03:57,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n How significant the recommendations that they have right now will be maintained. But, you know, there's commentary historically from RFK Jr. that, you know, isn't exactly super pro-HIV prevention.\n\n00:04:12,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n One has to wonder, will they have the same level of commitment? So look, I think the Wall Street Journal report said that HHS was looking to substantially cut HIV and other prevention efforts right now. Right now, the CDC spends about $1. 3 billion on HIV prevention each year. But on top of that is sort of the policies that drive much more substantial amounts of funding, not just in terms of Medicaid and Medicare, but also the guidelines and recommendations that have downstream effects on payers, too. That came out Tuesday night. Wednesday, there are already people from the Trump administration sort of walking that back. But I think it sort of opened up the people's eyes to the idea of, oh, you know.\n\n00:04:56,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Here is somewhere where the Trump administration can have an impact. And we really have to have a clear understanding of what that impact, if any, is going to be, you know, with all the efforts Doge has had, with all the efforts that RFK Jr. has had. I understand Weldon is no longer being positioned for director of CDC, but there were a lot of concerns that some of the public things that he said, across the board, would be very concerning for future funding and future recommendations of programs such as this. And that's why I think Gilead took a little bit of a hit. It has been trading down basically since that Tuesday announcement.\n\n00:05:33,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, it was the surprise— some people, anyway— great stock in the biotech space, having been a laggard in terms of performance for some years, I would say. So it's a pity that policy gets in the way of what is clearly good for patients. And now on that same front. Um, I mean, you know, the um advisory committee for uh on immunization practices, asip, is uh was there wasn't a a um meeting that was expected on the 26th and 28th to 28th of February, which is the one at which they would have discussed flu vaccines.\n\n00:06:20,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n etc and that was cancelled. and also, I don't know if you want to call this a walk back, but it's back on the agenda. We just had the announcement that's going to be on the 15th and 16th of April. Um, and of course, there's no agenda yet, but it seems like the topics that they're going to be talking about are the same as the ones that were previously scheduled. These include: The discussion on flu vaccines and the effectiveness of the vaccine program this year or last year. A discussion on RSV drug clisrovimab, which is a potential competitor to nirsevimab and this one is from Merck and the other one's from Sanofi-Astrazeneca, and then of course you've got um a conversation on on respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, RSV vaccines, Moderna and GSK. They're both looking for approval of 18 to discuss. The data for the 18 to 59 year olds. I mean, we don't believe that it's likely that ACIP will change its view and vote in favor of expanding to this group.\n\n00:07:23,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's really no need for them— is the view that I think a lot of people hold. So they've already reduced use in under 70s.\n\n00:07:32,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n And they talk about clarified use, not necessarily wanting it to be reduced, but that's what they've done. And there's going to be a discussion of the new Moderna COVID shot. And of course, an interesting discussion on CMV. That would be quite a cytomegalovirus. Good to have to see what the ACIP thinks of cytomegalovirus in general, because Moderna does have a vaccine that we're all waiting for the data on. A phase three trial and a CMV vaccine. So the conversation at ACIP may help us bracket where the expectations could be from, perhaps a commercial angle or at least clinical data expectations, et cetera. There.\n\n00:08:17,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that's all we had on policy. Unless anybody, Matt or Eric, if you wanted to jump in or add anything to what we just said, or Brian, any other topics that I've missed on that front?\n\n00:08:29,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, Sam, I mean, thank God we only have one topic on policy.

This is just a wonderful turn of events in the last six to eight weeks here.\n\n00:08:38,179 [SPEAKER_2]\n I did think about adding a whole bunch, but because you can, right? It's not a— but then it just gets a bit depressing. I mean, you don't really want to keep doing that.\n\n00:08:48,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. So we're going to go to data. And of course, Matt is here. So we're going to have to talk about the data for.\n\n00:09:00,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n Batoclimab, have I pronounced that correctly? Bato is the easiest way to put it on. So Matt, why don't you just walk us through the conversation, just the announcement, the data. and your decision to clearly move to the next product, and how you want to think about setting this up as a commercial success at some point in the future, hopefully, against what you could call a well-entrenched VivGuard, at least by then anyway. So, the floor is yours.\n\n00:09:28,680 [SPEAKER_3]\n Perfect. Can you hear me okay? Just making sure.\n\n00:09:30,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. We're loud and clear.\n\n00:09:32,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thanks for having me. Actually, confession for the field, which is I was invited to do this before anyone else knew the data was coming out. And to be sort of a general commentator. And I was like, this seems like a convenient week because I obviously knew it was coming. This is dope. I'll answer all those questions. I had just like one inside baseball sort of. Anecdote that I thought was interesting before I actually talk about the immune event data. Which is actually just about like. biotech public equity market structure.\n\n00:09:59,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Which is, So we asked this data on Wednesday morning. And the thing that companies do when they announce data that the market cares about is you email all your investors and go out. And then you wind up filling your day with meetings. It's actually, it's kind of a fun day in the sense that, you get to tell your story. You get to get a lot of feedback. I learn a lot in these meetings. Investors have thoughts on what we should do and what the competitors are saying and what the chatter is. And it's like a really busy day. So we did 25 meetings on Wednesday. And one of the things interesting. So Immunovant is a very heavily shorted stock. This was a very controversial 20% of the float was short. Probably one of the more shorted stocks in the index.\n\n00:10:41,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n This sort of. General consensus on this stuff is that a lot of those shorts are sort of what I call pod funds, which are these like. for those that aren't sort of close to it, these groups of investors who work. as sort of a unit at an enterprise like Citadel or Millennium. And they're on a short leash and they run what's called market neutral. So they're short about as much as they're long. They're betting against. As many stocks as they're betting on and pod funds get a lot of reputation in the current market for being the sort of prime movers of stock up and down. Against the backdrop of market volatility.\n\n00:11:14,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n So anyway, we did 25 of these meetings, as I said. On Wednesday and I'm curious. And who got Aaron and Eric and Brian on like. What percentage of those 25 meetings, right? Immune event, very heavily shorted stock. Todd's certainly heavily involved with it. What percentage of those 25 meetings would you guess were pods?\n\n00:11:32,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n Certainly more than 50, if you agreed to take more than 50% of them.\n\n00:11:39,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, I would go lower. I was going to say 25%.\n\n00:11:42,280 [SPEAKER_3]\n So. I'll tell you the number. The number is zero.\n\n00:11:46,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n Zero pods took a meeting.\n\n00:11:48,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Which I thought was really interesting. It's not like we turned them down. Basically, zero pods asked for a meeting. And the reason I believe that zero pods ask for a meeting is they didn't care what I had to say about the data.","char_start":7742,"char_end":11880,"start_time":"00:08:29","end_time":null}

And the reason I believe that zero pods ask for a meeting is they didn't care what I had to say about the data.\n\n00:12:01,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right. They were positioned short in many cases. It was a short that fit with their overall strategy. I don't begrudge anyone this. This is their business model. But it was just this super interesting moment for me of like, 'Yeah, they're not looking for my opinion on whether this data is good or bad.' They have a position, they have a setup as a fund, and they were going to run with that position. And the market didn't blow up their short. And so, they sort of continue to operate. And this was an interesting experience for me. Because you want ideally like equity research analysts who took our calls. We got ones who love the data. We got ones who push back on the data. Like, you have a discussion with all sides, but most of the funds who took the calls were pretty positively inclined on Immunovant, whether they held the stock or not. and we're sort of giving constructive feedback, and the whole side of the market that was betting against us just sort of skipped it. And it's interesting as a company because it makes it very hard to sort of position and figure out what to do. You don't get that feedback. You don't sort of understand what's going on. And frankly, you feel a little bit like. whatever, like the object of a prop bet at the Super Bowl where What you're doing is a little bit beside the point for the business of the people trading the stock.\n\n00:13:09,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it was just like an interesting reflection on. on the day that we put the data out.\n\n00:13:14,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n This is fascinating to me, Matt. I mean, you're right that it speaks to the market structure that we have right now and maybe whether it's broken or not, which is a topic that we've been discussing a lot at Cantor. I also wonder if, because the event has happened and you were speaking to folks after the data came out, whether know they've just played you as you say for this event, and whether they were short or long event's now over and they're on to the next. We often find that there's this short-termism in the marketplace where, all a pawn shop investor cares about, is the next milestone.\n\n00:13:47,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n Whether they made or lost money on Immunobant this week, perhaps they'll run to the next.\n\n00:13:52,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, totally possible.\n\n00:13:55,269 [SPEAKER_3]\n Totally possible. It was not at all, like I expected that morning. I was like, 'Okay, I'm gearing up for battle. We're on the ground. Shields and swords and whatever, and like we're gonna have the conversation And then the starkness of, like, literally zero. Literally zero of our detractors speaking to me. That was. was an interesting moment.\n\n00:14:15,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Anyway, unless there was anything else to say on that, I'll skip to the data now, but I just thought that was like an interesting. Well, maybe that's a pretty good term.\n\n00:14:22,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's call it anecdote, but it is pretty good because it's nice and fresh. Yeah.\n\n00:14:27,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n So on the data itself, so look the setup here— which again, some people may be familiar with, some aren't— is there's this very promising, successful class of drugs called anti-FCR and antibodies.\n\n00:14:40,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n They work by affecting the rate at which the body recycles a particular category of antibodies called IgG antibodies.\n\n00:14:48,060 [SPEAKER_3]\n And if you inhibit the IgG binding domain of what's called the neonatal FC receptor, you lower the overall level of IgG antibodies in the body, which could, in theory, make you more prone to illness and things. In practice, we've seen very little of that down to quite deep levels of suppression of IgG. But what it does do is.\n\n00:15:08,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n There are a bunch of diseases that are autoimmune diseases where the body produces IgG autoantibodies to some form of self. If those antibodies are to the neuromuscular junction, it's called myasthenia gravis, and it has neuromuscular symptoms. If they're to the thyroid, it's called Graves disease and thyroid-related symptoms and ultimately thyroid eye disease. And so on.","char_start":11580,"char_end":15991,"start_time":"00:11:48","end_time":null}

If those antibodies are to the neuromuscular junction, it's called myasthenia gravis, and it has neuromuscular symptoms. If they're to the thyroid, it's called Graves disease and thyroid-related symptoms and ultimately thyroid eye disease. And so on.\n\n00:15:28,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n The undisputed leader in this field right now is going to call our Gen X that has a $40 billion market cap or something and a very successful drug called F-cartigimide. That has launched in both myasthenia gravis and CIDP.\n\n00:15:43,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n And so we have a next-generation anti-epidemic antibody. We actually have a couple of them, which is relevant for this discussion. But they're both. What I would call next-generation in that they achieve a couple of things that F. Cartesima doesn't. One, sort of boring, which is important to patients. But they're formulatable in a well-concentrated, relatively low-dose subcutaneous injection. So a very normal shot of the, I think it's literally maybe the same device. As Cosentix, for example. And then the other thing that they both do. is they both suppress IgG more deeply in our studies generally than we see with F-cartesimide. F-cartesimide usually expresses IgG. Kind of the mid 60s. Every now and then you have a study that's a little higher, a little lower, but kind of the mid 60s percent range. And our antibodies suppressed IgG in the high 70s every now and then you have a study that's a little bit lower, a little bit higher.\n\n00:16:31,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, And so this was a study that we ran on our first generation NTF-serine antibodies called betoclomab, which It was developed by Han Oil, a South Korean company. And. is a really interesting drug. Except it has one not so small issue. Which is that, in addition to interrupting IgG binding to FCRN, interrupts albumin binding to fcrn and so it reduces blood albumin levels. And on my fifth day as CEO of Roivant, we found out that one unexpected consequence of that is it significantly elevates LDL. So we got to work on a phase three program anyway, which is the study that just read out this week. But we also got to work developing a next-generation drug called IMVT-1402, which is designed to have all the same properties as botoclumab, except for that interference of albumin. And actually, I think it was on Biotech Hangout we talked about a year and a half ago. By the fact that we had achieved those goals, and B42 does the same things as botoclumab except for the albumin. Now, that said, we were still running this study in myasthenia gravis with betocumab, and that study ran out this week.\n\n00:17:31,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n End. There are a lot of interesting directions we could take this conversation. But we were very happy with the data from the study in that it showed two things that we really cared about. One is that it showed a quite a deep dose response. That is the lower dose of botoclumab, which is similar to F-cortisumab in its IgG suppression. Uh produced clinical data that looked, at the face of it, pretty similar to the data shown by F-Cortegemod 4. 6. Six point reduction in MGADL from baseline.\n\n00:18:01,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then the high dose. Uh, 680 milligrams of tokamab showed a 5 . 6 point Restaurant reviews 4 . 7 on the low-dose. 5 . 6 point reduction in MJDL, which is. The largest. Absolute reduction in MGADL. ever shown in a big late-stage study.\n\n00:18:19,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n So a very impressive number. Now, the other like. contentious, interesting talking point around this data. is our placebo response rate was a 3 . 6 point improvement in MGADL.\n\n00:18:32,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n And when F. Cartesian Mod had run their studies, they showed like I think a 1 . 7 point improvement in MgDL in placebo, so a much lower placebo response rate. And as a consequence, our placebo-adjusted deltas were smaller than theirs. Even though the absolute magnitude of benefit or high dose was larger. I think that's a complicated setup, to be honest, because I think. One of the. One of the earliest lessons you learn in biotech is you can't look at drug effects alone. You have to look at placebo as well. And in this case, they point in pretty different directions. Terms of the quality of the drug and so that's been a sort of interesting controversy. I'll pause there and see. I can go a couple different directions with this.

Okay, I wouldn't necessarily Eric— did you have a question?\n\n00:19:22,830 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, but no loud and clear. Keep going.\n\n00:19:25,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. Sorry. So— What?\n\n00:19:33,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oops, can you hear me?\n\n00:19:34,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n Oh yeah, that's better.\n\n00:19:35,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sorry. The question is, okay, so what do we do from here, basically?\n\n00:19:39,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n So one of the questions we wanted to answer. was does deeper IgG suppression improve clinical benefit? We've shown this in a number of other studies, including in Graves' disease and some other places that we're really excited about. No one had ever really shown it to this level in Mycenae Gravis. So that felt good to us, and it sets us up, we think, well, for IMVT 1402 and Myasthenia gravis. But we faced all along this sort of nagging decision about. What to do with botoclumab. This is a registrational study. We could file with FDA and we think get approved on it.\n\n00:20:07,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n But it's got this fact that it drives up LDL cholesterol and lowers albumin. And even though it produces an impressive absolute clinical benefit. It is both hampered by its placebo-adjusted Delta and more importantly hampered by. this lab abnormality that it creates. And so, we had decided and said publicly. A long time ago that it was unlikely we were going to launch Patokamab. Because, as Sam started with, F Cartesian Mod VivGuard is such a great approved product. It was going to be hard to compete. And so. We are focusing on the next generation drug. I'm 54202. which is now going to be in.\n\n00:20:39,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n Six studies imminently.\n\n00:20:42,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n most of which pivotal or registrational. uh in the announced indications or mgcidp Graves and difficult to treat fourth line R. A. and then two others that we're going to announce in the future. And our view is. Look, in indications like MG and CITP, where Argenix is clearly ahead of us, we're going to fight based on the properties of our drug to take share. And we've also put out some CIDP data this week that looks fantastic. It's earlier and a little bit more complicated data, so it's hard to know for sure. But if that pans out, I think we have a huge commercial opportunity in CIDP. NMG! Look, we're going to fight for it, but we're coming from behind. And I think it'll be tough to unseat the king, as it were. But in every other indication, we can be first in class or close to first in class. We'll be running our studies at the same time as they are, so we won't be hampered by differences in time. We can talk more about why those people were different, but I think a big piece of it is. They ran their studies before patients knew that FCRNs worked. And we ran our studies after patients knew that FCRNs worked. And so there was a lot of expectation bias embedded in the placebo response rate, which we won't have in these other indications. And I think that opens us up to be a class leader in every indication but two.\n\n00:21:48,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n In MG &C IDP, we may be behind. But the biology of FCRN is very broad. There's literally probably two dozen indications or more. They're currently being studied. And I think in all but those two, we should be expected, in my opinion, to produce competitive or better than competitive data. and a really attractive profile. So you asked originally about the question of commercial competition. I think that's really the reason why we're focusing on 1402.\n\n00:22:15,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Matt, since you didn't get the push back on your data that you were hoping to, no one was willing to engage with you and debate the results. Maybe, maybe just a question for me is, you know, I don't cover your stock, but You know, one thing we always hear from investors is just how crowded the IGG lowering space is, whether it's the graders or agents like your own, you know, it seems like they're a dime a dozen these days. Can you address that?\n\n00:22:41,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I guess I.","char_start":19880,"char_end":24259,"start_time":"00:19:18","end_time":null}

Uh, Argenix obviously paved the way and showed what you can do commercially in my scene and grab it. Is one of these great orphan indications with a lot of unmet need where Where I think. The market size has so far meaningfully surpassed. Sort of antecedent expectations.\n\n00:23:04,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n It's attracted a lot of attention and therefore. Whatever, imitation is the finest sport of flattery. And in biotech, the scariest form of competition. A lot of people are trying to do the thing now.\n\n00:23:16,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Look, I think actually two things that I think are interesting about that comment. Which I've tried to get away from.\n\n00:23:23,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n One is the FCRN space literally.\n\n00:23:27,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n is not that crowded. There are maybe four real late-stage FCRNs. R's, UCB's, J &J's, and Argenix's. And.\n\n00:23:38,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n J &J and UCB have good programs, but like slightly more complicated profiles in different ways. Organics is the leader, and I believe we should be. Sort of number two or number one, depending on where and when.\n\n00:23:50,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n But. Unlike, say, CD19 bispecific T cell engagers. Where. It feels like there are 150 of these in development, mostly unlicensed by either big pharma or smaller companies from China. You just saw yesterday, I think. Santa Fe announced a CD20. by specific deal.\n\n00:24:07,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Unlike that area, which is related, right, similar biology, the Fcrn category itself doesn't have as many imitators. There's, like, viridian and a couple of others, kind of coming, but not that many. And I think part of that's because bluntly, Fcrn is a difficult target. You have to avoid albumin, you have to think about pH and other things. And so. It's just been harder to create these antibodies.\n\n00:24:28,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n So that's sort of narrowly within the class.\n\n00:24:30,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n On B-cell depletion, IgG, sort of immune reset, auto-anybody work generally?\n\n00:24:36,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n My view is: It's pretty myopic. To call it crowded.\n\n00:24:41,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n When you compare it with RA or UC or even like HX. Where it feels like there's 15 different mechanisms in development in HS. On the inflammatory side, inflammatory disease is a much more advanced commercial landscape. We've been working on anti-inflammatory mechanisms since, I mean, since forever, but certainly since Humira. And so I think the IGG, B-cell landscape is much newer. But I think it's a really big tent and people forget that sometimes. And so they focus on what does it mean to slice up the pie of MG or the MG plus CIDP pie, which look big, but maybe not as big as it could. Overall, as it could.\n\n00:25:16,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n But they forget that. There's 330,000 prevalent Graves patients who have failed.\n\n00:25:21,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n All available therapeutic options, other than surgical removal of their thyroid, there are tens and tens of thousands of patients. With my ascites. There are tens and tens and thousands of patients with, there's a bunch of cardiac indications that are not even yet being pursued. There's pemphigus and BP, which Argenix has done some work on. There's so much biology under the tent. But yeah, there will be multiple mechanisms approved. But we are in Humira's second year of launch. In the analogy to or maybe an embryo's second year of launch in the analogy to inflammatory disease. And I guess what I think is the size of the market and the number of available indications. So far, expanding much faster. Than the number of competitive classes.\n\n00:26:07,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's great, Matt. Thanks very much for a very good, passionate detail, I would say. No less than every other time.

So that's great and an interesting update. No.\n\n00:26:20,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n In the interest of time, I think we do have some other data points we need to move on to. I want to pass it on to Eric to talk about the INSEAD data. Over Sydney and the share price was That headline was positive and the share price was telling you something else. So I'm interested in your take on that. And then we'll move on to pretty much talking about exon skippers and siRNA and etc. related to DMD to start with Eric?\n\n00:26:47,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks, Matt. I mean, this is the POVOCITINIB data that you're referencing. It's a JAK1 inhibitor for hydrodinitis superativa. That's HS, as Matt Klein was just speaking to. Dermatology indication that is very large, we think this is probably a $10 billion market, it's still Um, The. Quite young in terms of its market penetration. We only got the first couple of drugs approved for Hydrodinitis superativa four or five years ago and and Those were the TNF inhibitors. More recently, we've had some IL-17s that were approved. And now we're heading into brand new classes of agents, and there are many in development coming behind what we're sitting in, many of which feature different mechanisms. But the POVO data kind of designed to be maybe a third-line therapy here after TNFs and IL-17s. As you mentioned, Sam, the data were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were great, but there were two different trials. Two different arms of bufacitinib in each study, and there was a consistently higher drug effect over placebo in all cases.\n\n00:27:54,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n With stats significance. So I think it's very, very, very likely that Oversitneb is going to be approved, and yet, as Sam mentioned, the stock was down. Why was that? Well, the data were just so-so on BOVO. They weren't particularly strong. And I think there are a lot of questions now with the competition, and in particular with another Jack. inhibitor coming at these RENVOC, which we'll read out in the first part of next year, whether there isn't a fairly wide open opportunity for RENVOC. To do about as well as Povo insight had been suggesting that Povo could be high dose to a higher level of Jack one inhibition and that might result in a higher level of efficacy and The POBO data kind of line up with the IL-17s, but they're not particularly stronger, maybe on the margins somewhat weaker than UCB's Bimzela. So what we're left with is AbbVie having the next shot on goal. And if AbbVie is going to be successful with RENVOQ, that drug already has a brand name.\n\n00:28:54,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of course, it would have AbbVie's resources behind it. I think investors are just kind of scratching their head right now and trying to figure out if, in this third line setting, which, you know, may be worth a billion dollars or two billion dollars in peak revenue potential. whether it's going to be uh inside scheme or or whether RENVOQ won't come in and steal their thunder here. Meanwhile, this is a company that's got a lot of question marks around it. And Pobo had been thought of as potentially the most interesting drug in their pipeline. As we head toward the eventual patent loss exclusivity on Jackify, their $3 billion blockbuster. So with the POBO news behind it, maybe again, as Matt was referencing, it's kind of open season for the shorts and people have come back to this name and don't see now the pipeline as being capable of maybe providing growth through that patent cliff.\n\n00:29:51,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, it's um, it, I guess there is also the thing, as you said already, thinking that Abby has proven its metal in this, in the general space, with Humira and then Renvoke and Skyrizi in the general overall space, that that, that, it just might have the advantage of being Advil, right?\n\n00:30:16,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n And now Eric, you're, I think, we can move on to DMD now, um, you wanted to just touch on the RNA Dyne dataset, and then we'd move on to Brian to talk through the general comments from the Muscular Dystrophy Association conference.","char_start":27814,"char_end":32141,"start_time":"00:26:07","end_time":null}

I guess I get the glass half full view and get to talk about a new set of agents that are really starting to I guess, provide a different benchmark for what exon skippers are capable of doing. I'm specifically talking about the avidities drug Delzota, which is being developed for a subset of DMD patients who have exon 44 minimal mutations.\n\n00:31:10,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n And Dein's drug, DYN-251, which would be appropriate for patients with exon 51. Uh, mutations in total, you know, there's probably no more than two to three thousand patients who might be amenable to these two exon skippers. We're probably talking less than 20%, maybe 10 to 15% of the total DMD marketplace. But these drugs seemingly are doing what hasn't been possible before, which is the ability— they're showing the ability to create quite a bit of exon skipping and, in some cases, creating full-length dystrophin up in the 10 to even as high as 25% range. Just to put that into context, you know, the first generation exon skippers were— we're potentially producing full-length dystrophin closer to one two three percent. So we've got a sea change going on here. I think the sea change is best—uh— evidenced by the fact that in the avidity studies, you are seeing CK levels, CK being a marker of muscle decline and dysfunction, you're seeing CK levels go down to essentially normal levels in these patients.\n\n00:32:18,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n This is something we have never, ever seen. Seen before. In fact, there's been a lot of debate in the DMD community around CK as a biomarker and whether it's even a good biomarker of muscle damage. Because nobody has been able to hit it very hard, and certainly nobody has been able to hit it consistently in all patients like the ability data are showing. This dramatic reduction toward near normalization of CK levels, that is something that I am very excited about. I'm curious, of course, to hear Brian's views on this. But to me, for the first time, I'm very optimistic. That if you're truly reducing these markers of muscle damage, you're going to truly benefit patients in terms of functional outcomes. We haven't yet seen that from dying and invidity. But those data are coming. Ability will show us a meaningful functional update toward the end of the year. And I'm optimistic that's going to be better than anything else we've seen. Meanwhile, both of these companies are are marching toward uh bla approval of bla filings.\n\n00:33:21,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think avidity is expected to file at the back half of this year and then uh dine uh some point in the early half of next year. But let me turn it over to Brian for his thoughts. I know he's very, very close to the space.\n\n00:33:35,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, um, it's interesting. Right, we've seen, sort of, first-generation PMOs where the initial drugs approved, uh, on very low expression, controversial approvals. And, you know, the game here has really been to try to get more and more disproven expression. I think, if you talk to any parents of any of these kids, you know, they'll say, that's just a very meaningful thing to them to see more expression. It's believed to be better, I think, given the biology of disease. That is sort of a pretty obvious statement to make. Um, ideally, you want to normalize it, but there's a lot of data historically showing that if you're above 10%. Uh, dystrophin. Um, compared to a normal person, you're really phenotypically much different than a DMD patient and more like a Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype. So I think that, like, 10% threshold is something that's very meaningful. And even if you go back to the controversial approval of Teplerson, even the FDA reviewers who were against the approval of a Teplerson, they sort of leaned on this 10% to say, well, if it was above 10%, there's just much more precedent to say that this is a meaningful threshold versus the 1% that you","char_start":31841,"char_end":36264,"start_time":"00:30:16","end_time":null}

So I think it's great. We're getting more muscle-targeted distribution.\n\n00:34:55,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n We're getting drugs that hang out a little longer than PMO, which very quickly gets peed out of the system.\n\n00:35:05,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n We see this move back and forth between sort of the chronic, um, exon skipping-based therapy, which you know has to be taken in small subgroups at a time. You know, um, Exxon 51 amenable patients only make up 13% of DMD, and that's the largest subgroup. Uh, you know, you get into increasingly small subgroups. So these drugs need to be designed again and again, again, to go into increasingly small patient populations, particularly given the controversy around some of the gene therapy. You know, it's nice to see continued evolution here. Obviously, Sarepta has been very successful in commercializing exon therapies. Exon 51 and there are two other exon skipping therapies. Um, you know, one of the questions we still have is: we've never seen randomized clinical studies uh succeed really for any of these disease-modifying therapies here and I think that's a big question mark and you know, a bit of a headwind to this entire group of dystrophin replacement. Therapies and, you know, kind of use that to segue into, you know, MDA is usually a very good conference in terms of a lot of new clinical presentations, scientific presentations that I think provide a lot of hope and a lot of optimism and encouragement to patients and caregivers with this disease.\n\n00:36:21,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it's really unfortunate to have the event somewhat marred by this event that came to light.\n\n00:36:29,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n This week, some news broke of a Dear Doctor letter that Sarepta issued following the unfortunate death of a patient treated with their gene therapy, Alevitis. The proximal cause being liver failure. So this drug was approved under controversial circumstances. On this specific case, I would like to use this to kind of re-engage in conversation about how to think about regulatory approvals. But in this case, the use of high-dose systemic AV-based gene therapy has seen liver toxicity across serotypes and diseases. And we know there have been deaths in other programs, even commercially, like Zolchansma, which on label has deaths due to hepatic failure. So it really does seem that controlling for liver inflammation and liver damage is one of the most consistent safety issues for this systemic gene therapy space. Each company has different protocols in place to try and minimize immune-mediated reactions that can cause liver toxicity, all of them prophylactically using high doses of corticosteroids prior to treatment and sort of tapering down a month or two after treatment.\n\n00:37:35,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n A number of them may use other immunosuppressants as well. I know eculizumab is either used prophylactically or on hand. In many cases. But clearly, it isn't enough.\n\n00:37:48,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n At least in the protocol that they're using here in this case to completely mitigate liver failure.

And I think this is really the case— not so much because a liberal-related death is so completely unexpected, but it's now. You know, really cements of something real where the efficacy of this gene therapy is controversial. So it raises the question of the risk-benefit balance here. So to just recall for everyone, it failed a randomized, placebo-controlled phase two study that was meant to be used for initial approval, but wound up still being used to obtain accelerated approval following an adcom. Where the review division was critical of the application, but the advisory committee members voted in favor of approval. A Phase III study then also failed to achieve the primary endpoint, but an application for full approval was accepted, and a levitas was granted full approval in ambulatory patients and accelerated approval in non-ambulatory patients. And when that approval came out, FDA issued some internal documents as well, reflecting that the head of CBER, Peter Marks, essentially made the decision over the objections of a good portion of the review team.\n\n00:39:16,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I think that the aftermath of this patient death and, you know, what I've heard in client conversations over this week is it really raises the question that I think has to be consistently litigated in the space and that is: how do you effectively balance risks and benefits for regulatory approvals? And there's sort of this dichotomy among the population where you know people really want access to potentially beneficial therapeutics faster— i mean, that's why we have things like right to try. That's why, you know, we have a lot of advocacy groups pushing for for faster development, cutting through red tape quicker. But we also don't want drugs that that wind up having a net harm. You know, in this is just the type of situation where, in the aftermath of this, people Struggle with okay, what is did the FDA doing? The right thing, does the FDA now have to act to do something to reverse course? Um, was it still the right because it's one in 800 patients where there's a liver-related death? But if this drug is really beneficial, then certainly for DMD, that may be an acceptable safety.\n\n00:40:21,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n For patients and their caregivers.\n\n00:40:26,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, you know, I think that's really the big question that gets brought up once again here when we have a controversial approval, a safety event. A deaf, unfortunately. Um, you know how, how do we really view the FDA's role and, and providing gatekeeper, and, you know, what's. Too much of an unacceptable risk, what's too too much too little acceptable data for approval and and you know this is something that I think I've been discussing for over a decade and in my research and it's just an area that you know is just always under constant evolution and relitigation.\n\n00:41:02,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thanks very much for that, Brian. Really, really good as usual. Matt, Eric, did you want to add anything? Obviously, a very sad situation here. And I have to say, Brian, I agree with you. You in the general commentary about this is, if you had been through a normal regulatory process, which I would say this has not, then it would have been a different conversation. But did you guys want to add anything before we move on to the last bit of data?","char_start":39215,"char_end":43074,"start_time":"00:37:48","end_time":null}

But did you guys want to add anything before we move on to the last bit of data?\n\n00:41:31,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I just maybe have a question for Brian. It's one that we've been struggling with a lot here, which is whether micro dystrophin is really something that matters to patients. So we've seen Good microdistributive expression, as you noted, Brian, with both the Sarepta and Pfizer gene therapies. Neither has really amounted to much functionally. The Pfizer drug missed all of its endpoints, despite. extremely good micro dystrophin expression. And yet, now, with these exon skippers that produce more of a full-length molecule, we're starting to see, I think, something very different biologically. So, to me, at least, you know, I think the FDA may have gotten it completely wrong in approving drugs based solely on that. ability to uh to provide for micro-distant expression, but curious of your thoughts.\n\n00:42:19,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think, I guess I would say, I don't know, pretty much across the board. And, you know, we were talking about sort of the PMOs and the next-generation Exxon skippers.\n\n00:42:29,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Again, it's never really been truly determined in randomized placebo-controlled studies. Right now, we don't know what level of dystrophin, whether it be, you know, the just the exon skip dystrophin, which is, you know, like 98% of full-length dystrophin, versus um these engineered micro-dystrophins, and you know, maybe some of them have better efficacy than others, and maybe there's a different threshold— maybe 80%— of like where dystrophin would be equivalent to 10% of exon skip dystrophin. Um, I think you know, we're sort of all operating in Plato's cage to some extent, like we're looking at shadows and and we're just not quite sure, you know, what. I have really criticized all of these companies on again and again and again and again, and I totally understand the counter. Argument it goes back to what I'm saying, like you know, the patients, caregivers, physicians, they really want things quickly. Um, this is a disease that is horrifically progressive, but it is not that quickly progressive, right? It's sort of similar in my mind.\n\n00:43:30,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n To like Alzheimer's to a certain extent, it's more progressive than Alzheimer's, but a one-year study there is so much heterogeneity in how a patient is going to look, right? Because You know, you have the simultaneous counterbalancing of patients are growing, patients' muscle function is growing along with them, but you also have this damaging disease. And, you know, if you look at patient-level data, and I mean, I remember kind of freaking out about this, going into the Teplitz and Drithenperson approvals 10 years ago, or reviews 10 years ago, PTC had this great slide of their study where they had all the patient-level data, and you would see patients who were like, improving, you know, 100% on the six-minute walk, you'd see other patients going down 100% on the six-minute walk. And these are placebo patients, right? So I think the problem, to me, is that I just honestly don't even think a one-year study is really going to prove it out. Because if you have a patient who you know trips and sprains their ankle, um, all of these measures are going to look terrible for that patient, and that doesn't mean that the drug isn't working.\n\n00:44:35,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n But if they're on the drug arm, that's going to really kill Six Minute Walk, NSA, Time to Rise. And if one of the placebo patients happens to go through a growth spurt, all of these measures are going to improve for them. So I think it's really, you need a lot more patience and a longer follow-up. I do think we'll get a lot more data when Sarepta's study of their exon 45 and exon 53. Um drugs read out that's studies sort of taken forever, but I think next year we'll finally see a two-year study in about 200 patients and I think that will be really informative. Um, but you know, I think to me, we just don't really know outside of what's decent bio plausibility from preclinical models that any of these things could work. We just really don't know that it does work as hypothesized in clinical studies yet.","char_start":42774,"char_end":47209,"start_time":"00:41:31","end_time":null}

So really appreciate that. I'm just going to mention the last bit of data, which, of course, is quite interesting because it's from Alnylam. And if you remember last year.\n\n00:45:47,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n Some folks I don't know if anybody in here thought the same— the anonym ATTR data was going to be the thing that was going to save, was it last year or the year before? I can't remember. It's all merging into one.\n\n00:46:02,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n biotech sector that was going to be the key driver, the data came, lots of people had questions, etc. So of course, that drug is now approved, and VUTRA is in the second setting, which is the uh, the cardiomyopathy indication.\n\n00:46:17,640 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, it's a subcutaneously dosed, quarterly, which is a pretty good setup for here, for the drug. It's a silencer, which may have an advantage over, um, and Eric's gonna comment too. Uh, the the um, the drugs Acromedas and the families, but that's, which are stabilizers.\n\n00:46:38,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the label they got was pretty nice and broad. And I think that is why the stock is reacting, I would say.\n\n00:46:48,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n It covers across the board in terms of the possible indications that you could get for this. So and the thought process is that this is a, at least, from consensus data that we have in the terminal, possibly a $5 billion product by 2030 or more or less. But I'd love to hear from Eric also, with regards to, I know that Eric's colleague has been a fan of BridgeBio and Acromedis.\n\n00:47:18,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n Josh, who is one of our friends and regular presenters here. So Eric, did you want to touch on this? Anything to add? SharePrice is telling us a good story, but then.\n\n00:47:30,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, Josh, maybe he may be your friend, Sam, but he's just my colleague.\n\n00:47:36,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I think maybe the most surprising thing today is that Alnylam is up 10%. I mean, this is a drug that, as you previewed last year, we got the phase three data. They were very strong. The stock went up. Nobody expected the drug would not get approved. There was a little bit of debate around the margin on Whether they would get the full label language they really needed, which was about some kind of survival benefit on the label. Both Acoramidus and Tifamidus from Pfizer, from BridgeBio and Pfizer, respectively, do have such labels. They needed to hold serve and get something similar. They did. And the label is generally very good. But honestly, I think what we're seeing today, and what we've really been seeing over the last couple of weeks in biotech, is a flight to safety. Any larger, stable, earnings-driven organization, which Allen Island certainly is, has seen an influx of funding and, conversely, unfortunately, almost any smit cap slightly higher risk, non-earnings-driven name has seen an exodus of funding.\n\n00:48:42,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n My guess is that that's the dynamic here that's happening today. This ATTR marketplace is an interesting one. First of all, it's enormous, it's rapidly growing, and certainly there's room for many, many players. And you're right, my colleague and friend Josh Schumer has been a big fan of Akramidis and the launch they're having with BridgeBio's support. That drug was approved late last year and had a very good initial month and a half or so of sales data in 2024.","char_start":46909,"char_end":50668,"start_time":"00:45:34","end_time":null}

Expectations still on Wall Street for Futisaran, mostly because it's a different mechanism, are very, very high relative to. The forecasted sales of Acker Amidus, and we think it'll probably be a little bit more of an unequal game between these two for market share, which, which relative expectations would seemingly benefit the bridge bio side of the equation. But Al-Nilam's got a great drug. Nobody should be raining on their parade today. Again, I think number one first and foremost: this is a very large market that is growing at a very, very rapid pace. And I don't think there are any losers of the space.\n\n00:49:57,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n The only thing I would add is you are all very brave for having a conversation about all nylon and bridge bio on Twitter. Because you will definitely get. 8 million comments from people with extremely strong opinions. On the back of this.\n\n00:50:08,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n But Matt, I've only got two followers, so it doesn't matter.\n\n00:50:11,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Send my comments over to Josh, please.\n\n00:50:15,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's right.\n\n00:50:17,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now let's move on to deals. We've had an interesting flow, a couple that I'm going to highlight. And then Eric, I know you have.\n\n00:50:26,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n A thought on this as well, of course. The one's the Sanofi dren bio, and the other one is AstraZeneca's acquisition of a Belgian company. Um, so I'll start very quickly with that. It's a biotech, it's a company that Astra has acquired, paying 425 million dollars upon deal close. Then there's 575 million um in development regulatory milestones.\n\n00:50:51,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's an in vivo cell therapy company, so lentiviral. In vivo, if you want to call it a car t, so they are. There are new others that are playing here. The hope of all of these companies is to um, cut quite a lot of the burdensome aspects of CAR T therapy out of the equation. Number one, the fact that you need to go through lymphodepletion. Number two, the fact that you have to take the CAR-Ts, then manufacture them, however long it takes, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, depending on who says what about their product these days. And then, of course, you have to give it back with a large amount of CRS, et cetera, that you have to manage. Here, you've got something that you could truly use as an off-the-shelf product.\n\n00:51:37,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n What is remarkable here, and I have tried to find out, this is a company that was in stealth mode, and I think this is something that Eric wants to touch on. What's remarkable here is that from what I have found, this company has raised something in the region of $25 million so far. So selling with a $425 million upfront cash, that's pretty good return. And when you then look at, I don't know how long it was in stealth mode, et cetera, but it doesn't really matter. It's still a pretty good return for that amount of money being invested. And it's not that different from the story of Dren Bio, where they've sold an asset, from what I understand. Um, for uh, 600 million upfront to Sanofi, with a 1. 3 billion dollars still to come in development and milestones. Uh, launch milestones, and the company still carries on operating independently. So, Bye. This is a T cell engager, not a T cell engager, sorry. Myeloid cell engager. That aims to deplete B cells heavily.","char_start":50368,"char_end":54224,"start_time":"00:49:11","end_time":null}

That aims to deplete B cells heavily.\n\n00:52:42,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n So the first one is more about a platform that Astra has acquired. Um, adding it to its cell therapy platform that it recently acquired, also through Gray Cell. Two different approaches, and here we have something that's a By specific, that tries to get very deep resale depletion. I would say not necessarily the same return here because the company, from what I gathered, has raised something in the region of $180 odd million so far, but still $600 million up front, and it still carries on. So now I know, Eric, you've been thinking about these valuations and what it means for-biotech in generally. Did you want to just touch on that?\n\n00:53:25,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no, thanks for that great intro. And I'm curious to get Matt's view on this too. I know that Roivant spends a lot of time acquiring assets and thinking about valuations. What struck me about these two deals is the price tag, as you noted, Sam. Uh, the price tag is not inconsiderable 425 million upfront in the case of So Biotech and $300 million upfront for the asset in the case of Trend Bio. These are enormous valuations in the private sector relative to what these two companies would be trading at in the public sector, right? So they're both phase one. They're both unproven assets.\n\n00:54:05,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n There's a good chance that neither of these companies would have a positive enterprise value right now, as bad as things are in Smidcat Biotech. The money that's pharma is willing to shell out for. Private assets is a strong disconnect to what's happening in public valuations. Maybe these deals are being negotiated for the last three or four months. Maybe Pharma felt they couldn't renege on terms that have been partially agreed upon or something. But there's something very wrong, because if you were Sanofi or if you were Astra, you could have gone out and bought something similar. Not exact. I mean, the in vivo CAR-Ts are for the most part private. There's still a few. Other companies that are also trading privately that probably would have liked this valuation.\n\n00:54:52,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n But you could buy a lot of things in the public markets for. really pennies on the dollar relative to what we're seeing here. So, Matt, I don't know if you have any views on this.\n\n00:55:03,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, look, I have a pretty.\n\n00:55:05,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that's an interesting point of view. I have a pretty different take. on a theme that I've been watching.\n\n00:55:11,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n the last 18 months. Which is to me like, Look, I'm not a public markets biotech investor to me, like one of the biggest, most important questions for the public markets biotech universe.\n\n00:55:22,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n this year and into the future is. What we've seen an enormous amount of is big pharma companies doing deals like this, right? Four to $800 million asset deals, either an earlier stage or out of China or out of smaller companies. Instead of whatever, buying.","char_start":53924,"char_end":57216,"start_time":"00:52:42","end_time":null}

What we've seen an enormous amount of is big pharma companies doing deals like this, right? Four to $800 million asset deals, either an earlier stage or out of China or out of smaller companies. Instead of whatever, buying.\n\n00:55:38,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n If you like T cell engagers or B cell depleting therapies, buying. You know, there's a couple of public companies calling in whatever. That have later stage programs. That would have cost a multiple of what Santa Fe paid in this situation, for example, with premiums and everything. And I think the sort of value buying, as it were. Would you think of it as a premium to small public deals or as a premium to what you might be able to do in other private situations? It's a huge discount. To paying $6 billion for a development stage public company. And I think how that balance shakes out and what kinds of deals these guys are doing is going to be interesting. It will clearly have a weird compressing function. If it turns out that pharma companies are now looking to buy earlier stage assets for hundreds of millions of dollars instead of late stage assets for billions of dollars. It's going to make the late stage assets less valuable. And the early stage assets more valuable. And that's just been like something that we've been watching as an acquirer. We've been watching as we. Look in all different places for things, including the portfolios of big pharma themselves. So it's an interesting thing to watch overall.\n\n00:56:39,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I guess I was coming at it from maybe a slightly different angle than you were.\n\n00:56:45,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thanks for that, Matt.\n\n00:56:48,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't know, other side of this. These are, as Eric, you said, that at least in VivoCart, most of the companies are private. So if you wanted to play there, it's easier to go and negotiate a price with some of these companies than try and negotiate it. A share price or a price for a public company. But they're also pretty edge-type investments. I mean, they are, you know, myeloid.\n\n00:57:18,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n Redirecting by a specific engager for deep B-cell depletion, etc. I would say that maybe the fact is that they're trying to get to and bits of science or product development that are right at the front. So then, you know, if it's Astra.\n\n00:57:36,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, they've done their party play with Greysel. What else are they going to do in that space apart from going into this?\n\n00:57:43,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n At this stage. And now they're one of the leading companies in because everybody is in the same kind of stage of development in in vivo CAR T therapy. So I don't know. Does that even hold water? I just thought I'd throw that in.\n\n00:57:58,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, we're very close to the last minute here. One of the things I wanted to highlight is something that I noticed just today, which is AstraZeneca's investment in China. Which is a, I think they announced a two and a half billion dollar investment in a research center in Beijing, research manufacturing, AI. I mean, that's a big number. And I have to say, there was vaccines in there too. And they were supposed to be investing something like a 400, let's say $600 million.\n\n00:58:25,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n investment in the UK vaccines, which of course didn't happen because there was some disagreement with the UK government. What's interesting here is that it's Astra who's just had some issues with regards to a probe and the details are not out there yet. There was an investigation with regards to the um current and former employees, etc. And everyone thought that, you know, Astro is going to cool down and they've doubled down. So that's that's interesting, especially in the current time where we're seeing a um maybe companies trying to be closer to the US than they're showing. Listen. Uh, with China, so that I thought that was quite interesting and clearly, Astra is thinking about what is good for its prospects as opposed to today's political environment.\n\n00:59:12,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, right. A couple of minutes or a minute left. Anyone want to make any last comments?\n\n00:59:19,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm looking for the uh unmute buttons to go off. It doesn't sound like it.

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to Biotech Hangout. dot com. Um. So let's start, you know. We know, after each month, right, we get kind of an overview of how the markets are doing. Everybody looks at kind of performance of the hedge funds and kind of the XBI. Et cetera. February was not a great month for specialty investors, and we're approaching the end of March.\n\n00:00:39,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n So let's just talk about kind of the state of the markets right now. Tim, why don't you kick us off?\n\n00:00:47,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. So while we're speaking at the moment, the XB I'm looking at my screen is at 84. 45. So it's actually down 4% this week. uh, For whatever reason, biotech just has not been performing well. This year. And I think if you talk to people about like what's going on, you'd hear two things. The first is that there's just been tremendous uncertainty about the Trump administration and what their intentions are. What it all means for the economy and for the biotech ecosystem. Specifically.\n\n00:01:21,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n The second thing going on, I think, it's pretty clear that there are certain funds that are struggling to keep their LPs in line. And yesterday I spoke to two different fund managers who both cited rumors, but no specific information. That certain funds are sort of for selling mode. It sure feels that way, right? So like the actual fundamentals right now are not that bad. In fact, I would say they're pretty positive. And yet, E. the desire of people at the margin to buy by tech has not been good. And I think, you know, there's nothing different about the market today than a year ago or five years ago, fundamentally. Like we still have lots of great innovation. We have lots of good management teams. So it's easy to point to zombie companies, companies that waste money. There's all sorts of reasons to not want to invest in the sector, but there's also a lot of good reasons to invest in the sector. Those haven't changed. So it's really the more the macro, I would say, external factors that are coming for where we are.\n\n00:02:27,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n moment. We're going to touch on both the public markets and the private markets. And I want to go to Bruce in a minute, but do you think the Hedge funds track outflows right. This is this much a function of you know. You've got LPs who invest in a lot of different sectors. And they've just been looking at the last four years and. Kind of sluggish, you know, or non-returns, even if a specific hedge fund might be overperforming, right, the XBI or other, you know, sector indices, they are looking at this versus other sectors. And so. It's the outflows, really, even if within our circle.\n\n00:03:05,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n You might have a hedge fund that's overperforming. Is that one of the phenomenons that's going on?\n\n00:03:11,680 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. So there's a couple of things that I've heard. The first is that, you know. The endowments, the university funds.\n\n00:03:21,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, the you know, large sovereign funds that are behind so many. Of the hedge funds in our industry are in general not that optimistic about.\n\n00:03:34,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n The perspective returns.

And, you know, I was worried, like, are you just spreading rumors or you say something that's true? This was the guy. Who told me Armistice was in trouble, you know, six weeks before it showed up in the Wall Street Journal. So he was right. That doesn't mean he's right this time, but what he was saying this morning is that there's a couple of funds that have been really strong performers over the last couple of years. So, you know, some of these hedge funds, you know, while everyone else is kind of hovering around the average, like, are just, you know, doing really well. And there's a couple of funds that have significantly underperformed this year. They essentially went long the market and ended up being wrong. And so those guys are getting hit with requests from their LPs to take money out. And so as those guys are liquidating. And it sure felt like this week people were liquidating. As those guys are liquidating, you know, there's just not enough buyers in the market to absorb that flow.\n\n00:04:35,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. So, Bruce, I'd like to go to you first. I want to do a shout out. You did a nice interview on the state of the markets with Brad Longcar for Biotech TV. You were on a panel at MassBio. Year um, you know, from the venture side and you've got you know quite a portfolio across kind of the spectrum of maturity of clinical stage you know uh, pre-clinical, how are you viewing the the current market dynamics in any um, you know, any perspectives on where we go over the next six months?\n\n00:05:02,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no thanks. For uh, um, you know, thanks for asking me that. So, let me make a couple comments on Tim's remarks, which I which I fully agree with, and then I'll comment a little on the venture side. I just looked at the last five-year returns in the XBI, even 10 years, and it's amazing. The S&P has outperformed by like 10,000 basis points. It is just remarkable. And most of that is because, you know, as we peaked in February of 21 and dropped, you know, the S&P has been on a tear the last couple of years.\n\n00:05:33,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n If you're a mutual fund or you're being benchmarked to the S&P or to you know any particular non-biotech sector, whatever biotech allocation you have, has been to drag on your returns. And so you're seeing a lot of folks shifting their allocations to make sure. For the prior 10 years, if you weren't equal market biotech or overweighted biotech, you generally underperformed your index. I think that has a lot to do with where we are. Chris, you mentioned zombies and people pointing at zombies and saying how horrible IPO performance has been. makes me think about 15 or 20 years ago, in fact, I think it was the New York Times, it might have been the Wall Street Journal, that coined the phrase 'zombie biotechs' when they were talking about these IPOs from 1991, which in 2010 were essentially trading at or below their IPO prices, but were still around. And this idea that in the public market, market some of these zombies can live forever this is not new. The IPO class of 2005-6-7 they were almost universally trading below their IPO prices within a few short months of their IPOs and certainly by the end of the decade, the vast vast majority of them were under their IPO prices.","char_start":3330,"char_end":6976,"start_time":"00:03:34","end_time":null}

And I think Tim is exactly right. There are a lot of great teams. There are a lot of great innovative assets out there today. And so there are reasons to be optimistic, but it does feel pretty bad right before the darkest hour of the night, right? So it doesn't feel great out in the marketplace today. On the venture side, I would say. You know, the um and we primarily focus on the very earliest stages of venture creation, and we're going to start the same number of companies that we've started the last handful of years. Um, but it is interesting to look at some of the numbers, and I had a chance to peek at, you know, what the first quarter looks like in terms of new first financings of biotech companies, so a good proxy for sort of startup venture creation.\n\n00:07:36,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, back in 18 and 19, there were roughly 100 brand new companies getting financed for the first time each quarter that spiked to about 180 at the peak of the bubble in 2021. For that first quarter, it's at 50 right now. Um, a little bit above 50 maybe when all the data comes in, lend at 70 or something like that. But this is a far cry— you know— a 60, 65, 70 reduction from where we were in 21 and well below where we were if you consider 17, 18, 19 as some sort of pre-pandemic norm. And so there has been a huge contraction in the number of new companies getting formed.\n\n00:08:17,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would highlight that when those contractions happen is actually a great time to start companies. I mentioned in the biotech TV interview, you know, Nimbus was started in the bottom of the market in, you know, spring of 2009. Chimera was started when the markets were a mess in 2015 and 2016. You know, this is a great time to start new, innovative companies if you can build them with discipline and capital efficiency.\n\n00:08:44,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, Bruce. So help me, you know, you've been attributed to Booth's Law, which was, you know, really held true when the when the bullish markets came. It wasn't necessarily that there were a lot more companies established, but you would be seeing more money going in. To those first financings or to those companies that are started. Now, we're at a point where we have probably more venture biotech dry powder than we've ever had. Help us square the circle. Like we already know, the phenomenon of more money going to proven management teams. But when you see a contraction in the new companies that are created— not necessarily, but across the sector— yet you have all of this money that ultimately has to be deployed. I mean, where's that money going, or where's it gonna go? Are we gonna see more of the Series B, Series C, Series Es with that money? I mean, just help us understand that.\n\n00:09:41,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, look, I think it's a great question. Right now, I think there are a lot of folks sitting on their hands. I mean, if you do look at quarterly outflows from venture firms into biotechs, it's running at about $5 billion. And it's still at $5 billion. It peaked during the bubble, but $5 billion is way more than we were 10 years ago. And so it's clear that there are a handful of companies raising lots and lots of money and that that is part of what we're driving. I think. I commented on it at the end of last year. The skew between the median and the average is the largest I've ever seen. It. Having looked at that measure of sort of the distribution towards the haves relative to the have-nots is massive. So we're definitely seeing that. I do think the series BCD folks, you're seeing a lot of capitulation finally on press. And you're going to see, you know, series B's repricing A's and D's repricing you know these companies because it's been a a challenging place to raise money and B you have a constraint and a bottleneck around getting public.\n\n00:10:46,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so this huge backlog of companies that would much rather be raising public equity are stuck raising private rounds.","char_start":6676,"char_end":11063,"start_time":"00:06:45","end_time":null}

And the kind of wall-crossed pipes. And then, Stat did an article that was kind of a retrospective. Of a year ago, the pipes were in the news because you would see confidential information shared with kind of insider biotech. To do a pipe and then a week or two or three weeks later, right, the data comes out. They're locked up, of course. Um, uh, and you know, they get a deal. But now, the retrospective on the performance is middling. Right. It outperforms the XBI, maybe more, performs the small mid-cap, uh, you know, a bucket of, but but it's not been a kind of a—you know—a boon, right, to uh, the investment strategies for these funds. So any thoughts about the pipe phenomenon?\n\n00:11:58,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I there was a take that I think also Daphne posted this. There was a sub-stack that she said it was a dark take on the industry, but one of the key themes there was that, because of this insider-ish phenomenon of pipes, it's moving the generalist further away, because they're looking at it as, hey, this is just an insider's game. I don't want to touch it. I don't like how we're seeing these deals come together. As one reason that people are not comfortable coming back into the sector. But any thoughts on this, Pipe, if you were able to read the stat article or see some of the chatter?\n\n00:12:37,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n Chris, it's a great question. I did see Daphne's post. I didn't read that article. And I'll give a point of view in a moment. But I did want to make a comment on Bruce's remarks. Which are, I had posted some data in our weekly last week from Dealforma. And so, Bruce, indeed, the number of just venture rounds— that are happening this year on an annualized basis— is down quite significantly. Versus two or three years ago, and it's certainly down from last year as well. And then the average amount raised per venture round this year is $65 million. Last year that was 56 million, the year before that it was 46 million. So you're seeing a dramatic increase in concentration of investment.\n\n00:13:19,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, and I looked at that and I said, you know, I bet you that's just like Bain and Arch. So I took those guys out of there. And it wasn't. The whole industry is essentially concentrating their bets into fewer and fewer companies.\n\n00:13:35,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n And, you know, on the pipe question, I saw Daphne's post. I mean, I thought it was really interesting. I had never run those kind of data myself.\n\n00:13:43,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n What? She showed was that most of the money that the funds are making are between the moment that they receive confidential information, and then the moment at which that confidential information is released to the public. And obviously, that can't make anyone feel good right because it does feel like you know let's call it legal insider trading right you're getting you're getting a peek at data you get to essentially be induced to buy a stock at a price that's a little bit too low and then what her data showed.\n\n00:14:14,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n was that there was very little money that was made after that. And so most of the alpha from doing these pipes. comes from the information that you gain and it kind of that sort of feels right um it's it's not great And just to repeat, I think, you know, sometime in the last six to nine months, we had this debate on biotech hangout. And. The pro for doing these pipes is it's a necessary evil. It's a way that companies can get money in. And right now, getting money in is really important. If you're a CEO of a biotech company, ideally you'd have at least three years of cash. So many do not have that. We're in this down market where things are really tough. So, you know, the price of poker is you've got to show some leg well. Then you got to show some leg, and so it's—I'm not the one to say that what's going on is is wrong or irrational.","char_start":10763,"char_end":15192,"start_time":"00:10:46","end_time":null}

And well, that did a good job of just highlighting an example of where the pipe works. and one where it didn't work, and what was interesting to me is that, when you look at the mean, there was a a positive right— you know, gain. You know, for all those pipe investments. Um, but if you looked at the median, it was negative. So, like, two-thirds of the pipes didn't work out. Now this has been a tough tape, and somebody I can't remember, but this was also posted, I think, on Biotech Hangout, where they looked at. From $5 million to $2 billion, you know, so Smidcap. Biotechs that were publicly traded and looked at enterprise value and stock return. And it was really depressing, and it was over the last year. So we're not talking about the last four years, just the last year, which, for me, emphasized that we are still in a challenged environment. And so, again, I agree with Bruce that there's a lot of reason for optimism. I've been wrong multiple times in predicting that post-election uncertainty leave.\n\n00:16:11,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, you know, we'll have to kind of see how I think interest rates have a big part of it. And I think administration changes. So let's pivot to that. We had, you know, approvals for McCary, for FDA, Bhattacharya, for HHS. Uh, announced cut. Uh, you know, one of the first points of order a lot of turnover and change in the administrative ranks, that's somewhat not too surprising. It's kind of like when you get a new CEO. Uh, you know, that's orchestrating a kind of a new vision for a company. Uh, we don't usually follow— you know, VPs and directors and you know, SVPs are switched out for you know, new management, but that's what's happening. And clearly, as we've talked about, I think Brad Loncar coined this: we have the establishment crew is being replaced by the anti-establishment crew. And that's, you know, definitely in full force. You know, a lot of debate on whether this can work or if it's gonna do more damage. Uh, than good. Um, you know, with all these departures and discontinuity, the one thing I'll say is FDA.\n\n00:17:16,079 [SPEAKER_0]\n It seems that they have protected the division reviewers and are focusing on the cuts that I think we're about.\n\n00:17:24,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n 25% to 30% to a third of the HHS cuts. So about 2500 or so. cuts to the FDA, but they're apparently saying that's not going to touch the reviewers. So it should, you know, they're signaling that it's not going to disrupt PDUFA, but that's a debate. So anyway, Tim, let me go to you. Any thoughts about what's been happening every week? There's kind of new. Uh, change in turnover here. Uh, what are your your your latest thing?\n\n00:17:50,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, let's just talk about the facts. So, 10,000 cuts from HHS. There's also 10,000 voluntary retirements at HHS. So, according to what's been put out there, there were 82,000 people. So that implies 62,000 people at HHS. And then they've actually been pretty open in the Trump administration about where they're hitting. So they're going hard after. FDA, CDC, and NIH. So more than two-thirds of the cuts are coming out of those three organizations, which are far from the majority of the area. In the FDA, so just to give you some statistics which I looked up. And 2000.\n\n00:18:36,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n 19. The FDA had 19,000 employees. At the beginning of 2024 the FDA had 19,700 employees.\n\n00:18:46,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n With the voluntary reductions, and they haven't told us how many of those voluntary reductions came out of FDA. I know so many people that have left FDA. Let's suppose that it was 3,000 and an extra 3,500. So that means the FDA is going from 19,700 people to 12,200 people. That's a huge reduction.\n\n00:19:08,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then if you say you're protecting your reviewers, where's the rest of that going to come? Well, the FDA inspects all of the plants around the world that make drugs, the FDA inspects food supplies. The FDA is involved in tobacco regulation. I mean, it's not like there's like this one division of people twiddling their thumbs.","char_start":14892,"char_end":19373,"start_time":"00:15:05","end_time":null}

I mean, it's not like there's like this one division of people twiddling their thumbs.\n\n00:19:29,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, so somewhere along the way, there's going to be a significant change in the number of personnel. How that maps into the actual effectiveness of FDA, I have no insight, but it doesn't sound good from where I sit.\n\n00:19:45,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yep. Well, and again, I just read a little bit about. The areas that they are cutting but it doesn't address the voluntary right uh departures so he could be absolutely right but it was more on the policy administration communications like HR uh that kind of all I would call back office and less on the front lines but again I these people have important jobs so it's not to suggest that Those are easy cuts, but yeah, we'll be definitely interesting. Bruce, I want to just come back to you. How do you, as a venture investor, view this? Have you gotten any insights recently?\n\n00:20:21,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, that you're willing to share about um just is FDA in working order from your portfolio companies um I'll just share we've had a little bit of a conservative stance and we're trying to figure out if that's division related, if it's because of newer reviewers. Who are being overly cautious, right, if this is a real trend or not. But just any thoughts on the venture side as it relates to FDA?\n\n00:20:45,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, look I'd say, on a practical level, of the 50 or so portfolio companies we have, you know, everybody interacts with the FDA to some degree. You know, over the last four or five months, you know, since the election, we haven't seen any material change in the FDA's ability to interact with us and provide feedback and you know work collaboratively. That said, that was before the news of the couple days ago where a huge number of people are going to leave. So that does, and they said they were going to protect reviewers, which is of course, great for companies that are engaged with reviewers. But I'm with Tim. That's a huge percent reduction in what the FDA's mandate is supposed to be. So it's hard to imagine that it won't have real consequences on timelines, quality of engagement, the type of interactions we need to be able to bring innovative medicines forward. It's definitely concerning. I haven't had enough time in the last 48 hours to really process the magnitude of those changes and what it means.\n\n00:21:46,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n And Bruce, just to jump in, we are sitting here at a moment when the first time the U. S. is facing real competition in drug discovery and development from China. I can assure you that the Chinese FDA isn't reducing their staff by a third right now, right? I mean, this is the time.\n\n00:22:08,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n In China, where they're investing in their their pharmaceutical infrastructure, and you know, my gut instinct is— if anything— we want to make it easier for the FDA to do its job. Not more difficult.\n\n00:22:23,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n Tim, I agree with that. What is interesting, you know, the FDA, as a gold standard regulatory organization, holds a pretty high bar. When I think about generating that early human data. Most of our companies, the vast majority, do not start their clinical work in the United States. We start work in Australia. We start work in Europe. We start work in the UK. Because those regulatory agencies are more collaborative, very early on, and enable us to get to clinical data faster. China today. Their FDA is working aggressively to allow Chinese companies to get the patients really fast and generate those early data packages that are. So, accretive from a value creation perspective, reducing their cost of capital, allowing them to do partnerships with pharma companies or allowing them to spin out assets into venture backed companies. But the FDA is generally. A much harder regulatory organization.\n\n00:23:24,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't know if this is going to be the case with the new administration and where that bar goes, but I think it is instructive to think about the comparative regulatory posture towards early clinical testing. The FDA has been the toughest group in the world for that, for sure.","char_start":19073,"char_end":23472,"start_time":"00:19:29","end_time":null}

If we try to move through pre-IND, right, with FDA to do a SADMAT in the US, we're almost in parallel, always ready to pivot. Because as soon as you run into a conservative stance or they don't let you dose escalate, even if you're not on clinical hold, it really. Can be a challenge and so yeah, I think there's definitely room for improvement. Uh and you know, that maybe the wishful thinking is is that you know they realize that we need to be more competitive and McCary says, 'We need to make it easier to do early safety studies and get into patients sooner in the U. S.' Really great comments. Let's move on to some of the other topics at hand. Sam. You are covering European Lung Cancer Conference. A lot of updates across industry. You want to start with that?\n\n00:24:30,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, yes, I do. But do you mind if I just make a very quick comment on this whole conversation you guys had?\n\n00:24:38,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n I've brought up on my Bloomberg screen the five years, as Bruce highlighted, S&P, Nasdaq Biotech and XBI. And in the past.\n\n00:24:53,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's say month and a bit. Both the S&P and the Nasdaq Biotech are down. Nasdaq biotech down about 14%. Sorry, not biotech, Nasdaq 100.\n\n00:25:03,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n and S &P down about 8%. And our sector, of course, the XBI has kind of dwindled down. There wasn't one big drop. So here's the question I think a lot of people would ask themselves is, having seen the performance of the XBI over the past, or the sector, let's say, over the past five years, If I have money today, where would I put it? Would I go to buy the bottom? Or, the next low point that I'm happy with when it comes to the Nasdaq listed stocks, or the SAP listed 500 listed type of stocks, or do I want to put it in biotech? I think, if we just keep it as simple as that, add it to what you guys just said about a generalist sitting there looking at all these pipe deals, thinking, 'Well, I get a clear signal here that I shouldn't be playing because this is obviously something that needs wall crossing to understand.'\n\n00:25:52,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that's part of the issue. It's so much easier just to go into another cash flow, a low point of a cash flow generating company, than try and figure out what biotech to buy. Um and I don't—I don't know what the how you come out of this dark night. How long is this dark night? I've no idea. It's very hard. I think every time we've tried to do it, we've burnt our fingers. So I just thought I'd add that. It's not exactly a positive comment.\n\n00:26:19,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n But an important comment. But Sam, why don't we go to the cancer conference?\n\n00:26:23,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so um, we have two things that I want to touch on. One is the um the battle that's going on between Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca as you all know. AstraZeneca has one of the leading drugs in the treatment of EGFR, but the leading drug in the treatment of EGFR-positive lung cancer, and that's called Tegrizo, which I think, when it succeeded, I've heard some companies had some EGFR inhibitors in development and decided no point carrying on. We can't possibly beat this. And if we do, it will be just by a margin. So Tegviso is the standard of care for treating non-small cell lung cancer, which is driven by EGFR mutations. And so, of course, some others have wanted to play here. And I think Johnson & Johnson is now trying to set a claim that it is the new standard of care.","char_start":23172,"char_end":27063,"start_time":"3:24","end_time":null}

And I think Johnson & Johnson is now trying to set a claim that it is the new standard of care.\n\n00:27:14,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n And this is not the first time. We've had data earlier on. It was World Congress of Lung Cancer about a year, year and a half ago. And it's quite important because we're just sitting there with this being one of the biggest— biggest drugs. And of course, that makes it super important to the continuity of the company to generate the cash it needs for the significant R &D investments that it's making. So J &J is coming at it from a different perspective. They say, 'Okay, well, we have a combination drug, which is ribavant, a cement targeting antibody. You could call it bispecific if you want.\n\n00:27:50,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Something that is similar to griso, a TKI that inhibits EGFR. And so, of course, you've got the issue that you've got an extra mechanism of action. And that clearly does give you some benefit. It gives you a benefit on progression-free survival. It gives you about a year extra on overall survival.\n\n00:28:09,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n The question is, why isn't this going to be the standard of care going forward? And of course, it's side effects.' Side effects is one of the main issues. And some of those side effect issues can be dealt with by switching to subcutaneous ribavant from IV, which of course is very helpful because the drug you're competing with is just a daily oral drug in tech resources.\n\n00:28:33,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n And what they need to do is to, so the subcutaneous switch is going to address some of the side effect profiles. The one that's troublesome is the skin disorders that it causes. And that's something that I think the company has to continue to to work on and I heard from my colleagues there that a special session on this was specifically focused on that um and which of course suggests that even they see it as a major issue to deal with. And of course, the other angle is that AstraZeneca is in sitting still. They've got data for Tegresa plus chemo, which of course then takes you into chemo, IV. But that also is likely, in our view, to probably match the survival benefits of the ribavant or the data that J &J is providing. And there's another element thereafter, and that's a combination strategy that they're going into, which is a C-met, an oral C-met inhibitor that they've got.\n\n00:29:34,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Partnered from China's Hutchmed, which has been in development for a while, and that's showing very very decent, very exciting, deep waterfall plots in terms of response rates, etc. So that's why we think anyone who writes an article saying, 'Yep, here we go, Johnson & Johnson's claiming the crown,' I think we need to see how physicians actually do this. That was one that was mostly reported, and of course, the other one is Biontech. It was a relatively highly anticipated.\n\n00:30:11,889 [SPEAKER_2]\n Update from them, two posters, one, both of them in small cell lung cancer, not non-small, small cell lung cancer. And it is for one of these VEGF bispecifics. So it's their VEGF bispecific, which is BNT327. It's a PDL1 VEGF, unlike SUMMIT and AKISOS, which is a PD1 VEGF. So there are some differences there, and you could argue. One better than the other clinical data will show in second line. Uh, I think there were some uh folks who didn't really like the what we would— i would say a a decline in the um overall response rate that we saw from what people had expected, which was around the 60% before to down to 42%. So I think, given what I've heard from a few clients, that's something that unnerved folks.","char_start":26763,"char_end":30577,"start_time":"00:27:14","end_time":null}

So I think, given what I've heard from a few clients, that's something that unnerved folks.\n\n00:31:08,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n But we believe that in second line, the change that happened between that first readout of around 60% to this now readout of 42% is the fact that they started recruiting more. Pretreated patients. So, if you're treatment naive, you're more likely to give a better response than compared to an IO naive, sorry. Than one that has had IO before. So that's what we believe has been the driver of this drop in overall response rates. Nevertheless, the second line data that we've seen in terms of median OS, median PFS, ORR, and DCR still looks pretty decent to us. And then, of course, there was the update on Firstline. And in Firstline, Again, I just saw an Endpoints article calling it a potential win and it does look good compared to the current products that are on the market— either the ones that contain an immune immune checkpoint inhibitor or the ones in delta, which is from Amgen.\n\n00:32:16,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n But there's one thing that I don't like, and that is the spider plot that we've seen in the poster.\n\n00:32:23,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n There are lots of patients who are progressing quite quickly— early on, two months, four months after the uh, after the start of therapy. So, but the spider plot looks really nice to start with. It's just that you don't like seeing all those things that arrows or lines that start jumping back up again. And other than that, it's really good data and really promising. And I believe that it supports them going into a phase three, which I think they're They're either in or about to go in for first-line small cell lung cancer. And of course, opportunity here for combinations. I think the company is thinking about B7H3. at their own TROP2 inhibitor, bispecific, or ADC, sorry. And so there's quite a lot of opportunity here to do better.\n\n00:33:08,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Two datasets that I thought were worth looking at at ELCC.\n\n00:33:11,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n Look, very important. With one of the big four cancers, lung is one of those that is a little more elusive to generate good datasets. You know, many drugs have failed in lung where they've actually succeeded in other cancers. And so, an important meeting to really differentiate who are the winners and losers. How are these new drugs being positioned?\n\n00:33:29,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n Now, Sam, I'm going to come to you in a minute on the obesity space because there was a big deal with China. Based biotech, but before we do that, Tim, I know we started the hour with saying you're working on a China report and I think you visited there recently. Would love to before we go into that deal with a China-based biotech—uh— give us your perspective on yeah, there's been a lot talked about over recent months and the last year about you know where's China in our ecosystem and how is it influencing what's happening in the U.S. investment. What are some of the early insights that you're seeing?\n\n00:34:03,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, so just a couple things that are a little bit new on China. The first is, I mean, this is, I think, pretty clear from the news. There's a lot of China cross-border deals this year. And so.\n\n00:34:16,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Chris from Dealforma sent me the latest data this week. So he and I sort of reported in January that 31% of all large pharma molecules.\n\n00:34:30,489 [SPEAKER_3]\n last year. were from China, and that wasn't a surprise to me, but it did appear to be a surprise to a lot of folks in our industry because that stat caused a lot of buzz.\n\n00:34:42,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n This year, the number is 41%. And if you look at the dollars, in other words, upfront dollars, it's even higher. So China is becoming ever more important. I spent a week in China, not last week, but the week before that. And it was an eye-opening experience. I had just been there. In November of 2024, so it's only a four-month difference, and you could it was as if the country had changed a lot in just four months and maybe to highlight.","char_start":30277,"char_end":34542,"start_time":"00:31:08","end_time":null}

In ADCs and by specifics. But we all sort of said to ourselves, well you know you don't have to worry— they're not going to get into, you know, the new stuff like whatever Bruce Booth starting a company around right now is probably not facing a lot of Chinese competition. Chris, probably the same is true for you. So I was very struck by just some of the conversations about the new codes that are being formed by Chinese VCs. So, for example, one of the hottest areas right now in the U. S. would be IgG extracellular degraders, so-called ASPGR degraders. So I met with one Chinese investor and company. And the guy was making several valid points about weaknesses of those ASPGR degraders. And he said, 'So we've been thinking about this really hard, and this is what we're going to do. And so he spelled out a strategy.' To essentially overcome the weaknesses of those strategies, all of a sudden, this is like an emerging technology area where a Chinese company is going to be out in front.\n\n00:36:24,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would say that I had in one week five or six conversations like that. So, for example, another kind of like holy grail topic in our industry is getting rid of HIV. So a functional cure for HIV is something we've all been looking for for a long time.\n\n00:36:42,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think a number of people have been sort of saying for a while that you know, maybe CAR T is the way to go. So I just met this Chinese scientist and he says, well, you know, everyone's been saying CAR T is the way to go, but. Let me tell you why it's not going to work. And so he went through all the technical problems with CAR-T. Achieving a functional cure for HIV. And the problem is that these cells that have the virus become quiescent are very hard to hunt down.\n\n00:37:06,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n And so he described it in vivo approach.\n\n00:37:09,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n To do it using in vivo cell therapy and started to show me data that he's doing it. And I was just like, 'Wow, I mean that is just so awesome and and uh, it's it's coming out of Hangzhou, China. I visited Hangzhou. It was so exciting. You know, this is the city that came up with DeepSeek and you know, the number of brand new tall buildings that had been put up for new ventures.' It looked just like Kendall Square, to be candid. And maybe better.\n\n00:37:44,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I just met entrepreneur after entrepreneur who was energized and they were talking first in class innovation on this trip, not, you know. Hey, I'm going to be a lot better at doing, you know, Joe Blows by specific. So it was a very interesting trip, yeah.\n\n00:37:59,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, you know, it's it's it's a little bit of the when you have competition. Like that, you know, whether, you know, in the U. S. we joke a lot about the Bay Area and Boston, Cambridge, you know, or, you know, the, the, the second player, the Avis versus the Hertz, is always like chomping at the bit to do a better job. It feels like that's happening on a global scale with China. And Bruce said it earlier with regulatory agencies, right? There's a lot of ways that they can move levers to gain competition. Bruce, let me quickly ask you: has it changed how you think about company creation, knowing there's a lot of available drugs? In China, that might be better characterized— might be able to be licensed.\n\n00:38:42,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n Versus working with a U.","char_start":34242,"char_end":38054,"start_time":"00:35:16","end_time":null}

And so whether you're starting companies out of those assets, we've done a few of those, or you're in licensing some of them into existing portfolio companies, it's going to be important. I would say innovation has lots of forms and innovation around molecule origination is one piece. But then how do you think about developing it? How do you think? About the translational medicine approaches, the early development approaches. There's lots to innovate around where I think the talent pool in the US is particularly well equipped for being able to do so. I see it as more of an opportunity. I do think for companies that are working on new things today, the whole um The whole way you disclose what you're working on will change.\n\n00:39:51,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Where companies will keep a lot more as confidential trade secrets. There'll be less early filing. Typically, biotechs try to file patents early as a way to say, 'Hey, I haven't issued patents, you know that'll help me raise money. I think there's going to be a lot more behind the scenes, confidential, undisclosed, and you're going to wait until the last moment where you might be back in the clinic and dosing before you disclose the targets you're working on and the things you're doing. So I do think in general that lack of transparency around what folks are doing is a bad thing in the global sense, but it's going to be an important way for companies to protect themselves from super fast followers showing up in China quite quickly.\n\n00:40:36,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no one's going to bet against a China fast follower strategy, so you want to go as far as you can. Well said. Sam, let's come back to you. So obesity still in the news, dealmaking, two deals that we'd love for you to cover.\n\n00:40:52,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, sure, Chris. Of course, one of them is with the China biotechs. But if you permit, one of the things that China has suffered from in the AI race. um deep seek aside is their lack of access to um to the nvidia type chips and of course you for that if if you wanted to make them yourself you need an access to the sort of uh machines that asml produces the the double-decker bus-sized lithography equipment and there aren't Pretty much nobody else can make those because of the The detail that you need to think about when it comes to the lithography is part of it.\n\n00:41:34,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Here they have no barrier. The barrier here is how many people do you have and how much money do you throw at it and how good are your scientists? So I think as I've thought for the past 10, 15 years, have been going on about China and having gone to China, I think they're doing an amazing job. And I'm pretty sure that the output of research from there and publications and funding is just going to continue to get pretty close to what the US does, especially if the US starts entrenching a little bit. On that front, Novo Nordisk did two deals this week, which is interesting because they're both in obesity, which is their, you would have thought they've got everything they possibly need in obesity. But one thing that they've got is the deal they did with United Laboratories for UBT 251, which has just completed phase one for ex-China rights, basically.","char_start":37754,"char_end":41768,"start_time":"00:38:42","end_time":null}

But one thing that they've got is the deal they did with United Laboratories for UBT 251, which has just completed phase one for ex-China rights, basically.\n\n00:42:32,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n What this deal involved was a $200 million upfront and up to $2 billion in terms of total contingencies, et cetera, or milestones. And it's a triagonist. It's a, from what I understand, it's in one molecule, GLP-1, GIP, glucagon. So it's similar to Eli Lilly's Retro True Tide. Now, Nova had something like this, but we don't really know the detail of exactly what the three elements are. It might be. GLP-1, GIP, amylin, or whatever. Or it might be three, I don't know exactly whether they've ever disclosed whether it's three molecules, separate three molecules, or one molecule in terms of one large peptide of 40, 50 amino acids or 55 amino acids. So the deal is—um, you know, the company's got data, and the data is 16. 6% weight loss at 12 weeks, which is pretty much in line with what we've seen from—competitors.\n\n00:43:38,956 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's an injectable, of course, so um it does it does look like it just gives a new, quicker access to to this triple agonist world if they want to go down this road. Now, Lilly is in phase three with her at True Tide, which we should start seeing data for. is starting late 2025. So they're a little bit behind, but honestly, this is such a fast-moving, it's almost as fast-moving as AI in the obesity world. So in terms of the snakes and leathers that we're going to see here now, one thing I just want to keep reminding everyone: Lily's CEO, Dave Ricks, I loved the phrase he used once. He said, 'Look, if you have the same mechanisms, you're going to get the same efficacy. There's no magic here, I think the phrase he used. And I don't think there is any magic here. You might be working on the margins in terms of 16% or 17% or 15%. But they're all going to work.' So the question is, how are you going to manufacture them, get them to patients, and cut yourself a market share, which of course for Novo is not an issue, given they're one of the biggest players.\n\n00:44:48,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, on the point of drugs in development, we've done a quick assessment. There are more than 100 drug makers that are after obesity with 160 drugs in development. This is compared to 120.\n\n00:45:02,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n In the last time we looked at the analysis, which was in August last year. And over 40% of them are in phase two, and a whole bunch of them come from China.\n\n00:45:13,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Of course, when you look at the deals that were done in China, that includes Merck with Hanso, AstraZeneca with IncoGene, Novo United Labs, and of course, the Chilera, which I think we call.\n\n00:45:28,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, a uh, what do they call them? It's not just a spin-out; a new coat, um, there you go. And the deal today that Noble Notice did is with actually a company that I hadn't forgotten about, but I've given up on, and that's Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. Lexicon was in the game, or not the game, the running for SGLT2 drugs, which of course there are two significant ones on the market, one from Lilly and one from AstraZeneca. And they're oral drugs. They're for diabetes. They do give you some weight loss, mostly. Because of the reduced availability of calories in your bloodstream, because it promotes the secretion of glucose through your kidneys. And that does have some side effects that it brings with it. Their drug eventually got licensed to Sanofi, and Sanofi eventually gave it back and gave them $260 million. And so I'd forgotten about them. And then today, of course, this deal comes—$75 million from Novo Nordisk as an upfront for a preclinical asset.\n\n00:46:29,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think it's an Acetyl CoA.\n\n00:46:32,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, uh, is that right? Here we go. It is a mechanism of action, is a ACSL5R inhibitor. So I have to really think about this because I haven't come across this mechanism before. We're digging into it a little bit more to get our head around what the opportunity is here, but it's got an effect on the feeling of fullness and also an impact on an impact on energy expenditure, et cetera. So it's not exactly a— it's a completely novel mechanism, which is interesting in the portfolio, but $75 million for a preclinical asset sounds pretty punchy to me.","char_start":41468,"char_end":45950,"start_time":"00:42:32","end_time":null}

Absolutely. Thanks for that, Sam. And actually, related to the obesity field, a subset of the obesity is a genetic rare disease called Prader-Willi. For the audience, it's not familiar. And we just saw the first drug approved. Uh by seleno, uh, the drug's called Vicodin XR. It's actually an old drug, but a sustained-release form of an old generic drug. The data was pretty compelling. But, you know, this is a stock company that was trading at, you know, four to five bucks a share about 18 months ago, and today is trading over $70 a share. I think, you know, a lot of the kind of conventional wisdom was that they would get approved, but the stock still popped. This past week on the approval. Uh, it's, uh, they've communicated the pricing. It looks like for its weight-based dosing. And it looks like they're going to be about a half a million dollars for the average weight of a patient with Prader-Willi. And their projected peak sales is about $2 billion.\n\n00:48:20,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n So very interesting development for this company. Just shows you that there's There's companies that fly under the radar and that aren't getting the attention. And when they produce a data set that can get FDA approval, it can catalyze a company very quickly. To billions of dollars of value. Pretty Willie is one of these where you mentioned appetite and suppressing the feeling of hunger. Well, this hyperphagia. is the the main characteristic of this, where they never feel full, so they're constantly eating, and they have a score. The hyperphagia questionnaire used in clinical trials and they showed a pretty extensive reduction going from about you know nine plus points on the scale to less than three points on the scale. And a placebo-adjusted difference of five points, uh, which is in their label, and so they're you know they're approved and uh, that was a big uh, you know, for those of us who've been in the rare disease, I know, uh, Bruce, you've done a lot in the rare disease space, many have attempted, did, many\n\n00:49:24,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n knew that this was an important population. It was nice to see the first approval. And also sticking with rare disease, Wave announced additional data with their ex-53 drug and their plans for submitting to the FDA. The data, the most compelling piece of the data, was they have a time to rise improvement. of more than three seconds, which is significant. This is called the Gower maneuver where they started a sitting position on the floor. and they time how quickly they can get up. They also had a lot of biomarkers. that suggests creatine kinase and fibrosis reduction on these biomarkers. They also hinted that they have other clinical data. that's pointing in the right direction, including North Star and other measures. So they did say that the FDA is open or welcoming their submission. And then, like a lot of DMD companies, they're comparing to Sarepta's and other approved drugs for dystrophin as a biomarker to show that they're producing more dystrophin and that they have some clinical outcomes to support that.\n\n00:50:33,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n Again, I know this well. It's a small study.\n\n00:50:39,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n Patients treated. It was an open-label and they compared to historical controls. So again, it'll be interesting to see in this new FDA, do they go to advisory panel? Are they still open to these types of approvals on small data sets? Where is that sentiment around DMD? I'll just also add that Exxon skipping, this is the same. mechanism and technology that the first three drugs for Sarepta were approved on. And with the recent death with Sarepta's gene therapy, it still looks like exon skipping has a place in the armamentarium for DMD. So those were updates there.\n\n00:51:20,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bruce, any comments on that? I know you guys look at a lot of rare disease and have invested in both of these spaces, if I recall.\n\n00:51:28,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no, that is true.

So it's nice to see some some successes in that space for a community that's never had real medicines made for it. So it's awesome.\n\n00:51:56,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Absolutely. All right, Sam, there was some CG oncology data that was released this week. You want to cover that?\n\n00:52:03,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, yet another conference also in Europe, European Association of Urology, CG Oncology's is in the world of treating bladder cancer. They have a drug that I'm going to call Crito. I'm not going to try and pronounce it here because every time I try, it doesn't work out.\n\n00:52:20,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n And it's a They basically engineered what they call engineered conditionally replicating oncolytic immunotherapy]. It's delivered into the bladder. Similar to what what folks do with BCG and not that different to what's done with the current, where the current excitement is— which is Johnson & Johnson Tar 200, otherwise known as the pretzel, which is a tiny little, um, relatively tiny loop. That's drug eluting. So that gets delivered into the bladder and releases chemo. And it's shown really, really good data. And these guys are chasing the same. Kind of um, patient population non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, because you obviously You don't want to go beyond the bladder into systemic, because you can't deliver this systemically. 70% of new bladder cases are NMIBC.\n\n00:53:17,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n So what the data showed is that in their phase three trial, 112 patients they had a pretty decent uh response, complete responses um didn't quite get up to the numbers that we've seen with Tar 200.\n\n00:53:34,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Definitely on the CR rates at 12 months. And CR is what people are after here because that's what you can get with these localists' therapies. But there are differences in the background of the patients in terms of carcinoma in situ or papillary, etc. So that complicates the comparison. But to us, the data looked pretty decent and their side effect profile looks a little bit better. So it really does position them in what I believe to be a competitive, at least from a data perspective. What would be nice is to see the further data from other cohorts of this trial. It's called BOND003. Um, And we look forward to seeing some of that. And it's also a good comparison for Protara Therapeutics Advance 2 trial, which will be. looking at as they report. The problem for all of these folks is who wants to go up against Johnson & Johnson? So they'd need meaningful partnerships, et cetera, or to be bought out in the end for them to be able to compete.\n\n00:54:39,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll leave it there.\n\n00:54:40,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n00:54:42,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n Tim, I'm going to come back to you.

And so my reports just go on forever and ever and ever. And he kind of gets to the point.\n\n00:55:15,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I put out a very lengthy report on aging. And just to give you like the two or three minute summary.\n\n00:55:22,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n So you know, what we call pharmaceuticals began in 1620 through the work of Paracelsus. Paracelsus's main goal was to essentially achieve human immortality. If you look at what was called pharmaceuticals before that, which is really like things like herbal medicines, various forms of witchcraft, whatever. The main goal was to help humans achieve immortality. What we found is we've just kind of reviewed the history of work on aging. It is the— really has been— the principal objective of most thinkers about health and medicine for many millennia.\n\n00:56:07,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n What's so fascinating is that Today. There are hundreds of thousands of research papers on aging science.\n\n00:56:16,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n And yet, if you look at the Biotech industry, I would never, Chris, call you or Bruce conventional, but let's just call you guys mainstream investors. There are actually very few mainstream investments made in the field of aging. And that's because I think there's a widespread view that the science is not translationally ready. And so. The current report that I put out, um, was meant to just sort of show where the literature is now and if you read the report, it takes a while to read it because it is it is reasonably lengthy. What emerges is a sense of three therapeutic strategies.\n\n00:56:53,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n That appear to have substantial validity. One of those strategies is to remove senescent cells. So senescent cells are cells that stop replicating. It turns out that they do lots of bad things. Another strategy is to reprogram cells to a younger phenotype, and that sounds like total science fiction until you read all the papers and you see it's possible. and a third strategy that's also very interesting is to actually replace cells and so we've long had things like organ transplants and so it's also possible to do cell transplants and there's there's some work coming out of one lab at Stanford that would suggest that that's also very viable strategy.\n\n00:57:35,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n And so it was just very interesting to kind of trace the history of this field and why write this long report on aging. And the main point I'm trying to make is that this field is going to be translationally ready, and it will make everything else we work on in our field look small, right? It'll make even obesity look like a very small indication.\n\n00:57:58,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I'm going to be putting out another report shortly that will sort of walk through how it all needs to play out for it to work. And I'm not telling anyone, you know, like, 'Hey, I've got this pill you can take, make you live to 200, you know, tomorrow.' But the science is moving very fast in a very decisive and interesting way.\n\n00:58:18,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, look, I think Bruce would agree. The science usually precedes the ability to translate and develop drugs. And so sometimes we will be 100% agreement on the science of a field, but don't feel that it's ready to figure out the clinical regulatory pathway on a given technology. So, you know, even if you don't see a lot of investment in area, many venture investors will not dismiss an emerging field like that. We're close to the hour. So let me just wrap by saying, hey, we're still seeing some. wind downs lindra was a high profile you know bob langer you know delivery technology that got a lot of investing and they announced their kind of wind down they couldn't raise money for their schizophrenia pivotal trial. It seems we have other brand names like Encarta, Elevate that announced double-digit layoffs. So we're still seeing the signs of challenges and just a kind of a postscript on the 23andMe which kind of the writing was on the wall but they've officially declared bankruptcy, couldn't find the buyer or the investor to come in.","char_start":53377,"char_end":57503,"start_time":"00:55:15","end_time":null}

When you were the CEO, now you come back and buy it— how is that going to change the story? And then, just the last thing on that, the co-founder of 23andMe, Linda Avey, posted on both LinkedIn and X.

So it's worth a read to to hear about a very high-profile brand uh that that wasn't able to make it— but uh, look. Thank you all for tuning in to this episode of Biotech Hangout.

I'm Eric Schmidt and my co-host today are Brad Loncar.\n\n00:00:13,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yaron Werber, Paul Matisse, and Nina Selchon, who I think is able to join. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episodes, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:26,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n So fellows, a long week already. I'm exhausted.\n\n00:00:31,330 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's been a tough week too, right? The macros certainly are flying against us on a number of different fronts, whether it's the FDA, vaccines.\n\n00:00:41,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n Just the overall. Biotech community and the markets. And I know this is a troublesome topic, not a lot of fun either to discuss, but I feel like we are going to have to spend a lot of time. As some of these institutions, in particular the FDA, are just very different, it seems, than they were even a week ago when we were last gathering. So we'll get there. Brad, I hope maybe you can first.\n\n00:01:06,330 [SPEAKER_4]\n Start us off on potentially what's the least of our concerns in biotech, which is another macro head— the tariffs that are being discussed.\n\n00:01:16,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n At least affecting the broader marketplace, maybe to a lesser extent, biopharma. What are you hearing and what are you seeing there?\n\n00:01:24,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, I saw like a press gaggle that President Trump had on Air Force One last night and there's like a YouTube clip of it if anyone wants to watch it. But basically, a reporter asked him directly what's going on with pharmaceuticals. And he said, they're like, quote unquote, working on it also with semiconductors. So it's clear that we're not part of like, at least on the U. S. side, the broader tariff plan that was implemented yesterday. But it's also pretty clear that there's going to be tariffs on pharmaceuticals. It's just a matter of. When and how much, and you know, I think the big issue here is. Our industry has built so much, especially manufacturing capacity in places like Ireland, where there's both low taxes and low wages.\n\n00:02:25,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n Remember we had the whole like re-domiciling controversy about a decade ago. There are still a handful of really important companies that are domiciled there.\n\n00:02:38,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think that ultimately, The goal of the tariffs is going to be number one. Um, to do what you know, after COVID, to bring manufacturing home. So from like a national security standpoint, we were never caught unprepared for like another pandemic from like an API standpoint.\n\n00:03:00,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n But also, I think Trump really wants to drive. A lot of those companies and a lot of those manufacturing back to the U. S. just to, you know, to fit with his broader theme of 'made in the USA for, you know, everything.' So sounds like, you know, maybe sometime next week we'll have— something out on this. For now, it's there's really no point in even really speculating on what it's going to be.\n\n00:03:30,530 [SPEAKER_4]\n Jeroen, Paul, you guys cover a variety of larger and smaller cap companies. I mean, how great of an issue is this for? for either cohort. I guess the XBI is down about 8% here week-to-date. Is that because of the tariffs? The general stock market weakness, or do you think it's? Uh, more to do with the specific challenges that we'll address in a moment.\n\n00:03:52,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n The FDA, I mean, maybe let me chime in quickly. I think it's a combination of both, because it's been a volatile and sadly eventful week for F. And we'll talk about that in a second. The tariffs are a big issue. The question is, what does this really mean?\n\n00:04:15,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, Eric, I think you alluded in our previous kind of email exchange that you've been talking to investors all week about this. I think what's so hard is to tease out what the impact is. Really going to be because it's going to depend so much on intercompany transactions where the IP sits within a company and how they shuffle literally the margin right between city areas. And so it's really not that transparent to us. So we're all going to be a little bit in the dark to really understand what the impact is really going to be.","char_start":0,"char_end":4388,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I think, in the grand scheme of all our industry's problems, this is not the most important thing— or even like top five on the list. Like, you know, I'm sorry to say, my Ceases. For you know, the last handful of months. And, you know, really, if you go back years.\n\n00:05:33,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n The bottom line is, I'm sad to say this, but like pretty much everybody but us.\n\n00:05:40,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Meaning, The general public and like every politician out there wishes that our industry was smaller, that our products were used less, and that the companies made a lot less money. Like, that is the central headwind that our industry faces.\n\n00:05:58,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n Until we fix the PR problem where we're all viewed as, quote unquote, big pharma and, like, everything is evil.\n\n00:06:06,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Profit-oriented and all of that. Um, until we start getting the public and legislators on our side.\n\n00:06:17,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n And do something about that central problem and headwind that we have. I think that tariff, like you know, are going to be issues for individual companies.\n\n00:06:28,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n going to cause chaos.\n\n00:06:30,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n Figure it all out and to build plants and everything, but um, I do not think it's the biggest issue for our industry.\n\n00:06:40,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, to that point, Brian.\n\n00:06:41,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Fairly fair. Go ahead.\n\n00:06:43,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, you go ahead, Nina, please.\n\n00:06:46,359 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's sort of a lesser of evil news rather than bad news, good news. Brad, I 100% agree that, as an industry, we have a significant PR problem. But some of that PR problem is a real disconnect from the reality of innovative research, really well-intended, extremely dedicated people working in all aspects— from discovery all the way through to manufacturing and commercialization. And what I worry about with respect to tariffs is we do have an incredible, incredibly global supply chain, and we don't need to go into the details of that. But whether it's, you know, starting materials, intermediates, or final product, almost every single drug that's important is manufactured all over the world. And so there will be effects for companies on. Revenue and EPS, but also on mindshare. I think we've evolved to an industry that is very short-term minded. And so we have a lot of leadership in revenue. Positive companies that need to naturally collaborate with the buy side to deliver next quarter's, next year's sales and earnings, and that's going to be a huge distraction—I think to uh focus and investment on discovery, R&D, enlightened innovation, and development.\n\n00:08:00,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I think we're going to see layoffs, I think we're going to see struggles to wrap rapidly in source manufacturing. And we don't have the skill base in the US to really support a lot of the innovative medicines that we use. So I think there are a lot of dominoes that will follow tariff, even as we hope that there will be some grand bargaining that reduces the financial impact.\n\n00:08:28,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n Paul, how are you seeing the impact of tariffs on your revenue generating companies? Is this more than a few cents of earnings? Is this something that you know, given our margin structure and cost of goods, that you really need to be worried about?\n\n00:08:41,419 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hi. Yeah, that's a good question. I guess it depends on the company, right? I mean, I was talking with Going back and forth with Neurocrine about it. And, you know, Neurocrine runs a 99% gross margin on Ingressa.","char_start":4090,"char_end":8420,"start_time":"00:04:46","end_time":null}

And, you know, Neurocrine runs a 99% gross margin on Ingressa.\n\n00:08:55,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n The costs there double. It's not; it doesn't really seem to matter the broader narrative on that stock, right? I mean, I feel like, for anything that's not a large cap, it feels like the narrative is often more around top line growth.\n\n00:09:09,090 [SPEAKER_1]\n Is there a key pipeline asset? And is the company an M &A target? And every debate feels like it's within three variations of those questions. I mean, I was going to just say that. Look, I mean, this isn't a hot take, right? Both of these things are super, super, super relevant. But like, for my conversations this week, it's been much more around the FDA. Maybe that's somewhat. Due to my coverage, because I cover some large caps, but a lot of SMID caps. And I cover a lot of companies that do rare genetic medicine stuff, not just in gene therapy, but even, you know, cedar companies that have agreements around biomarkers. I feel like that's an area where I keep hearing from people like.\n\n00:09:46,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n I keep hearing the refrain that people think. X or Y drug will probably be fine as it relates to their regulatory agreement. But how can I have the ability to really make high conviction bets or investments here or size investments here? When just like there could be another shooter drop with the FDA, like any time, right? Like I think people generally believe that, and we'll talk about this, right? But that Dr. McCary, as an FDA commissioner, has a lot of incentives that are still somewhat aligned with industry, right? Like he's going to mostly be judged on. You know, compartmentalize vaccines for a second. For drugs, how many drugs get approved? You know, it doesn't want to look like they're inefficient. Right? I mean, that would be against the whole premise of all of this. But I feel like, over the next handful of months, even if we do see still see drugs getting approved, I just think there's so much concern around what sort of shuffling is going to be at the FDA. Are more people going to leave? Are they going to miss deadlines over time? What's going to happen on the policy side next year?\n\n00:10:47,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n I feel like that's a huge overhang for hundreds of stocks theoretically, not to be hyperbolic.\n\n00:10:55,990 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, well, you've sent us down this pathway of our FDA discussion, so. I guess I would agree with you. My call volume is more slated to the FDA concern than to tariffs at this stage. I'm sure Brad would put. The FDA, a functional agency, is a top three consideration in his fears about the industry. Why don't you, Paul, recap for us? You know, a little bit of the news flow just for those listeners who may not be as aware of some of the changes. Dr. Marks. The layoffs, the restructurings, etc.\n\n00:11:26,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure, yeah, I'll keep it super brief. So, I mean, this all started um when I woke up Saturday morning or I guess it didn't start— started Friday night— but I woke up Saturday morning, we all did, right. We see Dr. Marks resigned. He has a resignation letter that is pretty eye-opening, right, about concerns around FDA transparency. He talks about vaccines. And going into this, I think there had been a concern from a lot of investors that You know, Dr. Peter Marks might not survive this administration and no one really knew how it was going to play out. I mean, I hear very different things from different people. Some people having conviction that he's going to be around and maybe they'll. merge CBER and CEDAR and others who say you can't buy any gene therapy stocks until we know what's going to happen, right? So a lot of different views from investors on the topic going into it. But ultimately, this was a big fear, right? And then, as you mentioned, Eric, right? I mean, you know, we had been hoping after seeing some stuff at HHS that were changes over the past few months that FDA might be protected, but then, you know, FDA is subject to broad layoffs, right?","char_start":8120,"char_end":12391,"start_time":"00:08:41","end_time":null}

From our perspective, there's a around who's actually losing jobs. It sounds like, Eric, you've had some more insight into that, which I'll be interested in hearing. And then we've seen more senior people leave, right? You know, Peter Stein, you know, some senior people senior ODAC folks. And I think the broader question now that people are going to be asking all of their companies on a week-by-week basis or in developmental stage biotech is, have your FDA conversations been consistent? We will talk about Denali. And one thing that was interesting was that they, um, they did file for some approval on Tuesday and they said that they talked to the FDA review team of theirs on Monday so that was like the most real-time feedback I heard from from anybody but, Yeah, I mean, I think we're all kind of wondering what does this look like next week? Yeah, there's discussion, Eric, right around. Restructuring the agency.\n\n00:13:22,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't know. I feel like I could report all the news, but I also feel like the news is changing every 12 hours. What would you add? What did I miss?\n\n00:13:28,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe every 12 minutes. Yeah, I mean, I agree 100% with you. It seems like the number one question we get asked is what direction is going. We are really at a fork in the road. On the one hand, we know there there's some concern that the agency is already broken, that we've destroyed the culture, ruined the the staff and leadership to a point that there is no return, and that now we're busy putting the pieces back together. On the other hand, I think a more bullish outlook might be that this organization needed some change. It was a little bit inefficient. Dr. Macri is coming in and he's a little bit of a libertarian who's going to. Continue to facilitate new drug approvals and usher them through in a pro-business fashion. I know I have a very strong view on this, but I'd love to hear from the group. And Brad, why don't you start us off on which direction we're going?\n\n00:14:24,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Bruce Booth had a long tweet yesterday or the day before. I think he really said it best.\n\n00:14:34,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n is You know, as big as the layoffs or making headlines, I think the biggest issue is we don't know whether FDA is going to get more stringent or less stringent. Like it could go either of those two polar opposite directions.\n\n00:14:53,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n Depending on which way it goes, it's going to have huge implications for all of us. So, I think that's the biggest question mark right now: is there really no policy guidance on literally which direction, left or right, things are going? That's what concerns me the most.\n\n00:15:14,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I have the highest respect for Peter Marks and I feel terrible for all of the people who've been laid off and, you know, their lives have gone through upheaval. I will say, though, that, like, once early in my life. I worked somewhere that went through like a 50% layoff.\n\n00:15:36,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n At that moment. Um, it was devastating and you would have said, 'There is no way this place will ever bounce back. It's impossible.' Think of all the knowledge that went out the door.\n\n00:15:50,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n It was a pretty rough six months to a year.\n\n00:15:54,680 [SPEAKER_3]\n But ultimately it did bounce back, so I would say it's sad as it is for good people that got wrapped up in this and lost their jobs and everything. I wouldn't discount the ability of you know, of people to step up and, you know, get the job done ultimately over the long term. Anything that has to do with politics, given how polarized we are, the shouting as this news comes out makes it. Even worse. So I'm more concerned about like the policy direction and the lack of any clarity on that than I am as bad as I feel about it. The actual like numbers, because I would.

And I truly hope that. that it plays through that way. Also agree that the lack of an overarching master plan across many, many fronts right now, but certainly at the FDA is a critical concern. What troubles me about the departures, and it's not just marks, it's Hiller-Martinson, the chief medical officer of the FDA, folks that have 15 plus years of tenure in national public health and FDA regulatory.\n\n00:17:26,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n What we always talk about is how the markets hate uncertainty, but we also hate delays. And it's. It's been very difficult over the last decade to see the buildup, encouraging, but taking time to build up the technical acumen to deal with novel modalities, more complex conditions. Conditions in the setting of multiple baseline therapies to demonstrate effect and a greater understanding of the use of biomarkers in surrogates. And I think the fear I have is the loss of that institutional memory and history and how to lead in the context of that complexity.\n\n00:18:05,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Layoffs and we know this from you know um invested companies— it's difficult to recruit into organizations that have undergone a lot of uncertainty and flux, because people don't know what the future holds and they don't know whether that new position will be a secure position. So I worry that we're going to have significant delays and some real backtracking in places of innovation, whether that's NCAS orphan drug or Celgene, et cetera.\n\n00:18:36,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm kind of agreeing with both of you because I'm looking at the end of the day, and many of us remember, like the oh I think it was the 05 to 07 uh time frame, remember when no drug almost felt like approved, the companies would even hear back on PDUFA dates. And the FDA at the time was fairly dysfunctional. We've had an amazing 15-year run with a very functional FDA, you know, for the most part, certainly in the last decade. And I think once you look—my dual thinking is once you actually look underneath who left, and let me, I'm just going to run through a few names. I mean, we all heard about Peter Stein, O &D, but it's much more. broader, literally at the division level, the cardiology had Norman Stockbridge left, division of diabetes, Pat Arkajdian left. um endo Naomi Lowey's left and Farrell left. I mean this goes this goes broader, obviously we've heard about Bob Temple.\n\n00:19:37,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, I don't think I've mentioned Dr. Throckmorton, Deputy Director of Regulatory Programs. Those people, a lot of them, some of them, historically were criticized by biotech. Of the divisions, historically cardio and endo, remember— we all used to say back in the days: 'Don't ever go through endo because you'll never get through neuro.' Actually, is having a change as well. Well, now. But a lot of these divisions have now gotten a lot better in the last 10 years, and they've been very functional. And to your point, Nina, a lot of those leaders have been there. When those divisions were virtually impossible. And they've now shepherded those divisions to being very sort of reasonable, progressive, and innovative. So that institutional base is an issue. Some of the people who've been there for a long time. I'm leaving, hopefully, and it's going to be important to recruit or have talent that can take on the reins again and and maybe you know be innovative and press forward and maybe at the end this is going to work out okay.

And I think that's what we're going to have to work on now.\n\n00:20:48,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, let me just jump in here. And Paul, I'll let you have the last word on the FDA topic since you started this discussion. But Brad, Nina, Jeroen, I agree with everything you said. We've certainly got. lot of turnover that we need to correct. We've got a lot of lost information and know-how. We've got a dearth of leadership, but maybe one thing you guys haven't talked about is new leadership. And I actually think that may be the. the biggest concern for the agency right now, the lack of a a positive tone from the top, if you will.\n\n00:21:22,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n You're a stock analyst or you're a biotech TV guy or you're a venture capitalist. You show up to work one day and your boss or your boss's boss says, 'You know what? I don't believe in equity research anymore. I don't believe in the media and biotech anymore. I don't believe in.' Private companies are investing anymore. What do you do? And that's unfortunately what's happening right now with the FDA. There is this tone from the top that, if you believe Peter Marks, and I have no reason not to believe him, is politically driven and anti-science in its agenda. We know that people at the FDA are analytical and scientifically driven, to separate the truth from facts or the truth out of the facts that they see. To me, I think we're in for, unfortunately, a huge cultural change until something maybe different happens. Paul, why don't you jump in.\n\n00:22:17,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, it's well said. I don't really have much to add on that point. I mean, how can you really debate the meaning of Dr. Marks's letter? I think it was pretty clear. I think the one thing I'll just say, and we can leave it at that, and it feeds into the Denali mention, was just— you know— we're trying to look ahead and say, 'Okay, what are some of the catalysts that are coming up that will tell us how the FDA is functioning? There's really obvious ones, right? Like, are they meeting timelines? Some of the interesting ones are going to be companies that are filing now or just filed with regulatory agreements that were pushing the bounds of precedent on flexibility.' So I think of Ultragenyx with their Sanfilippo gene therapy, Regenyx with their Hunter gene therapy, and Denali with their transferrin enzyme conjugate and Hunter syndrome. All three of these are programs that are being filed for excluded approval based on a biomarker— a CSF biomarker in this case, heparin sulfate— in the backdrop of a disease area, right. Lysosomal storage where historically you've largely needed clinical data to get FDA approval, placebo-controlled clinical trials, right?\n\n00:23:23,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n So they're not going to have perfect read-through to the broader sector. I mean, everything is nuanced, but. You know, I think it's, and a lot could change between how these decisions later this year. But I think it would just be interesting to see how these play out because, you know, again, a lot of these companies in the rare genetic medicine space, you know, Nina, you're mentioning cell therapy, like it's our gene editing cell therapy. Like there's, there's going to be this open question of, is what you heard from the FDA in the past year. Still reigning true. And I can think of a few other companies I cover, like Dyn or NeuroGene, that you know, have plans to engage with the FDA to kind of reaffirm what they've heard. On potential regulatory paths. And what they had heard was not that long ago, right, and these meetings could be soon. And so I think there will be a lot of stuff that's coming up that will just not tell us just is the FDA working on time, but is the philosophy on flexibility consistent with what we've been seeing in the past year.\n\n00:24:18,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, great stuff to look out for. Nina, why don't you take us to another unfortunate topic of discussion, if you will, the measles outbreak.","char_start":19908,"char_end":24124,"start_time":"00:20:41","end_time":null}

Nina, why don't you take us to another unfortunate topic of discussion, if you will, the measles outbreak.\n\n00:24:28,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sure. This is sort of an interesting development over the course of the last couple of three months and sort of why we care about measles is that, you know, it's a highly contagious viral infection, preventable through vaccination, but highly infectious and does have morbidity and mortality associated with it. Mostly affects kids, you get, you know, cough, conjunctivitis, rash, white spots in your mouth, but severe morbidity and mortality is associated with pneumonia and cephalitis. So the seriousness of this as a public health concern dates back, you know, to the turn of the uh the the 20th century. And a measles vaccine was first introduced in 1963. So we've had a pretty long history of vaccination. But before then, you had 400 to 500 deaths per year. And I pulled a Lancet study that showed that. It's estimated that 93. 7 million, so almost 94 million deaths between 74 and 24 were prevented by the MMR vaccine, which is pretty compelling.\n\n00:25:29,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thank you. But in the last couple of years, we've seen a resurgence because of the growing incidence of vaccine hesitancy combined with global travel, bringing infected individuals in contact with underdiagnosed Americans.\n\n00:25:43,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n We know about measles epidemiology because it's mandatory reporting. If you have a suspected case as a clinician, you have to report that to your state or your local health department. And once it's confirmed by a viral titer, that's mandatory reported to the CDC. And what's been going on in the US due to a cluster in Texas and Gaines County, mostly associated with uh conscientious or religious objection to vaccination, is the start of several outbreaks. An outbreak is when you have three or more cases. So we now have about 500 cases confirmed cases of measles, which is a gross underestimation, likely because contact exposed and people who don't actually get virally titred wouldn't be counted in these CDC data. And that's across 20 different states, but heavily concentrated in Texas. And 93% of the cases are associated with those outbreaks.\n\n00:26:39,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n And there are five, and largely that's Texas, adjacent New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Um, so the concern is that this is twice as many cases and significantly more morbidity than we had all of last year. So the trend. For less vaccination, less immunity is higher. And it's super infectious. 12 to 20 people are likely to get infected if exposed to a sick individual. So it spreads kind of like wildfire. The concern that brought to heightened attention, other than what is the status and attitudes around vaccination, is some commentary from the administration and specifically from HHS Secretary Kennedy. Who first of all, made some recommendations for treatments that are completely inappropriate, but also went on Hannity to say that the vaccine is very risky, that it has the same symptomatology as having measles itself and that it has a fatality rate associated with it, which is concerning misinformation\n\n00:27:44,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n and potentially contributes further to vaccine hesitancy. So uh. So those are the thoughts on what's going on with measles and what's to be expected.\n\n00:27:59,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, that's a great recap. Thank you, Nina.\n\n00:28:02,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n Brad, Jerome, Paul, I'm going to put you all on the spot a little bit here.\n\n00:28:06,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n Nina mentioned RFK Jr.'s reaction to the outbreak.\n\n00:28:10,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n What does it mean that a secretary of HHS is performing as he is?\n\n00:28:17,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n um your thoughts on on whether He's.\n\n00:28:21,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n the right guy for this job.\n\n00:28:28,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I think it goes without saying that he's, given what we know about science, he's not the right.","char_start":23824,"char_end":27941,"start_time":"00:24:18","end_time":null}

And maybe the organization does need to get streamlined, maybe needs to get more efficient, maybe needs to, and I'm talking about HSS more broadly. But there's a lot of change happening really quickly in multiple, multiple divisions and multiple offices. And it's not coordinated at all. And there's no— doesn't seem to be a plan about how do you staff and how do you reorganize?\n\n00:29:09,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that's going to happen. We just discussed it. It's going to have long-term implications.\n\n00:29:14,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n On the food side, maybe there's going to be some positive changes.\n\n00:29:21,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, the whole concept of making America great with a different thinking, there's got to be good there. But there's got to be a plan of, you know, how do you reduce that to practice and how do you make it work? So, you know, we'll have to see.\n\n00:29:36,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I think if I can jump in just with a quick sort of footnote to your round, I think into your questionnaire.\n\n00:29:43,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because I think this is not just about. FDA, it's also oversight. of CDC and public health institutions and the importance of tracking so we understand what's going on, tracking not just cases of infectious disease, preventable infectious disease, but also accurate and thoughtful tracking of vaccination rates so that we can track where the population's you know protection level is you know for for mmr you need for measles you need you know 95 um vaccination rate to get to herd immunity which is which is pretty darn high but but we need that data as well so i'm thinking about the collateral effects of an hhs secretary that is you know skeptical I don't have any comment on this.\n\n00:30:30,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I don't know. Well, maybe my comment is just, how can I not agree with your own and Nina and what everyone has said, right? I mean, I think it's. To me personally, I mean, I have, you know, I have a three-year-old and another kid on the way. Like, the vaccine stuff spooks me, right? I mean, I, you know. I don't want to I don't want to have to worry about measles from kids. Like, you know, there's a million things you can worry about with little kids. And I do think about a lot of things. And this was not one I expected to be thinking about. So just even outside of that, like. Yeah, I mean, I feel like. I feel like there's I feel like this lowers this whole dynamic of the measles outbreak. I mean, it puts many people at harm. It shouldn't be at harm. But for just everyday individuals, I mean, it can reduce quality of life and increase stress. And then, as it relates to the FDA, I mean. I feel like it's interesting, right? I mean, I feel like a lot of times when we think about politics and regulation, there's this sort of paradox between or this tug between regulation and deregulation.\n\n00:31:33,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, whatever you think about all of that, I mean, consistent regulation with the FDA is so like, I guess what I was trying to say is that you know, people sometimes kind of associate increased regulation as being a headwind for business. Whereas, you know, we don't want the FDA to be remarkably strict, but we want it to be super predictable and science-driven. And we want reliable regulation in this sector because without that, we don't really have a sector.\n\n00:31:58,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think, Eric, your point about everyday lives is also what makes it important for us to sort of lean in and speak up as citizens. I'm thinking of a friend who's a new mom who's debating the safety of travel to introduce baby to more family and to friends because you can't get your first MMR dose until 12 months. And this wouldn't be a concern, you know. 15, 20 years ago when we declared measles as essentially eradicated. So she said it's a little bit like being back in COVID where you're wondering what's safe to where is it safe to be or if people recall Zika as well.\n\n00:32:32,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's my discussion with my wife, exactly.","char_start":27641,"char_end":32137,"start_time":"00:28:17","end_time":null}

And some kind of a master plan as to what this new reality or what these new offices are going to look like.\n\n00:32:46,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Meanwhile, Ginni Morozzo, she replaced Fauci. Nina, you have a dog named Fauci. She replaced Fauci at the NIAID, and she was put on leave now three days ago. So I think that's what we really need to see is what is the master plan here is. In the absence of it, it's concerning.\n\n00:33:06,960 [SPEAKER_4]\n Let me ask, while we're waiting for this master plan, and Nina, you mentioned you think the industry ought to stick up for itself and maybe get a little bit more vocal. I was on a call this morning with Dr. Califf, former FDA commissioner, of course.\n\n00:33:21,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n He called us cowards, he said, 'you know, we're not doing our job to to try and enact change, you know, the industry.\n\n00:33:29,810 [SPEAKER_4]\n Lobbying organizations to some extent have been criticized in other circles for being a little bit too passive.' Do we feel that that is the case?\n\n00:33:42,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n I certainly have that feeling or perception. But on the other hand, I want to give a lot of smart, earnest, passionate colleagues the benefit of the doubt that there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than what is visible in terms of trying to negotiate for. Whether it's economic policy around tariffs or whether it's about, you know, standards and challenges around the regulatory bodies. I'm surprised at lack of a louder outcry about NIH funding to our research institutions because that's such an essential engine of innovation for the pharma industry.\n\n00:34:20,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n But I'm hopeful that there is some earnest championing, lobbying, policymaking that's happening behind the scenes. But circling back to Brad's point, it certainly doesn't help our PR. It doesn't help us stand out as the champions of public health and human thriving that generally the biopharma industry you know should be, can be.\n\n00:34:44,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, whatever firm is—pharma— messaging is going to be.\n\n00:34:50,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n is going to be reversed and criticized by everyone if they start speaking up about this. Everyone not everyone but like the you know what— what like the masses are going to say, 'Oh, you know. They want to protect their monopoly and you know all of that whereas they say nothing. You get called cowards.\n\n00:35:12,680 [SPEAKER_3]\n The pharma industry has zero moral authority right now— like less than zero. It is the most hated industry in the in society right now. So it's like I don't see how, speaking up, is going to score any points or accomplish anything.\n\n00:35:33,600 [SPEAKER_4]\n That's a great point. What about the investment community? Year-round, and— and And Paul, I mean, we've got a lot at stake here. Maybe we don't have any credibility similar to the pharmaceutical industry, but. But should we be more vocal, more organized?\n\n00:35:51,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't think. I don't think I don't think we're empathetic figures, ultimately, right? I mean, I don't, you know, I mean, I I would worry that if a lot of Wall Street started speaking out, that might embolden the other side. Maybe that's too pessimistic.\n\n00:36:09,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I'm just not, I just question the impact. And I also think, you know, we have You know, we have a job to do, which is we try to help investors, you know, understand this stuff and make decisions and make the right decisions and think through risks. And I always get wary of, you know, having any sort of written investment research go beyond that. Maybe there's a time for it, but I-I just, I don't know. It's like, I don't know if I, if I wrote something like that, I don't know if people really care what I, what I think more broadly, you know, I just, I just don't know. What were you going to say? You're on.\n\n00:36:40,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n I was going to say, look, I completely hear you, and I agree, Paul, with your hesitation.","char_start":31837,"char_end":36191,"start_time":"00:32:32","end_time":null}

To me, it sounds like Trump at this point in the administration, specifically Trump, is really— about his legacy and what is he going to leave behind.\n\n00:37:02,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n And there's an America first policy, right? There is obviously a policy of change in the government broadly and obviously tariffs. and he is absolutely aware that this is going to wreck the stock market right now and it's going to have profound change and he came in pretty organized this time around. And we all knew that it's going to be organized. That was unquestionable, given everything that we knew was being done. So I guess I hear you and I agree, Eric, that we do need to be vocal. We need to be vocal about rights in general.\n\n00:37:38,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n But I guess I just don't know how much that's going to change because I think they've anticipated this.\n\n00:37:44,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know the question is kind of what— what does this game look like in five innings?\n\n00:37:48,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I think that's a really good point because I think that, speaking of sports metaphors, there is an element of, regarding the industry and the the buy side, sitting a little bit on the sidelines, with the exception, obviously, of selling shares to try to get a sense of where is this really going to land? How much of tariffs, this pendulum swing. What is the organizational leadership of the agency going to be? Are there going to be collateral effects on Bidufa dates or not? So far, mostly not, except vaccines? So I understand a little bit of the hesitation of leaning in with what message, with what action. But I do think some areas where we collectively, both industry and finance, as vilified as we may be for our self-interest, where we can lean in is one. The drumbeat of building and maintaining trust in science. Uh, trust in science, medicine, facts, to educate about our industry, including our supply chains, and make visible investments in the skill base that's needed to bring more manufacturing back stateside.\n\n00:38:59,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, and then I think we're going to see, and this happened, you know, in 2008, it happened in 1314. When you have a dramatic backdraft of capital into early stage science, public, private, partnership, step in. And pharma did a phenomenal job creating institutions and sponsoring research and academia to keep that part of our vital, vital industry alive. And that's something that I think pharma needs to be doing and thinking about doing on a pretty short. short order.\n\n00:39:32,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Eric, I also wanted to say, and I'm uh certain that I'm speaking for everyone on this call and in our industry. I want to give you and Josh credit um for speaking up earlier this week. I think for individuals, that's the way you should live your life— speaking up and standing up for what you believe in. In your case, you certainly have difficult circumstances to do that. Not everybody would have done that in your position.\n\n00:40:06,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think, as individuals, the worst thing you can do in life is to you know, be scared about rocking the boat or not saying what you mean. And I thought it took a lot of courage and I thought it was refreshing that you guys did that. So thank you.\n\n00:40:21,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Have a great year. Yeah, Eric. You guys deserve a lot of props.\n\n00:40:24,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thanks guys. I really appreciate that. I mean, look, it's uh... I'll just say, what drove us to to write the piece if you haven't seen it, we did suggest that Peter Marks was unfairly fired and we also went so far as to question whether Secretary Kennedy should be kept in his position. But Nina, something you said is really, I think, relevant to my thought, which is: We have science on our side and science is always the truth, right? So as long as we stick by that guiding light, that science is indisputable. I think we have stronger ground on which to stand and stand together and certainly appreciate the support from this group and from some of the others that have reached out to us.

Maybe you can refresh us on what happened with Baxite and very substantial share downdraft there.\n\n00:41:34,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep, um, yeah, so this was on Monday, and so this is for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. They've been testing theirs in both adults and children.\n\n00:41:48,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n They had a pretty good trial success in adults and this news on Monday was about children.\n\n00:41:55,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, everyone's watching the vaccine space you know very closely ever since the election outcome. Sadly, this was like a $140 stock. Um, you know, the summer of last year when when nobody was thinking about any of this and it was like 70 riding into the week. It's gotten basically thawed in half— and basically, the issue here is that there's a handful of stereotypes that missed in this study. And by the way, I'm not like a vaccine expert.\n\n00:42:31,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n But a lot of the research that I've read basically suggests that. You know, this was a phase two study. And when they move this into the pivotal, they can kind of adjust the formulation and either add more serotypes or boost. Sum up and so some of the analysts work that I read on this suggests that this may not be a lost cause and they still might be able to succeed.\n\n00:42:59,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't think this has any read through into like you know the whole debate is like are vaccines uninvestable or anything like that. I think this was just trial result that underwhelmed and didn't hit its mark. And I would say there's actually been some positive vaccine stories in the news lately. Like, I don't know if you guys saw the paper about the shingles vaccine and maybe holding off dementia in adults. And so, hopefully, not everything will get embroiled in the controversies of what we've been talking about lately. But in this case, it was like— you know, a company that was on thin ice to begin with, just given the overall sentiment and, you know, had a disappointing trial result.\n\n00:43:54,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, in the pediatric, uh, you know, population— certainly a tough environment to report negative data out on. Uh, speaking which, Paul, all the edgewise data set was this. Mediocre to negative data or was this a market reaction?\n\n00:44:12,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Maybe in between. I mean, I think it's also there's a sort of structural, I think, lesson here on certain types of investment setups and tough markets. And I'll get to that in a second. But essentially, edgewise, for those who for those who don't know the story, is.\n\n00:44:29,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n He's developing a drug for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I mean, this is a space where we have Mavacantin as a commercial drug for Bristol, which is doing pretty well after a solo launch. Cytokinetics, who's under regulatory review. With another next-generation drug, and then edgewise is the third generation, and as you go across the spectrum, the thesis in each of these follow-on drugs is they get safer and safer, and kind of alleviate some of the echocardiograph monitoring in the real world that are impediments to use with MAVA.

A colleague of mine, James Kondoulas, who was my associate, and now has started covering the cardiology space.\n\n00:45:07,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n Previewed this edgewise catalyst, and he was a little bit more cautious because just because of the view that the safety hurdle is really high, especially from cytokinetics, and the view that going into this data, it was a small data set and it's hard to disprove the negative on a safety regulatory thing in a small data set. And so far, it looks like that rang true. Their initial data, the drug looks very active on various cardiac biomarkers, like they looked at NT-proBNP and KCCQ and other echo parameters. But they did see a couple cases of AFib. Which are hard to interpret because this can happen as a background event in HCM, but it also could be drug related. And I think. It leaves investors a little bit guessing, a little bit needing more data, and you know—again. I think it's it's that broader context too. Where you know, my colleague James knows so much more about the stock than I do. But my thought is, when you have a drug that has a specific safety thesis within a group at the FDA, or at least the FDA, as we know it, that is very conservative on safety, and you need a lot of data to disprove the negative.\n\n00:46:12,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's a tricky stock setup, especially in a market that feels like it can be more inclined to be a sell-and-use market right now. And so that's what happened. They did actually a wall-cross financing.\n\n00:46:23,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n The stock broke price on that pretty quickly.\n\n00:46:28,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, and then another data set in the cardiovascular space. Nina, I think you were going to discuss Lilly's lepidoceran, which is targeted against LP little a, and Jeroen, you had some follow-on comments there too.\n\n00:46:43,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, so just a reminder that LpA is a similar lipoprotein to LDL, but it's got an additional apolipoprotein attached to it that gives it a structural alteration that makes it independently prothrombic and atherogenic. And so, even with kind of best statin management, cholesterol lowering, you can still see independent risk for major cardiac events. And I personally care about it because this runs in my family. It's 90% genetically determined. And in my case, both my older brothers have had major cardiac events, including one has had a major event following maximal cholesterol lowering, including the addition of Repatha. So there is an unmet need. And there are three interesting nucleic acid drugs in development: Ionis, Novartis, Amgen, and Amgen. And what's exciting about Lilly, also just a shout out to Doug Fambro from Dicerna. This is a Dicer substrate RNA that's quite different from other siRNA approaches in its penetration activity in the hepatocytes.\n\n00:47:52,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n and it, um, has shown a dramatic lowering in phase one, and healthy volunteers was just slightly elevated. LP little a, and then they just reported out phase to study in some 380 patients, 140 of which were given combined high dose either once or two doses six months apart, and it showed about 400 milligram.\n\n00:48:18,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n dose, a dramatic 93. 5% lowering of LP little a, enough so that at that six months sort of interim time point, they triggered off their phase three study, which is now enrolling. And what's also, I think, noteworthy is the inclusion criteria of the phase two study really had a pretty high level. of LP little a, about 175 nanomoles per liter, and best stable management on other cholesterol-lowering medications. So it was a really good substrate population to study this in. And then the phase three is kicking off to. To do, uh, you know, cardiac, um, cardiovascular outcomes, which is where, uh, Amgen and Artis are with their phase three trials, uh, looking at MACE Mason points.\n\n00:49:10,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n So exciting progress, exciting for siRNA, exciting for people with Lp, and potentially a really innovative new cardiovascular target and modality that's gaining not just a genetic validation, but now real clinical validation.\n\n00:49:28,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay. Go ahead, Jeroen. What did you learn about the Ionis-Navis trial?","char_start":43407,"char_end":47808,"start_time":"00:45:07","end_time":null}

Go ahead, Jeroen. What did you learn about the Ionis-Navis trial?\n\n00:49:33,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. So this is probably the next uh major area in innovation in cardio and, literally, by the way, with LePo they're going into primary prevention. Thank you. Um, Right now, Novartis, that's the Horizon study that we're about to talk about. That's secondary prevention. Amgen with Olpaceran is also secondary prevention. Amgen said they're going to start a primary prevention study this year. In phase two, Novartis is testing both pellicarsin for LpA, along with Lecvio, their every six months PCSK9, for primary prevention. That's in phase two, though, and they have not announced their primary prevention strategy. Presumably, I think it's going to come this year. Lily just also has an oral drug.\n\n00:50:19,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n I always butcher how to say it. Muvalaplin. That's an oral small molecule in phase two. Also showed a greater than 86% reduction. reduction, and then AstraZeneca and CSPC from China. I think they're expected to go into phase one soon with an oral.\n\n00:50:37,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n What came out over the weekend is the horizon baseline demographics. That's the phase three that we're expecting the CVOT primary endpoint to hit second. half this year, but they said that events are happening slower than expected. So it's going to be next year in the first half. Over 8,300 patients.\n\n00:50:57,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n where Amgen enrolled about almost 7,000 in 14 months. I mean, just to give you what Nina said, this is a huge population out there. The baseline level— Remember, anything over 90 is considered a very high risk, or anything over 70 is elevated. They were at 108 at baseline, so very high-risk population. Obviously, well-managed on LDL. 80% had prior MI, 10% had prior stroke, 14% had peripheral artery disease.\n\n00:51:28,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n Why is that relevant? It's relevant because the ancient primary endpoint is only MI and hospitalization and death. They don't include stroke.\n\n00:51:38,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n There was that stroke— just does not happen much. So that was the one risk with the Pellett-Parson program. So it's good to see that only 10% had prior stroke because it's not expected to contribute much to that endpoint. And it's at 90% power to show a 20% benefit. So a very well conducted study.\n\n00:51:56,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, the knock on pellet carson is it only reduces uh, LP little a by 80, but look, that's gonna be even down 80 from you know 108 is going to get you to 20, right? So that's going to be well, well within the normal range. Um, it is a monthly auto injector. The other ones are either quarterly or as Nina said, Amgen is you know, can be even less frequently, and then Lily can be, I think, it's like two shots and maybe even a shot every six months or every year. So there's going to be a lot of uh, a lot of innovation, a lot of good drugs, uh, and look, I think a lot of people on Wall Street are skeptical it's going to work. But all our consultants unanimously have said everybody's Expecting it to work. We're pretty bullish. We think it's going to be a big market.\n\n00:52:39,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n Take your own. Can I ask you a question about that? Because it sounds like you've spent more time on this than I have. But, you know, with Ionis, which I think you also cover, right, there's this. There's this push and pull with Ionis where they have a number of compelling shots on goal, but for each of these shots on goal, there could potentially, or not each, excuse me, for many of these shots on goal, there could be a better drive on the horizon, right? If this study works, how are you thinking about that? Do you think Ionis gets the credit, or do you think there's just immediately the competitive overhang like we've seen? TTR, the triglyceride market that's sort of been the structural challenge for ASOs in the liver.","char_start":47508,"char_end":51648,"start_time":"00:49:28","end_time":null}

TTR, the triglyceride market that's sort of been the structural challenge for ASOs in the liver.\n\n00:53:15,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, yeah, good, really good questions. Um, let me reverse engineer the question first because you said TTR. Well, TTR— the good news is they're actually going to be the late entrant, right with their data second half next year. And they learn from everybody else. So their study, as we all know, CardioTransforms is, you know, two and a half times bigger than Helios B. And that's going to be power to really look at everything. So while they might end up being two years away from, you know, to market, they might actually come out with a better data set than Invutra.\n\n00:53:45,259 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, we were originally worried about embouchures, you know, going to the muse every three months, you go to the doctor. Um, whenua, which is their drug with Astrazeneca, is monthly but it's an auto injector and patients love the auto injector— it's like Ozempic. So they're capturing actually a huge amount of share very quickly in PN. Um, which is already approved. I think they already have 40 of new starts within a year, so the auto injector is actually going to be pretty compelling. I think we could also learn a little bit a couple of things. So, number one, to answer your first question: let's learn from PCS K9. Number one, it's going to take a long time for these drugs to be big because it's going to take time to get reimbursement. Whereas with LDL, there were generic drugs, so insurance was able to fight back. As Nina mentioned, this is genetically totally independent of LDL. Insurance won't be able to fight back much with CVOT outcomes.\n\n00:54:37,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, to your point, too.\n\n00:54:40,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n All of these LP little a drugs are pursuing, you know, prospective cardiovascular outcome studies. And that was really, you know, significantly lacking with the PCSK knives on initial, on initial launch. And so it makes it very easy for. for insurers to push back despite the validation of LDL lowering.\n\n00:54:58,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n Exactly. So they'll have outcomes right away. um and then look amtion was the first one out was ripatha they're still the market leader i think they have 80 share so hopefully first to market is important let's be a is every six months. It does lack outcomes, as Nina just alluded to also. And they've not captured a lot of share. But what we're hearing a lot out there is that people love the autoinjector and cardiologists don't love this buy and bill model.\n\n00:55:29,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm actually fairly positive here.\n\n00:55:35,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I own this.\n\n00:55:37,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n Interesting discussion.\n\n00:55:39,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thanks for that back and forth.\n\n00:55:42,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe we'll try and end on a little bit of a brighter note, given how downcast the markets are.\n\n00:55:49,010 [SPEAKER_4]\n And how dour a week it's been. Nina, do you want to talk to us about some deal flow and fundraising bright spots?\n\n00:55:58,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, you know, a bright spot, but again, perhaps bright by extreme exception, was the huge funding round— the first publicly announced outside financing round for Isomorphic Labs. The Google DeepMind spin out in the UK. They raised $600 million. It's led by Thrive Capital. And GV and Alphabet co-invested as well.\n\n00:56:20,830 [SPEAKER_0]\n As is the case for many of these computationally driven deep science startups, there's not a ton known when they first come onto the scene and operate a little bit in. in stealth, but a $600 million war chest leveraging now AlphaFold3 for doing not just protein resolution and prediction, but also protein ligand interaction studies is a pretty powerful use case and tool set. For drug discovery, the cup half full in me. Loves seeing that kind of capital put to early-stage discovery science. And you've got a team—ismorphic, although started by you know a um a cognitive neuroscientist, more of a sort of computational person, and helmed, they've brought in leadership that comes from industry as well. So my hope is that that combined.","char_start":51348,"char_end":55696,"start_time":"00:53:15","end_time":null}

So my hope is that that combined.\n\n00:57:18,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n As well as, of course, their scientific advisory board— as well puts them in a place to be not just advancing technology, but really converting that into drugs and giving lift to the whole notion of it. AI-enabled for a discovery for the space. Interesting too, that it's Thrive Capital that led it. We've seen more crossover or tech-diversified funds playing more in AI in healthcare, whether it's in the pharma side or in you know, service delivery or decision support.\n\n00:57:50,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thrive and Sequoia have been two, you know, major leading check writers. So it'll be interesting to see.\n\n00:57:55,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n Uh, what that revolution portends is as well in terms of the the actual players, and in terms of other bright spots, Paul, you mentioned earlier that Denali filing for Thank you. I2S, I guess, for Hunter's disease. I don't know if you have any other further comments you wanted to make, your own. I think you alluded to at least the. Amgen, a Plinza. FDA.\n\n00:58:17,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n of their new indication. Um, It's nice to see the progress. Would either of you like to comment further?\n\n00:58:24,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Denali's drug is an important drug. And, you know, on Tuesday, they filed for excluded approval. And the immediate question is.\n\n00:58:32,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n How confident are you in your regulatory alignment that it still stands? Their response was, 'We talked to the FDA yesterday, right, on a crazy Monday.' So, I mean, that's encouraging. We think that's an important driving. Still likely to get through, barring any sort of major structural change of the agency that inhibits the FDA from doing things on time.\n\n00:58:53,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n And Paul, to that end, a recent conversation with Anil Kakas at Ultragenyx was also very encouraging about engagement with the agency, driving forward and not showing signs of worry there, which I think is positive. And then we had Cabo's neuroendocrine tumor label expansion as well for Exalexis on time, on schedule.\n\n00:59:14,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n Totally. Yeah. And that, that was actually even early—right, a few days early— which was great.\n\n00:59:18,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, a few days early, yeah.\n\n00:59:20,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then, Venrafia just got approved from Novartis without a black box or a RAMs— that's the endothelium a receptor antagonist. This is the Chinook acquisition for Ig nephropathy, and they got a very good label.\n\n00:59:34,839 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, you know, the FDA, I mean, at least it sounds like things that are late stage, they're very much on top of it. That's encouraging.\n\n00:59:43,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n Good. Well, I'm glad we could end on a positive note. Fingers crossed that we continue to see a functional FDA in terms of hitting their PDUFA dates and making the right decisions on new drug approvals. Brad, Nina, Yaron, Paul, thank you all for another wonderful session. I hope we can meet again in a week. I hope we still are all part of this glorious industry in a week from now.\n\n01:00:09,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thanks to you, Eric, and thanks.

Biotech Hangout, a live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry with a group of biotech insiders. I'm Chris Garabedian, and my co-hosts today are Brad Loncar. Eric Schmidt. Paul Mateus and Tess Cameron. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. So. You know, never adult moment. These days in biotech. Um, let's start with the markets—I mean it's been a roller coaster, to say the least. I know some of this was talked about on last week's, but it's continued into this week.\n\n00:00:39,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, Brad, maybe do you want to just frame this in terms of.\n\n00:00:42,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n how you're seeing the markets and then i wanted to go to eric on on kind of the the fun dynamics yeah i mean obviously as everyone knows it's a roller coaster and it all kind of came to a head when the white house pause the increases for 90 days for like everybody but china that day the you know markets rallied the dow was up like 2 500 points but it was weak yesterday and it's weak today and um I think one thing for people who don't follow markets, like one thing to note. Um, that I think matters a lot is that bond yields are rising and that's pretty concerning. Actually, you would expect the opposite because, like, during volatile times, the U. S. is usually a safe haven, and especially fixed income. And the fact that the dollar is weakening and those bond yields are going up suggests that people are are uh uninvesting in the U.\n\n00:01:50,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n S. and and you know taking their money elsewhere. And if that's a long-term trend, obviously that would be very concerning. Um. You know, I think the thing is, there's not to dive too deep into politics. I know there's a lot of people that are against the tariffs and there's people that see value in them and everything. I think one thing that\n\n00:02:16,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Probably most people would agree with is just the suddenness of all of this. And, you know, the US has always been like the steady hand. In terms of like financial markets and a place to invest your money. And so I think that one thing to watch closely is the fact that that all this has been so abrupt and you know whiplash and everything, if people start pulling their money from the U. S., not necessarily even as a directional bet, just because it's, you know, not as steady.\n\n00:02:56,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n The rules of the game aren't as durable as they used to be, that would be a very bad sign for the financial markets. And ultimately, that all trickles down and affects every sector, including ours.\n\n00:03:13,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. Well, Eric, I mean, you know, biotech is unique. It's driven a lot by specialty funds and specialty managers.\n\n00:03:24,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, they're not going to go away. It's the raison d'être to invest in. Follow biotech. But, you know, people who have money, right, they allocate differently. And that can— you know, they can choose not to invest as much into biotech. So what are you seeing in terms of kind of what's happening at the fund level?\n\n00:03:44,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n I like Brad's comment that the rules of the game are shifting. Right, I mean literally the earth is shifting underneath our feet, whether we want to admit it or not. Within biotechnology today, we've got these massive changes. The FDA is going to be very, very different from what we thought it might be. Have looked like just a few months ago, I'm sure we're going to talk more about that. Chris. We've got potential for tariffs. We've got potential for economic downturn. We're seeing lack of funding at the NIH.\n\n00:04:16,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n More broadly, at the scientific level. So what we thought was the game from an investment standpoint before is no longer the game. And this week, for example, Paul's joining us. I'm sure he will vouch for this. All of our incoming calls, uh, from biotech investors, had very little to do with specific companies, or timelines, or data points, or individual stock outlooks. They had everything to do with the macro, right? Everyone is suddenly had to put their their macro caps on and become a an economist or political scientist or international tax specialist.

We need to adjust, we need to react to the earth that is moving. But none of us really like doing that, that's for sure.\n\n00:05:12,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n And of course, when things swing this bad, the conversations often turn to, 'Okay, who's not going to survive, right?' For better or for worse, this sea change that is happening on Wall Street is going to leave certain funds unable to continue, certain companies unable to raise capital. Probably certain Southside shops as well, unable to support their their teams of analysts and bankers. This industry is probably shrinking as we. we see it right now. Maybe again, we're slow to appreciate it, but if this keeps up for much longer, I think the shrinkage will be very dramatic.\n\n00:05:53,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Unfortunately, you know, I know that's a bit of a downer to start today's discussion, but that's kind of the tone of Wall Street. Paul, do you want to chip in on that?\n\n00:06:01,390 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with anything, Eric. And I have a little anecdote from this week that just puts in perspective. How hard it is to be an investor right now. I was in San Francisco doing meetings and you know, each meeting it opens up with the same sort of 10-minute just. sigh of how much of a bummer this market is and then, about 45 minutes into one of them, you know, we're all looking at the TV that's about 30 feet away in the lobby of this office. We're like, is that the NASDAQ up 8%? And, you know, it's kind of. It works in a hedge fund, feels like he'll run back to his desk. Right. And so, I mean, just think about. That for a second, right? I mean, obviously, it has nothing to do with fundamental companies.\n\n00:06:40,240 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's just the market swings, I think, are making it really, really challenging for people. I mean, Eric, you know, I'm. I'm definitely. trying to entertain the kind of conversation with people of what types of stocks could do better in this market. I mean, I think we saw in the couple days after the Peter Marks news. this sort of Semi flight to safety of, okay, I want to own stuff that's commercial or. Late stage, and then you know. I mean, well, you know, that feels like it became a very short-term consensus trade quickly. I do feel like there's going to be certain types of criteria that investors are going to be more stringent on with with small stocks. Right. I mean, just talking to people about, you know, if the company has a catalyst like, you know, that's got to be a data catalyst in this market that really disproves one or two bear cases and is truly value creating. Right. Like nothing— proof of principle. I want something that is firmly proof of concept or firmly de-risking, or you know, companies that have been platform companies and burning a lot of cash. I mean, I think. You can be this spiral where the cash needs are high and then the stock goes down and then the implied dilution is greater and then the stock goes down more and so I'm finding investors being more sensitive to those types of names.\n\n00:07:47,510 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, the tariff piece makes the whole flight to commercial biotech more challenging in my discussions. No one even has any idea how to model this kind of stuff right now. But um, but this is just a window into these conversations I've been having. Which oftentimes don't have a good answer.\n\n00:08:03,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think, Paul, just to pick up on one piece that you said, which is—uh, you know, clear catalyst— and I think we're also seeing a change in, like, what is a catalyst, right? And I'd be interested in thoughts from others, but like, what is a catalyst? Because You know, I think there's very little.","char_start":4139,"char_end":8231,"start_time":"00:05:00","end_time":null}

Because You know, I think there's very little.\n\n00:08:21,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's very little forgiveness for even any like, minor kind of like confusing point in data. Right? Even if it's something that's really explainable and very logical. Um and I think that could understandably create a lot of anxiety for companies about, like, oh, my gosh, well, like, what does that mean in terms of, you know, how you're thinking about, you know, upcoming data and what you should, you know, what you should release. I mean, I think our um You know, our days of kind of like individual patient level data coming out in quick succession, that would not play well, in this market, right? And so I think it does really, kind of tend toward, you know, companies being in a position to, ideally, release, you know, pretty full, robust data sets, right, and really being able to contextualize those appropriately. Even if you do, there's anything that's you know, imperfect or difficult to explain, about those data sets, you want to make sure that like you're talking really, really closely to your top holders, right?\n\n00:09:32,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Because there's not going to be a lot of forgiveness from people who aren't super close to the story and willing to bear through some of those imperfections, even if they're not fundamental.\n\n00:09:44,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. Test. That's a good point. I know we're gonna cover Alexia later, that might kind of speak to this point a little bit. With their data and the stock reaction. But I want to bring it to a little bit to the private side.\n\n00:09:56,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n So Bruce Booth put a blog, he's always very timely with his blog posts in terms of highlighting that, despite all the uncertainty, all the challenges that we're facing, that this could be the best time. To really focus on new company creation, we hit kind of a 10-year or more than 10-year low. In terms of new company creation, but this also is counterbalanced with the fact that we've got more dry powder than we've ever had. There's been more fund closures. There have been articles about just funds closed in the last few years as more than $35 billion of capital to be deployed. And so we're still seeing. Uh, private deals, but you know it's a little bit of a controversial take to have a silver lining perspective on this. If you take a strictly long-term view, it makes sense. But at the end of the day, you know, VCs, they have to exit, and that means they have to get to data sets that will either elicit acquisition or they'll have to be patient with the IPO market.\n\n00:11:07,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n And presumably, if you have more data in our clinical stage and further along, it'll be easier to do an IPO if the window's healthy and open. But it's not stopping these VCs. And look, I run the VC funds for Perceptive Advisors, a multi-stage public equity investor.\n\n00:11:29,969 [SPEAKER_0]\n And uh, you know, we have to deploy capital. We have an investment period. We've raised a lot of money when we do capital calls. We need to pick our investments. So when you see these billions and billions of dollars that have been raised. They have to put that money to work. Now, they don't have to put it into Nucos. They can invest in Series Bs, Series Cs, and Series Es. But I think the idea is, hey, this could be a good time to invest in new companies now. Uh, I read Bruce, you know, full blog. I don't always have the luxury of reading Peter Kolchinsky's blogs because they're pretty long. Tests, and I know you help a lot with those, but Bruce has a you know more than a bite size. But, but I think one of the issues that I think is um at play here is, on the venture side, we have to reverse engineer on valuation. And you really are pegged to comparables in the public markets. And until we start to see the public valuations of biotechs get healthier.","char_start":7931,"char_end":12052,"start_time":"00:08:21","end_time":null}

And until we start to see the public valuations of biotechs get healthier.\n\n00:12:35,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's hard to reverse engineer. You know, how is everybody going to make money along the way from the seed investor to the series A to the series B to the crossover investors to the IPO investors? And that gets really challenged when valuations are. You know, they are not healthy, um, and particularly so. Bruce was making an argument for discovery, and I think the you know the economic model gets further challenged with discovery. Now we're all happy when we see the likes of flagship and companies that go into early technology. Arch has more of a business model.\n\n00:13:14,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n Platform play versus technology platform that Flagship likes to do. But those require a lot of capital to de-risk to get something ready for the clinic. I do think we need you to be an ecosystem that is very reliant on these public equity valuations and the IPO window. And I think that we really need to see some signs of life for that. And I think we're at peak uncertainty right now. But there are private deals still happening. One of them, we supported Merida, which is in the Graves. thyroid eye disease tests. I know you guys had a Series B that was an RA company embryo in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy space.\n\n00:13:53,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n Saw some other deals, Neurona, later stage at Sina, later stage Ray Thera is another series A over $100 million. So we definitely are reading that. You know, money's being deployed on the private side, but I think, you know, we're all pretty anxious about when will those exits come? What do we need to show to have an exit? Are there any further comments, Tess, coming from the? the private side of our age.\n\n00:14:20,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, no. Definitely. I think I think everything that you said makes sense. I think, you know, a key point for funds that are deploying both public and private capital, right? Just that the opportunity cost of that private capital went up pretty significantly with the market drawdown, right? As you say, I think every fund, whether you're exclusively private or a mix of public and private, does kind of shift the bar in terms of that private capital deployment. And you know, I think something that we'll just have to watch is like— you know how does that shift the um you know the the type of new co-formation that we see right and and how much does that involve uh you know kind of starting from scratch versus you know, we've seen a lot of, you know, we've seen a lot of asset in licensing. And I do think that, like, you know, for any new codes that are starting from scratch, it's a very different profile of the type of new code that was started from scratch a few years ago.\n\n00:15:21,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hey, Chris, I just want to quickly mention too, in terms of like, what can smaller companies do? I think there's another option out there that's been around for a while, but is really going to be at the forefront over the next year or two. So I was at a conference this week and I did a bunch of interviews and one of the most eye-opening ones I did was with one of the royalty companies like Everyone, of course, knows Royalty Pharma, but there's a lot of like midsize and smaller players in that space. And their phones are ringing off the hook right now. And.\n\n00:16:00,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n With the IPO window closed, if you're not getting like a big pharma deal, another option for smaller companies, even in earlier stages of development, like this is no longer just a business for somebody that has like a phase three success or is already commercial and is trying to monetize it or something, there's a lot of these royalty companies that will take some development risk and invest in an asset early on in development for future royalties.\n\n00:16:34,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n It sounds like they have lots of cash available right now. And so, if I was a smaller company trying to exhaust all options, I would look at that too. And I think we're going to be seeing a lot of those types of announcements over the next year, year and a half.","char_start":11752,"char_end":16102,"start_time":"00:12:35","end_time":null}

And I think we're going to be seeing a lot of those types of announcements over the next year, year and a half.\n\n00:16:49,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, Brad, just to follow up on that, I mean, it reminds me a little bit of venture debt, right? And Silicon Valley filled a goal there of kind of, you know, less de-risked company for venture debt. And so, on the royalty side, you know, when there's no clear clinical proof of concept evidence? Is it that they're just getting better and better deals and so it's a numbers game where they're willing to take a bunch of zeros?\n\n00:17:15,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, because I, you know, usually you see that more in play when something's de-risked, that, okay, this has a higher than. than average likelihood to get an approval. We can do our, you know, probability-adjusted cash flows on this based on the clinical data. But when, when you go into pre-clinical proof of concept, how are they, how are they managing that risk?\n\n00:17:37,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, they're just investing like a hedge fund would in a stock. They're doing the same thing in individual programs. And I think that makes a lot of sense. I think for a long time, like literally decades.\n\n00:17:50,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n Various people in our industry have tried to figure out, like vehicles that you could create to just invest in an asset if you don't like love a whole company. And I think that's essentially what these folks are doing.\n\n00:18:04,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n Another really interesting thing that they're starting to do is, look— we have a We have too many companies out there, like everyone knows the the negative enterprise value problem. You know, there's good companies out there that are experiencing that, but there's a lot of you know. I think Adam coined the term 'zombie companies' for the sake of the overall health of our industry. Like, they all need to get cleaned up, and the royalty companies can do that very efficiently in a way that like gives cover to like the board of directors of these companies. So they could basically acquire them, distribute the cash to the shareholder base. And then, for all of the preclinical or very early clinical assets that were still left in these companies, they have something to eventually license out if anybody wants to, like you know, pick it up and continue to develop it. But yeah, it's just uh— you know, they're investing in programs like—and taking risks just like we all have in individual companies in the past.\n\n00:19:09,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's just a more like microwave investing in the sector.\n\n00:19:13,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I think you need that critical mass. It reminds me of seed investing where you know that. A majority of will probably fail and never get to an exit. But you're you're hoping that the few that you do bet on. So, yeah, it'll be interesting to watch that that trend.\n\n00:19:26,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and I think maybe just one comment because we have You know, some of our portfolio companies, including some, you know, primarily later stage companies, have done those royalty deals. And it's so important to think through the nuances or understand the nuances of them because I think, Brad, what you're talking about is you know, royalty deals that are a bit more like equity, right? Where you're basically taking assets, and you have upside in those assets, and you have downside in those assets. Sometimes the way that these deals get structured— especially by some of the bigger players that also do a lot of debt deals— is the royalty deal is basically dead, right? Uh, you know, company wins, uh, you know, royalty, uh, you know, company wins to a certain extent, usually with the cab— the company loses. They still got to pay back the. You know, royalty, you know, the royalty pair. So it's a really interesting concept, I think. One that would have to be deployed with that kind of concept of you know, upside and downside in mind.","char_start":15802,"char_end":19940,"start_time":"00:16:34","end_time":null}

All right, well, look— the markets, I think every week we're going to be monitoring this touch and go, both public and private. But you know, FDA is a big part of that and what's happening at the FDA. Eric, you want to kick us off on 'What's the latest week' and any perspectives further, just with all the changes that we've seen?\n\n00:20:47,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, obviously, from a macro standpoint, this week's stock weakness probably had a lot more to do with tariffs and the threat of tariffs. More broadly and on biopharmaceuticals than on anything else. But the FDA discussion that arose and came to the fore last week with Peter Marks' dismissal. In the background, at least, that continues to percolate. This week, for example, we saw a number of former FDA leaders, including Janet Woodcock, come out very vociferously against the change.\n\n00:21:19,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n And very fearfully in terms of what might transpire going forward. She wasn't the only one. Of course, we continue to hear RFK Jr., our secretary of HHS, make comments. I think he went on TV and essentially admitted that he's been interfering to a certain extent with COVID vaccine approval from Novavax and And he said some untruths about that vaccine and about single antigen respiratory vaccines in general that are just not correct so that was a very disappointing revelation this week. And then we were starting to at least see Dr. Macri, who's the current FDA commissioner, come out and begin to. maybe institute some of his agenda. It was a very, very minor pilot program that he put forth on. preclinical testing initiative that's been going on at the FDA for now many months, and he may be brought to the fore. But perhaps he's starting to begin to establish his presence there. Lots of changes, I think, in terms of the investment community.\n\n00:22:24,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n um we're still very anxious here we think the FDA is for the most part hanging in the balance.\n\n00:22:31,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't think there are too many of us that already are willing to say the FDA is truly, truly broken.\n\n00:22:37,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think a majority of us do think that there is severe damage that's been inflicted on the FDA.\n\n00:22:45,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n That damage will probably continue to be inflicted on the FDA so long as the leadership in our country and our government is unwilling to stand up for science. It is unwilling to stand up for an independent drug review process. It is unwilling to protect the non-political appointees, giving them freedom to make scientific judgments. That's a very tenuous position, and I'm curious to hear how others have reacted to this week's news.\n\n00:23:16,330 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe I can chime in, Eric. I mean, I think. From a societal perspective, like, I agree with everything you're saying, and you know, we talked about it last week. I mean, all the vaccine stuff is super disconcerting for a variety of reasons. I did talk to some Some investors this week who are maybe less pessimistic, just as it relates to, um, just as it relates to, like, maybe a lot of the non-vaccine companies, you know, I mean, I think we've seen a big basket of development stage biotech companies sort of trade up and down on the perception of regulatory.\n\n00:23:52,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n Flexibility and maybe there's— you know— we're all guessing, right? But maybe there's an argument that, you know, this FDA could be even more libertarian for those types of companies.","char_start":19640,"char_end":23467,"start_time":"00:20:25","end_time":null}

But maybe there's an argument that, you know, this FDA could be even more libertarian for those types of companies.\n\n00:24:01,920 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, and like we did see in Dr. Macri's opening, you know, the way it was covered, his opening remarks internally at the FDA talk about things like cell and gene therapy. And so. I mean, I guess it all. Like these thoughts are maybe a little bit more stock-specific than, again, society-specific, right? Because the lack of independence for the FDA is— not good, but as it relates to the sector, I don't know. I feel like I actually feel like there's more of a polarized view out there, at least from my conversations with investors, where some people are very, very worried. They're very worried about delays, and all kinds of unpredictability and stuff. Whereas there's others who think. You know, maybe certain stocks here are on sale because of perceived regulatory uncertainty. Around a previously agreed upon flexible path. But, you know, if it's in if it's for X or Y severe rare disease.\n\n00:24:47,310 [SPEAKER_4]\n Is it really that likely that that path will change? And to be honest, for certain stocks, I'm. I'm maybe more agreeing with that view too.\n\n00:24:55,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I'll just, you know, So we have a unique kind of venture model. We play a pretty active role in a number of our investments. I mean, literally, I'm on weekly meetings with a lot of management teams and we also rely on a lot of advisors, consultants, who work with other biotech companies. I'd probably put myself more in the optimistic category of what's happening at the FDA. Again, no one likes to see discontinuity. No one likes to see uncertainty. But I can tell you, I mean, there's a lot of data points we have. Where we've been very, very frustrated with FDA guidance.\n\n00:25:33,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n the uh, inability to just move forward with programs, you know, overweighting, you know, animal talks data to, you know, over, you know, healthy volunteer. Dose exposures. This is not unique to one division. It's across divisions.\n\n00:25:51,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bruce was here a couple of weeks ago, I think, talking about that the majority of their companies that go outside of the U. S. More and more companies are saying, 'Should we get clinical data outside of the U. S.?' So this predates all of these changes. And if you really look at some of the changes in the FDA. I mean, a lot of changes were made going back the last five years. I mean, a lot of hierarchy changes, a lot of changes at the division level. And so yeah, I mean this is very disruptive and I think we've got more uncertainty. Bye. I mean, I'll just say this, you know, even though it was a small communication around phasing out animal testing, relying on other means. Including a statement about using clinical data. You know, to allow for easier paths in the clinic in the US. You know, I think for me, this is a good sign and signal. That that there may be more pragmatism applied.\n\n00:26:53,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n To doing the right clinical programs and not handicapping a lot of biotechs, because we're facing this with multiple companies across our portfolio, and we're hearing others. So I again, it's only one data point on this animal testing about antibodies and organoids and like, you know, who knows when this will be fully implemented. But if it's a signal of intent.\n\n00:27:16,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it's a good development and a good sign. And I kind of wish we could all, you know, you know, you know, go to sleep for six months and wake up and just figure out where's the market? What are the guidances that we've seen? Right. You know, who's in place? at the divisions.\n\n00:27:35,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I think Jeroen said it. Last week, I believe. That there were some documented changes at the division level, and that's the most concerning. For discontinuity, but some divisions have remained intact.\n\n00:27:48,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n Again, I— I'm less the sky is falling and more. Let's wait and see, and let's see what purposeful communications are coming out. Tess, what are your thoughts? I mean, you guys have a big portfolio, bigger than ours. In this FDA communication on animal testing. What's your interpretive lens on that?","char_start":23167,"char_end":27625,"start_time":"00:23:52","end_time":null}

In this FDA communication on animal testing. What's your interpretive lens on that?\n\n00:28:09,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, I think it's really encouraging. It's actually an area where some of our venture partners and some of our companies have had discussions with the FDA about this before. And I think we're a bit hamstrung by the classic. You know, feedback of. Well, bring us the package and we'll let you know if it's okay.\n\n00:28:32,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I think the FDA has historically expressed openness and some flexibility on animal testing requirements, but without really specific guidance about what is required. In the absence of that guidance, what are you going to do? Right, you're going to do what you think gives you the highest probability of being able to move forward. Which typically means that you're going to do the work that, you know, biotech companies have uh you know been doing for uh you know for a long time. So I think it's encouraging that they're going to think through it. As you say, I think it's very practical. That they're considering this guidance. You know, for the point on the FDA. More broadly. I share some of the concerns about independence, hopefully now with Dr. McCary in his seat. Having a strong medical background, he's really going to be approaching issues from a scientific and data-oriented perspective.\n\n00:29:30,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n But I think the people, some of the people cuts, I think are concerning.\n\n00:29:38,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n And, you know, your point about waking up in six months sounds wonderful because, you know, I think that could, you know, that could resolve quite well. I mean, there's a real opportunity here to. know, bring in great talent. you know, try and modernize, you know, bring out guidance in. In areas where perhaps the development path could be more efficient. So I think there's a real opportunity, but that opportunity needs.\n\n00:30:08,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n strong, you know, strong.\n\n00:30:10,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n a talented place to manage it and experience people. So we actually wrote. You know, Peter.\n\n00:30:18,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n Peter Kolchinski from RE Capital and Peter Rubin of No Patient Left Behind. you know, wrote a letter to Senator Cassidy, who's, you know, as the, you know, is in charge of the Senate Health Committee. and plays a key role in oversight of HHS to make sure that they're really living by their you know, commitments. And I think we've been disappointed with how that's played out from a vaccine standpoint, since that was a key part of why Cassidy ended up voting for. You know, voting yes for RFK, we're hopeful that, you know, those discussions between Cassidy and RFK are, you know, more productive in future. But we wrote a letter to him really with a few making the point that there's some key employees who have been let go, I think, before. You know, Dr. McCary was even in place. And some of those employees are key to assessing, you know, assessing programs, negotiating the PDUFA program, managing, supporting reviews, right?\n\n00:31:29,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n I know there was press about, well, people who are doing reviews, aren't going to be let go, but those people who are doing reviews, they rely on you know, pretty critical roles in other departments that, you know, maybe weren't directly working on reviews.\n\n00:31:46,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n So.\n\n00:31:48,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think those are all things that we really need to watch. The PDUFA one was a little more concerning perhaps because there was also some concern. I think Pink Sheets came out with an article. saying that there were these concerns about defunding of PDUFA, because, essentially, you need the budget to put forward. enough budget such that the PDUFA funding is never going to be more than 50% of total agency funding. Otherwise, there's concerns about regulatory capture and other things. And so there's this trigger, that's kind of a trigger that you need to hit in order to receive PDUFA funding. And Pinkshi shared some, I guess they had a source that suggested that we should be concerned about. You know, sub-trigger funding that, like, my gosh, is Congress going to only authorize an amount? That would essentially mean.","char_start":27325,"char_end":31754,"start_time":"00:28:09","end_time":null}

That would essentially mean.\n\n00:32:51,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that would be very concerning. And so having also the employees who were responsible for negotiating the user fee program.\n\n00:33:00,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, those are. key employees that should probably you know that should probably come back since that's a critical function of the FDA. So I think we'll have to watch from a people standpoint very closely. to see who gets put in place, make sure that they're experienced individuals who can help keep. reviews on track, keep earlier stage feedback on track. And we'll be watching that very closely and hopeful that Dr. McCary is going to be. going to be bringing some of those folks back or at least bringing experienced new people in.\n\n00:33:33,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, that's great. And Peter did a great job of just clarifying this whole concern about the user fee. He posted and got a lot of pickup on that. So I'm pleased that he clarified that for our industry colleagues. Um, uh, and the the biggest concern for me was the project managers. They often serve as the true liaison informally with sponsors. So, the rumors that project managers might have been part of the cuts—those are a real glue for sponsors to get clarification in between guidance meetings or even when there are minutes for clarification from a reviewer. And so, I think that would, you know, I don't think they're getting rid of the role. The question is, are they going to maintain a good liaison role through project management with sponsors? That would be something to watch.\n\n00:34:27,350 [SPEAKER_4]\n Can I, Chris, can I just pose a question to people and it'd be interesting to hear? You know, Eric and Tess, what you guys have heard. What have people been hearing from their companies about the FDA, because, you know, I mean, I only have a small sample size, right? We're talking about a couple of weeks of. Know big changes at the FDA, but so far the companies I've talked to have said that Their interactions have been normal. Their interactions have been timely. You know, maybe I haven't talked to a company where they're like. counterpart has completely changed. It's just been interesting, right? And we talked about this last week. Denali filed for excluded approval for Hunter syndrome.\n\n00:35:01,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n interacted with their counterparts at Cedar the day before that submission and the week before. Has anyone heard anything different yet?\n\n00:35:09,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n I definitely have. Yes. And I think, Paul, you know, I think there may be a little bit of selection bias in the feedback that you're getting about interactions with the FDA, perhaps. Um, but the things that we have heard, nothing that's really uh you know, terrible. But what we have heard are things like, oh, the senior reviewers aren't there anymore, right? We just have junior reviewers who are looking at this. And we got a bunch of feedback that was very conflicting. From the junior reviewers, right? Normally you'd be able to escalate this and you'd have someone who you could talk to. But now we don't actually have the right people with experience to escalate that either. Um, so that was an example, right? Um, you know, we've talked about other companies where leadership failed to attend meetings, right? And so these meetings, like, you prep for these FDA meetings forever. With the hope that, like, if anything is misinterpreted or not well understood in that meeting, you have leadership there to help resolve issues quickly.

So. I don't think that we're getting to a level where it's like, 'Oh my gosh, my whole review team turned over and now I can't proceed with this file.'

But we've also had a situation we know of. private company that didn't even have a pre-IND meeting and the FDA refused.\n\n00:37:15,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n The pre-IND meeting request and said, 'We'll review it with the IND.' There's always been this perception that the FDA can feel stretched at times and they're overworked and over busy. So now, with staff cuts, I think they are prioritizing. What? is worthy of granting. a meeting how much attention they're going to put on certain companies. Again, I talked about the conservatism that we're seeing. where it's definitely influencing us in terms of Hey, should we even bother requesting a meeting with the FDA given the kind of turmoil that's going on? And, you know, we're always thinking of pivoting to UK or Australia or somewhere else. to keep our programs moving. But I'd say that we have this perception that maybe this isn't the time. to request. I mean, we have one program there where it's justified to request a type A meeting. And we're just trying to figure out, should we or shouldn't we? At this very moment. I think there is this feeling that.\n\n00:38:16,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n They're scrambling and they're going to have to prayer. Everybody's got the right intention, I think, at the FDA in trying to. To keep things moving but I just think they're overstretched right now and can't work the way they would in a normal kind of 100% efficiency circumstance.\n\n00:38:34,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, let's maybe pivot to the tariffs. And, you know, that was the news of the week, Eric, as you mentioned. You know, just let's talk about perspectives on that and anything, you know, there was a. Paul, you want to, and Eric, you want to comment on that? And then Tess would love for you to comment on some of the pharma CEOs that are trying to bring manufacturing back as a result. But Paul, you want to start with? What's your perspective on the tariffs and taxes?\n\n00:39:01,640 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, sure. I feel like my perspective, Chris, is: All the investors that I talk to don't really know how to invest. Within this issue. I mean, we can look at— You know, we can talk to companies about their supply chain and you know, where Drugs are made where patents are domiciled. You know, there's obvious standouts, right? Oh, IP is domiciled in Ireland. We can try to do model exercises with different ways that tariffs could be calculated. I mean, I think it's really tricky. I mean, I feel like the tariff conversation. In mind, going back to what Eric was saying earlier, it feels to me it's almost like more about market volatility and just the fact that biotech is a super high beta sector. If the market swings, it's going to swing a lot in either direction. And I think people are having more trouble investing around that aspect of it, but as it relates to like the fundamentals, I mean—you know, we all know it's bad, right? But beyond how to model that, I think it's tricky. I think it's also tricky, right? Because you're going to talk about companies bringing back manufacturing.","char_start":34975,"char_end":39337,"start_time":"00:36:11","end_time":null}

You know, whether these are really going to go into place and be around for four or five years, or if it's going to be chatter for the next two months. And so I mean, I think, to me, I feel like the top line is just more uncertainty, more volatility.\n\n00:40:22,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n And as an investor, how do you play defense around it?\n\n00:40:27,190 [SPEAKER_4]\n Do you like anything to add to that?\n\n00:40:28,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'd agree 100% with Paul. I mean, you know, the session we just had on the FDA is our industry's front and center. If the FDA doesn't get its act together and isn't able to function, you know, we're in biotech. Especially smaller, innovative companies, we're dead in the water, right? When it comes to tariffs, number one, they only pertain to the commercial stage companies, the much larger biopharmaceutical companies, as opposed to the innovators. And number two, they pertain a lot less to the biopharmaceutical industry than they do to other industries that have much higher cost of manufacture and do much more manufacturing overseas.\n\n00:41:08,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n On a relative basis, you might think that high tariffs might benefit the biopharmaceutical industry in terms of having less negative impact on us. Than on almost any other sector that I can imagine. That said, Paul's right. I think some of the larger companies are thinking about their manufacturing infrastructure.\n\n00:41:29,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n What I'm hearing is they're much more likely to wait it out the next three or four years, not knowing what might happen after the Trump administration. And of course, it would take at least three or four years to bring your manufacturing from one geography to another. So I don't think that's likely. I think a lot of them are looking closely at their tax accounting in particular. and also looking at their manufacturing accounting and trying to maximize the math between those two equations. um, either shifting IP to different geographies and or reducing or increasing the cost of manufacturing associated with different geographies. such that they can have lesser P &L exposure from whatever may. come with regard to tariffs, of course, we don't even know what we're solving for yet because the Trump administration hasn't been clear on that front.\n\n00:42:18,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. Hey, Brad, I did listen to the Bezod interview that Matt Klein did. There was a good, nuanced discussion around pricing and what it means, where the US has largely been, you know, the high-margin group, and that there could be some positive implications for. You know, again, the worst scenario is that, you know, most favored nation goes to the lowest price, but there's also scenarios where this could be beneficial. And I wonder if that, you know, is the pharma companies that we're seeing. And Tess, after Brad, I want you to comment, you know, that they're saying, 'Hey, we'll work with you. We'll get, bring manufacturing.\n\n00:42:54,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, Lilly, J &J, Novartis kind of leaning into this.' Maybe they view it as negotiating leverage to, you know, protect the pricing power to some degree. But Brad, any comments on that? And then Tess would love to hear from you.\n\n00:43:09,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, at the risk of having an unpopular opinion, I have to say I personally support the pharma tariffs. Number one, I think there is a real national security angle to this issue and I don't think i think it's going to Like it's not going to be a carrot, but a stick that's going to solve that problem and get companies to move back here. And you're seeing that immediately. I mean, we saw it with Novartis yesterday. I think the number was like 25 billion or something.\n\n00:43:41,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n The reality is we have.\n\n00:43:44,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n We, meaning the United States or the White House, however you look at it, has the ultimate card to play here because we are the market for this industry, like. There's not even like anything that's in second place. Like everything else is a distant third or fourth. So we have the ultimate.","char_start":39037,"char_end":43529,"start_time":"00:40:02","end_time":null}

And the reality is there are so many places around the world like Ireland and other places throughout Europe and Asia. Who make small fortunes by enticing companies to manufacture and do business there and to domicile themselves there and to domicile their IP there and then those same countries don't pay pay a small fraction or don't pay at all for the drugs that our industry creates. So I think that our industry has had this coming for a long time. I think, like I said in the beginning, the abruptness of it is, I think, you know uh chaotic and um and you know maybe there's a way to do it more smoothly or something. But I think, from an overall macro perspective, I agree 100 in principle with you, you know, bringing more of this to the United States because we are the hundred pound gorilla in terms of the market.\n\n00:45:11,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n Of why you know what supports this industry. Yep, good comments. Tess?\n\n00:45:18,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thank you, Chris. I mean, first, I would absolutely agree with Brad from just a national security angle in terms of having, you know, more production in the United States. I think an area that doesn't get, you know, nearly enough uh you know press on this is the generics industry. Right, where, you know, I think there's been a lot of shortages over time. Some of that comes from, you know, you know, just, you know, so much price pressure and so much, you know, ex-U. S. you know, ex-US manufacturing, that any kind of, you know, supply chain snafu, can really create shortages and can result in a real detriment to patients. So I think that's an area that I think is really important.\n\n00:46:06,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tariffs are probably, you know, not necessarily the way the administration should go in terms of bringing manufacturing back to the generic sector, simply because the margins are so slim. Right? And so I think that maybe there should be a bit of a different approach between. Know branded pharmaceuticals and uh, generic, uh, you know, generic manufacturers and I would put the you know, generic manufacturing as the area where I think there's probably the most acute. You know, security concern and domestic supply concern. So.\n\n00:46:46,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's kind of point number one. I think, too, on these manufacturing announcements. You know, look, I think it's a smart, intelligent way to curry favor. Whether they actually happen is going to be another question. I think Novartis, Lilly, J &J, as you mentioned, they have all come out and announced these multibillion-dollar investments in the U. S. I don't know if anyone remembers the 'you know'— first Trump administration. I think this happened often, but there's one that I remember in particular, which was Apple. Which promised, it was like, we're going to build these three big plants. And we are going to invest a billion dollars in this fund for advanced manufacturing. It sounds like really nice and it creates these like nice headlines and then, you know, I don't, I'm sure like Apple built a bunch of plans, but like, were they just going to do that anyways? And like. you know they're press releasing it. And like, I don't know if the fund ever happened. And, right. So, you know, I think there's, you know, there's an aspect here of like, what is PR?","char_start":43229,"char_end":46888,"start_time":"00:44:04","end_time":null}

So, you know, I think there's, you know, there's an aspect here of like, what is PR?\n\n00:47:47,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n And like, what is real? And what are you actually going to do? You know, to this point of manufacturing and like tax being wrapped up in this, it's like well you can move your manufacturing, but like, are you still going to have these issues? Because like your IP is like over. you know, in another country. And that is really an artifact of a time when the corporate tax rate in the US was like, 35%. You know, it's not anymore. It's 21%. How do you unwind that? It is incredibly expensive and difficult to unwind all of this IP stuff that's really from another point in time. So, you know, I think, well, uh, I haven't yet seen any, you know, solutions or thoughts on how that can, you know, how that can happen, certainly moving manufacturing over the U. S. would help with. Your value add that you can do in the U. S. and move some of those profits away from, you know, Ireland or Switzerland, but it doesn't solve the whole problem.\n\n00:48:45,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, yeah, this is another one we got to look at, take a long-term view and see how it plays out over the next six to 12 months and ultimate years to see how this evolves. But so let's move to the data readouts. And I'm going to ask my co-host to be, you know, a quick top line on this. We'll do it rapid fire. But there was some data, Paul, if you want to cover. Lexio and Rhythm, and then Tess, I know AAN, there's some CNS data that's come out this week as well.\n\n00:49:15,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, sure. Thanks. So on Rhythm, they had positive phase three data for their drug set melanotide and hypothalamic obesity. I think, you know, just the interesting point of discussion for this. Podcast is that for any companies listening, I mean, this was sort of a management team masterclass in setting expectations. I mean, they were very firm for a long time. They didn't wait until the last minute around a certain effect size hurdle. That was conservative.\n\n00:49:40,640 [SPEAKER_4]\n To the point that I think, you know, they really did have investor expectations pricing in a meaningful regression from phase two to phase three. Then they beat that hurdle and you know, in one of the worst markets I can remember, their stock has significantly outperformed and was up a lot in a couple of bad market days. And so, from a drug perspective, it's an important drug because this is a really challenging population. I mean, most of these diagnosed patients had brain cancer and tissue damage to the hypothalamus. And as a result, they don't respond to GLP-1s. You know, the data really helped, I think, embolden that with you know, the placebo arm having a bunch of GLP-1 patients and yet placebo still gaining weight over a year. And so. Interesting company, super interesting product. And I think, as we talk about the types of stocks that investors are more interested in this market, having a de-risked asset is a nice place to be. As it relates to gene therapy, and I would love to hear Tess and Eric. Any quick comments or, you know, you too, Chris. Of course, but just as it relates to like. How public market investors are looking at gene therapy companies right now, because, you know, Lexia put out some data where, from my perspective, and.\n\n00:50:42,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, I cover the stock. Maybe I'm biased, but there weren't really any. Sort of surprises right. I mean they're developing a gene therapy for phrygiositaxia. Um, you know, the biomarkers in this indication have noise. Right, they measure for taxon protein. This gene therapy does not make a lot of it, but the argument is you only need a little for benefit. Uh, there's dose dependency, but there's noise. Right, there's variable baselines, and then they also look at left ventricular mass, which is a validated biomarker. And if you believe their agreement with the FDA going to be their endpoint in their pivotal study. Although I think a lot of this FDA guidance is getting discounted by people right now because of uncertainty at the FDA.","char_start":46588,"char_end":50904,"start_time":"00:47:47","end_time":null}

Although I think a lot of this FDA guidance is getting discounted by people right now because of uncertainty at the FDA.\n\n00:51:18,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n But the LVMI data look good, right? I mean, again, the caveat is the baselines are very variable. Not all patients with FA actually have elevated LDMI. We saw a stock up there where the stock traded down 25 to 30%. It was sort of hard to explain. It more seemed to me like it was— a selling on a liquidity event versus anything you know, newly wrong with the data, but I also think, with gene therapy right now, outside of the perceived uncertainty at the FDA level, I think there's been more of an investor reckoning and a little bit of a shoot first, ask questions later across the gene therapy space, just as it relates to what is the commercial model. Are any of these companies viable takeout targets? you know, do they have to build a business themselves? And what is a business with no long-term terminal value look like unless you really are recreating products? And so that's not a Lexio-specific comment, but, you know, I feel like. There's just a lot of overhangs in that space now. And I think the surreptive DMD gene therapy. Having the setback it did, you know, has had a negative read-through into the space if anyone wants to add anything there.\n\n00:52:21,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think the only indelible call is, you know, I too thought the data were certainly favorable. I don't cover the stock like you do, but. To Tess's point earlier, it's an event, it's a milestone, it's a trigger, and there's no such thing as good triggers in today's market. It's bad and worse, right? So it's just a time period. Companies are very much at risk if they say anything.\n\n00:52:44,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I'll just say, I mean, you know, we were investors in cargo that was a cell therapy. And I think broadly, cell and gene therapy, even broadly genetic technologies, if you look at Intelia's know valuation, I think there still is a big overhang there. I think Disrupta, Uh, Data had something to do with it. I think Peter Marks, I mean, all of it is just, it's a tough area and it'll be. I think everybody wants to see it swing back first before they feel it's safer to jump back in the water. And I do agree with you, Paul, the liquidity event in this environment. Where funds need to sell, you know, uh, it might have been a factor as well.\n\n00:53:23,259 [SPEAKER_0]\n Tess, any comments on that, or do you want to touch on some of the other data from this week?\n\n00:53:27,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, maybe we can touch on some of the other data, maybe just quick hits from ADPD and AAN, and please, others, jump in for anything else that stood out. You know, I think, you know, ADPD, we got an update from Alveon. They had their Apollo 4 Phase 3 that they presented.\n\n00:53:48,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n And this was an RCT of their drug that's an oral. um, beta amyloid oligomer inhibitor. And they were looking at APOE for homozygous, so people who have both mutations.\n\n00:54:05,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I think they saw overall that the results were not statistically significant. Um, But, you know, I think there was, you know, of course, and I always want to get Eric's view on this. There was a subgroup. There was a subgroup, Eric. Um, that had uh you know that was that that was the MCI that was the MCI, the mild cognitive impairment group. So they were looking at a patient population that included both MCI and mild. And so I think the question that they're going to have is. Um, you know, I think there's uh, you know, they they certainly have some ideas for why that is illogical that you would see that effect in MCI and I think the question is going to be: Is there enough of a rationale there to move forward in? A smaller group of patients. We know that going earlier in Alzheimer's is important, but are the results robust enough? They did see a separation in CDR sum of boxes in that pre-specified subgroup, I think it wasn't statistically significant.\n\n00:55:08,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n On CDR summer boxes, which is typically your registrational endpoint.\n\n00:55:12,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n More to come, I'm sure, in terms of where that could go.","char_start":50604,"char_end":54970,"start_time":"00:51:18","end_time":null}

You know, brain shuttle.\n\n00:55:26,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n A drug that Roche is developing for Alzheimer's. And I think that data continues to be. Continues to look pretty interesting in terms of the first kind of brain shuttle. I think most important there. Um, is that they? You know, they had an additional number of patients. If you recall, there was a cerebral hemorrhage case that happened.\n\n00:55:54,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think at CTAD they disclosed that. And since tightened the criteria for enrollment, and as a result, didn't see any more of those, which was positive.\n\n00:56:12,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the thesis for, you know, Tromtenumab is really that it can get to faster plaque clearance. Um and uh, with lower ARIA, and there's a few different types of ARIA, but one that we often look at because it tends to be more related to symptoms is 'Are you at ease?' And at one of the dose groups, I think the 3. 6 dose group, which is the high dose group that they had. There continue to be no cases of ARIA, which is really encouraging. That's one of the reasons that the um currently commercially available beta amyloid drugs have seen less uptake than maybe one would have expected is because of these rates of ARIA that require a lot of monitoring and can also result in pretty serious symptoms for a smaller subset of patients.\n\n00:57:03,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n So those were some of the updates. Maybe just quickly at AAN, I think one that stood out to us was. Looking at Uplizna, which is a CD19 antibody. That Amgen is developing in Myasthenia gravis. And I think everyone was pretty disappointed in the data that came out last year. Where they were looking at MGADL scores of about 1. 8, placebo-adjusted, which was not viewed as particularly competitive versus Vivgard. They came out with longer follow-up. And that score continues to improve. And so at 52-week, it got to-2. 8. And so I think that's kind of showing up as a drug that we really need to watch in that space and certainly more competitive than the first data release.\n\n00:58:00,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great. Tess and Paul, great job covering a lot of data in a short amount of time. There's two things I wanted to highlight from folks who are frequent guests. Well, Daphne, who uh uh leads this biotech hangout, was nominated for the status list that Stat News puts out. So. It's kind of like who are the the major players to watch. Uh, I have to say I was impressed that Stat you know I I I feel like the other side, if you will, um dismisses any uh journalism of biotech, but I was surprised to see Stat highlighted McCary Baracharia RFK Jr., Mehmet Oz, along with folks like Scott Gottlieb and others. And so it showed me that, hey, they do want to cover the current administration and what they're saying. Hopefully, to be objective, because I think we need to keep the dialogue open on both sides. To have credibility, rather than have the other side just tune out, and go to alternative media or Twitter or independent journalism.\n\n00:59:07,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n So that was nice to see, but congrats to Daphne on that. And also. There was a post by Michal Preminger, who's departing, a very significant role she's played at J &J, leading external innovation there. And she's probably one of the more prolific folks out there as a champion of our industry. I don't know what she has planned next, but. We all, you know, are endeared by Michal and how much he contributes on this. Biotech Hangout and just for the industry at large. So we're at the hour. Brad, I'll come to you. Any final?\n\n00:59:42,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Comments either on Michal or Daphne or overall, you know, for going into next week.\n\n00:59:49,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, of course, you know, best to me all.\n\n00:59:53,349 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, mijo!

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:26,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n We're going to start by talking about the macro and current biotech market environment. Biotech stocks have been up. In the last week. Except for today, a little bit. Since bottoming on April 7th, the XBI is up about 15%, and the BBC, which tracks small and mid-cap biotech stocks, is up 30%. Though these indices are still down around 12% and 24% for the year, respectively.\n\n00:00:50,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n The recent rally has been attributed in great part to the recent comments from our new FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. But the sector has underperformed for years, and the last few months have been very tough. I was pleasantly surprised to see that even Adam Feuerstein, who has been writing about the gloom in the sector, wrote a positive piece called 'Sunshine Days' yesterday where he quoted Tim. We haven't seen much M&A, but we did get another takeover rumor yesterday. Merkei GAA to acquire Springworks in a $3. 5 billion deal. That is a slight premium, but well below what they were trading at in February. So let's kick it off with Tim and then go around. Tim, what do you think? Do you see some green shoots for biotech?\n\n00:01:37,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n You're on mute.\n\n00:01:43,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, while he's getting off of mute, maybe Josh, do you want to start it off?\n\n00:01:48,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure. I mean, it's hard to call them green shoots when the XBI is struggling to get back to its highs from earlier this year, highs from last year, highs from five years ago.\n\n00:02:01,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think we are a sector that's consistently optimistic about the future and the hope for the future, and proud of all the innovation that is occurring in the sector.\n\n00:02:12,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n But on the other hand, there are powerful forces that are acting to constrain spending on biopharmaceuticals, which in turn act to constrain investor interest in the sector.\n\n00:02:28,090 [SPEAKER_1]\n I guess the shoots are less brown than they've been lately, but again, it's hard to be overly. Uh, optimistic. Um, in the context of an XBI that's been so sluggish for so long, the XBI being very good gauge of generalist interest, and the fact that generalists just don't find this space appealing, that's a topic I think we may get to a little later.\n\n00:02:54,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you, Tiffany.\n\n00:02:55,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n Can you hear me now?\n\n00:02:57,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, you have a little bit of background noise. We'll try to ignore it. Go ahead.\n\n00:03:01,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, sorry about that.\n\n00:03:04,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think things are never quite as bad as they seem and maybe never as good as they seem when times are good. And so, look, the bottom line is we've got plenty of fundamental innovation going on, but we've It had a backdrop.\n\n00:03:18,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh. Hi, President, who has been unpredictable and creating a lot of uncertainty.\n\n00:03:24,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n An FDA that's gone through some cuts at a time when we're facing competition from China, so you know, not surprisingly, the XBI's down. The number of people in the sector hasn't been a number of hedge funds have been under a lot of pressure, right? So you're seeing some pressure selling at the same time that all of this other stuff is going on.\n\n00:03:46,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n The reality is that the FDA, I don't think, is going to be nearly as bad as we think. And in fact, I personally think the FDA is going to be a positive. tailwind for the sector. We saw very good inflation report. Our president is clearly playing a game of poker with tariffs and doesn't actually intend to impose these insane tariffs. And so I think in the last week, things have just And that's why the XBI is up. And it doesn't mean that, you know, everything is great and sunny. I agree with you, Josh. But I do think that we're seeing very positive signs from last week.","char_start":0,"char_end":4341,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I mean, you saw, you know, biotech trading well. Inately is risk on, but you can even see, you know, a lot of the microcap names we've got some that are up 40–50, you know, names with early stage technologies and very little data, and names that are more levered to a more lenient FDA. And just in my investor conversations, I felt like. For the past month, there was just a very, very high concentration of interest in like five or six stocks that I cover that are all known de-risk asset names or commercial or companies that clearly have no financing overhang. It feels like the interest is broadening a bit. Now, granted, this is with specialists. I'm not saying generalists are trying to buy the next gene therapy story. Um, as much pain as some specialist funds have been in, I do feel like there's less defense on the investing side and maybe a little bit more offense right now.\n\n00:05:31,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you. So I'm going to summarize the McCary interview and then I'm going to ask John to comment. So I watched the McCary interview on Megyn Kelly Sunday morning. That was what I did on my Sunday morning. And I thought there were some important positives, including a commitment to expediting the drug approval process. He questioned why it currently takes 10 years to bring a drug to market in the U. S. and expressed urgency to shorten the timelines due to patient needs. McCary also gave a few examples of what they plan to do, including, I think this is the part that was probably viewed as very bullish, requiring only one randomized controlled trial, and then following that with intense post-marketing surveillance based on EHR data. He made the distinction of calling out VAERS and FAERS as being unreliable due to being based on self-reporting and talked about EHR data and the ability to mine that. Better. He also acknowledged that there's privacy issues which they're going to address. With regard to rare conditions, he noted the potential for conditional approval based on a plausible mechanism, even without a randomized study.\n\n00:06:37,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n They would then be monitoring after based on health record data. He also talked about reducing animal testing requirements by using technologies like organ-on-a-chip predictive in vitro modeling and AI in the review process. The FDA, under McCary's leadership, recently announced a plan to phase out animal testing requirements for monoclonal antibody therapies and other drugs. He noted they plan to improve on bureaucracy by reducing red tape and eliminating internal silos and fiefdoms. And there were also a few areas to keep an eye on. He said he wants American Pharma to do well, but scientific analysis should be independent, and said that they're going to be replacing pharma representatives with patient family representatives. On advisory committees, I'm not sure how big of a change that will actually be.\n\n00:07:22,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then he spent a lot of time talking about areas that are less relevant to us, like food and environment, and their plans to eliminate ingredients.\n\n00:07:29,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n For example, banning food dyes, which we just heard about, and then microplastics and seed oils and the microbiome he talked a lot about. And reducing the overall administration. And he claimed that no cuts were made to reviewers, scientists, or inspectors, and that cuts were made only to communications staff, FDA lobbyists, and outdated IT staff. But that doesn't necessarily gel with what we've been hearing from some biotech CEOs. I have to say that my own personal end of one experience is that the groups we've been interacting with are functioning well and meeting timelines. But this has not necessarily been the case for other CEOs in biotech. John, you've talked to some of the CEOs that have had issues following the recent changes at FDA. Can you comment on that and also the very well-researched article in BioCentury this week?","char_start":4043,"char_end":8470,"start_time":"00:04:29","end_time":null}

Can you comment on that and also the very well-researched article in BioCentury this week?\n\n00:08:15,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, look, I also found the Macri interview to be encouraging, net, net, net. You know, Megyn Kelly made me cringe. But what Macri said was, I think, you know, encouraging. And, you know, there were really good words that he used, you know, want pharma to succeed. The innovation word which is always great to hear from from policy makers—um, you know— to some extent, he sounded a lot like Peter Marx, and some of the things he was saying, which is, which I think is good, but obviously, it's encouraging. Obviously, we need to see that, whatever this rebuild and all these new provisions are put together. It's going to be super important that they maintain scientific standards and independence from political influence. And I think that's going to be something to watch for. But, you know, to your point. You know, I am involved with a lot of companies and I see a lot of different things. It's a bit of a tale of two cities, I would say, across my universe.\n\n00:09:15,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n Some companies that are experiencing delays are, in contrast, others are even experiencing accelerated responses. I had one friend of a company running a company that submitted a protocol amendment and received a response within 24 hours, which is amazing. So, you know, it's a bit all over the place right now. You know, there was a very interesting issue regarding the Vanda CRL appeal that happened where The FDA themselves said that the nature of the appeal delay was related to staffing and the recent reorg and recent disruption. So it's obviously indisputable that the FDA acknowledged that point. So I think we have to take note of that as well.\n\n00:10:04,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, yeah, that's my general response on the ecosystem. And, you know, the point on the Steve Woosden article that came out this past Tuesday really focused on this. This plan reorg of the FDA, which, you know, it was a very well-researched article, as is often the case by Steve Usdin, that talked about some of these structural changes that are being proposed, you know, and talked to. Former leadership like Janet Woodcock and Rachel Sherman. And I think the key message out of that was the important need for really thoughtful considerations around some of these changes and also change management as to how these changes are done.\n\n00:10:44,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n Hopefully, the commissioner will take note of these in terms of the actions that he takes on.\n\n00:10:50,630 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. And another area which has been a little bit of a headwind is the threat of pharma tariffs, which remains uncertain. We heard some announcements from big pharma companies about expanded investments in U. S. manufacturing sites, and the topic of tariffs came up in adjusted earnings and revenue predictions during recent earnings presentations.\n\n00:11:13,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n Industry lobbying groups, some of which you and I, John, are involved with, are advocating for other non-tariff incentives on shoring manufacturing. So we'll see how it all plays out. I'll open it up to the group to comment on what you're hearing about the impact of tariffs. Let's maybe start with Tim and then the rest of the group can comment.\n\n00:11:33,640 [SPEAKER_2]\n Look, I think— Pharma tariffs in theory could be a pretty rough thing. And I think it's very much atmospherics that we're watching. In other words, Trump is using the threat of pharma tariffs. To encourage on-shoring is also very focused on pricing differentials. You know, the same drug sells for one price in the U. S., sells for another price in Germany. He would like to see that narrowed, and I think you're going to see some on-shoring take place.\n\n00:12:02,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n And you're also going to see actions take place on prices. And I fear that it's going to be bad for drug access in countries that are not as wealthy as the United States, because pharma companies are going to be raising prices in other countries, from what I'm hearing from my friends at March Pharma.\n\n00:12:20,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n I did want to comment a little bit on. What John, you said on the FDA.","char_start":8170,"char_end":12592,"start_time":"00:08:15","end_time":null}

What John, you said on the FDA.\n\n00:12:27,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n This is the big driver of stock prices. Right now. Biotech just took off. This week, and it was driven, I think, very much by the comments. And I specifically was on a panel yesterday with Naomi Lowy, who was recently an Associate Director of Cedar, and so she spoke extensively of what's going on. It sounds like she has many contacts still inside, and her comments, I think, were incredibly relevant to the Austin article. Very much at variance with the message in the Biocentury article. So just to summarize some of the things she said, she said, first of all, The reason that 25% of FDA reviewers essentially recuse themselves from reviewing things, which is obviously what's behind these companies that are experiencing delays, is because they were told that they needed to be in the office five days a week. She said, at the very moment this happened, all of these. Kind of. Doge people started showing up at the FDA who obviously had no knowledge or qualifications of actually looking at this as an organization.\n\n00:13:34,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n And she said, 'Oh, and by the way, you know.' The FDA has 2,000 reviewers who are physicians. They chose not to be physicians instead of working with a regulatory agency for the public good. In general, it's not like these were the washout positions. And so she said it was very offensive. And so people just said, 'You know what, I'm going to.' Look for another job. She said in her own case.\n\n00:13:57,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n She was required each week to send in a list of the five things she accomplished that week. So in her last week of the job, her fifth thing was, 'I found another job.'\n\n00:14:07,619 [SPEAKER_2]\n accomplishments for the week. And so she said, right. So she said, 'Those guys are all gone.' Right.\n\n00:14:19,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Macari is there. Macari is a reasonable guy. working with the leadership teams.\n\n00:14:25,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n And people are coming back to work. The first thing Bakari said is, 'You don't actually have to be in the office five days a week. You can come in. three days a week, but please don't. It'll make it.\n\n00:14:38,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Monday and Friday. In other words, don't give yourself a four-day weekend. Thank you. Arms.'\n\n00:14:45,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n And so morale is changing very, very rapidly at the FDA. And there's some very big changes coming, which were hinted at in Macari's interview. You know, we're under some confidentiality obligations, but just.\n\n00:14:57,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n to say just what down the country next two or three weeks and we're going to start to see companies um that are going to be getting approvals with relatively small data sets as long as those data sets are decisive in involved rare disease situations. So it's going to be a very interesting high. for the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\n00:15:22,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very bullish. on what's happening at the FDA.\n\n00:15:27,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. And one other positive thing that I forgot to mention was the recent executive order, which addressed the pill penalty. And I think that was viewed as positive because there's a belief that it might address the nine versus 13 years. So the nine years for small molecules in the IRA. Anybody else like to comment on?\n\n00:15:48,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n tariffs, FDA, or anything like that before we move to some data.","char_start":12292,"char_end":15947,"start_time":"00:12:20","end_time":null}

It's great to hear that. And, you know, as we all know, you know, journalists are fantastic at what they do. They're important as always. But, you know, they also will talk to certain people and maybe get a perspective and it may not be the complete picture, if you will, and that's just natural. I, for one, net-net am feeling positive about the FDA as well. I just want to make sure that the— The net benefits of some of these, you know, forward-leaning policies, as long as they're science-based, will accelerate innovation getting to patients while the potential impact of these changes and staffing and so forth, don't slow that progress down. That's all. And let's see where it goes. I'm net-net optimistic, but I think we have to see how it plays out for the rest of the year.\n\n00:16:48,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great. So we're going to move to some data, but we'll come back to some of these bigger themes, including short selling and tips for CEOs and things like that. Let's start with some data, Paul. You cover a range of neuropsychiatric companies and you had a very good KOL. KOL call this week. Which we listened to, where you talked about a number of them. Can you touch on any notable items from that and also would love your thoughts on the CoBENFI ARISE study results and how much they impact the potential for the drug?\n\n00:17:19,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, sure. I mean, I think the The most interesting thing from this KOL call to me, and it almost kind of requires you to zoom out, is that there is just a lot more optimism that psychedelics and psych are real drugs. You know, some of the KOLs have experience with Spravato from J &J and talk about how that's not fully a psychedelic because it's a safer drug. But if you just zoom out, Spravato is a really challenging product to use. It's an every-other-week antidepressant. There's dissociation, inpatient monitoring. Um, the efficacy of it is okay. It worked in half at studies and yet there's 50,000 people on it. Right. And it's growing.\n\n00:18:03,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n Growing very fast. J &J has made a lot of investments in building out the infrastructure. And so, just as we think about psychedelics as a class, I still think investors are looking at a lot of the companies in this space with real caution and real skepticism. And you know, there's the kind of whole stigma around it, right? But at the end of the day, we had someone from MGH who has a they have a psychedelic center. I mean, the physicians are getting ready to use these drugs and even though there's nuanced differences between them and certain complexities like I just kind of keep coming away from some of these doc calls and thinking, you know, what like investors, because look, the backdrop, Daphne, is a number of these companies in the psychedelic space are not trading that much above cash, maybe two times cash or things like that. And so it just continues to be super interesting to me. Know as it relates to co-benfi, so the context is: You know, Combenfi is off to a nice start. First quarter beat numbers reported by Bristol this week. We had covered Karuna, covered Saravelle. I follow Nurikrin.","char_start":15647,"char_end":19187,"start_time":"00:15:48","end_time":null}

I follow Nurikrin.\n\n00:19:04,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Like our expectation had been that. You know this muscarinic class can be a blockbuster class easily in schizophrenia with upside and other indications. But there was a setback that has, I think, nuanced implications. Where Bristol reported that the adjunctive trial, this is combining Cabenfi with another antipsychotic, failed this week. And when you look at the data, there's a signal. But it's a pretty modest signal, and it's not entirely clear why the study failed. Bristol did an analysis excluding patients on one atypical and a psychotic. And when you look at that, there's a bigger effect size. But in general, the benefit. It's just not that big. You know, when we had covered Corona, our view was that this study could have a pretty significant ROI of positive because this would have been the only drug that has a combination label. In all of the schizophrenia space, right? And being able to have that marketing angle as a novel mechanism could have a lot of power. Conversely, though, I still think— and the physicians corroborated this— I still think that Cobenfi is going to be widely used as a combination product.\n\n00:20:06,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I still think, when push comes to shove, and psychiatrists think through the options that they have for the tougher to treat schizophrenia patients. You know, what other choice do you have, other than to try multiple medications in someone who has failed, you know, two, three, four drugs. And right now, about a third of patients with schizophrenia are on two atypical antipsychotics. Even though those types of drugs have overlapping side effects and overlapping mechanisms of action, the actual biological rationale to combine those drugs for additive efficacy is so so and so. You know, I think for Cobenfi, the headline here looks negative and— and but it is negative, but this isn't like other areas where you've removed an indication expansion option. If you look at, for example, the depression space, I think Axome's combination study was negative. But what you hear from most docs is that they use it more often as a combo therapy than a monotherapy. And so I still feel like the bull case for Cobenfi is intact. And I thought our physician panel this week echoed that.\n\n00:21:09,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and I think they needed to run this trial for several reasons, primarily to establish that Coventry was safe to administer in combination with traditional antipsychotics, since in the real world this is how the drug will be used. In combination before the traditional antipsychotic is tapered off. It was interesting. I was looking back and there was a Jeffries analyst that asked them on the last earning call, why wouldn't the probability of success for this trial be more like a 50-50 coin flip, since these studies are pretty hard to run? And I was also reading a little bit about some of the sales assumptions, I think, which are very much in line with what you're saying. Citi actually removed completely adjunctive schizophrenia from their peak sales assumptions. And that brought the sales estimates to $2. 8 billion from $3. 4 billion. But they noted that Alzheimer's psychosis could bring it back to $5 billion in peak sales.\n\n00:22:09,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n William Blair analysts estimate peak sales of about $3. 7 billion without the Alzheimer's upside potential. But anyway, it was, I think, in many ways a disappointing result, but not entirely unexpected. And it sounds like it's being viewed as incremental.\n\n00:22:25,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, you've also been following the Unicure breakthrough therapy designation announcement.

Do you want to talk about that?\n\n00:22:32,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, sure. Well, you know, aligned with what we were talking about, about the Macri interview, you know, this was a really interesting update and it has implications, I think, for the broader Gene therapy space, you know, if you take a step back, right, I mean, Gene therapy has been out of favor for a variety of reasons. One being, I think there's a lot of investors who are still or becoming more skeptical of, you know, the launch model for these products, although it's in our view, it's really disease dependent. But nonetheless, I mean, one of the overhangs for this space has been that, you know, under Peter Marks, we saw a bunch of gene therapy companies aligned with the agency on pretty favorable regulatory uh setups. Right. You can look at Rocket, who's doing a 12-page, 12-patient pivotal study. And you can look at how Sarepta got approved in DMD on pretty mixed data, a bunch of other examples as well. Unicure had been talking about being able to potentially file on the comparison of a Phase 1-2 study for their Huntington's gene therapy. versus natural history and for context that study did have a placebo arm at one year.\n\n00:23:33,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n But there wasn't much separation. We can debate why, right? It might be because the drug's not working that well, or it might be because in Huntington's patients progressed pretty slowly in year one. And, you know, you can't really— you're not really realistically going to— improve people that much on the drug arm. And so the natural history comparison that they show at two years and we'll get three-year data this year looks pretty promising with 80% disease slowing. But I think you know— The street was pretty heavily discounting this after Peter Marks left. And I think we've seen a greater discounting of other gene therapy, regulatory alignments, and things in rare disease like that, like Denali. And so this Unicure breakthrough, I think, is a big deal because, you know, 'breakthrough' essentially shows that the FDA views the data as promising and also they announced 'breakthrough' after Peter Mark's left, right— which aligns with what Unicure had been saying. You know, they believe their regulatory alignment was not Peter Marks dependent. They believe it was, you know, deep within CBER and the division. And so I think it's a big deal for them. You know, the next catalyst there is they're going to have three-year data.\n\n00:24:34,190 [SPEAKER_4]\n They're also going to have an update on the exact. statistical plan and how they're going to do this sort of primary registrational analysis between phase one, two and natural history. But also for me, it makes me more confident that for other companies in the gene therapy space, you know, the regulatory flexibility bull case may still be on.\n\n00:25:05,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n Daphne, are you on mute?\n\n00:25:06,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh yeah, sorry. Uh, Thank you. So Josh, you've been tracking the American Urological Association conference this weekend as J &J and CG Oncology are facing off in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Can you tell us more about it?\n\n00:25:24,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh, it looks like we might have lost Josh. All right, we'll skip to the next topic and come back. Um, so let's actually talk about the.\n\n00:25:37,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tim, Stifel had shared a biotech market update that included details on what's happening on the buy side.

Eric Schmidt from Cantor put out a really interesting report on short selling on Monday. Unfortunately, he couldn't be on, but Josh is going to be his representative once we get him back. I'll talk a little bit about the Stiefel study. Once a year, what we do at Stiefel is we look at the buy side. In biotech, we look at it fairly comprehensively. There's two types of data that we look at, and I want to be very careful. Kind of identifying what they are. So once a year, if you are a registered investment advisor, which almost all biotech hedge funds are and long-only funds are, you have to file a report with the SEC in which you disclose your assets under management, AUM. Asset under management could include cash long positions and also short positions. By the way, you could even go buy like dry cleaner stocks or whatever.\n\n00:26:42,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, whatever you do is going to be in your AUM. At the same time, we also looked at biotech holdings. So, how much long biotech positions these funds have. So a couple of very interesting things came out. The first is that, as of last year, so this is 2024, that the the net biotech holdings of specialist funds went down. That is, the long positions went down, but the number of funds actually went up. And the assets under management of those funds was essentially unchanged. So, if you will, specialists went a lot more short last year. And then, if you look at which funds actually lost AUM and which funds gained AUM, this is where it gets interesting. It's very relevant for Eric Schmidt's report. What we saw was that the funds that we're able to do long/short, or were able to do multi-strat, either stayed the same or gained assets on average last year, whereas the funds that were longer only— not surprisingly— on average lost assets.\n\n00:27:44,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that's, of course, because it wasn't a great year. Last year, and so it's you know, it's very relevant. You sort of think about all this shorting activity: is it a good thing, is it a bad thing? The other thing that was interesting— don't want to dwell on the companies that lost some assets. But there were a couple like, you know, the past we've talked about armistice, right? So they had like massive asset outflow, which is very visible in all these data. What was interesting is to look at the companies that gained assets. And we tend to focus on, you know, the bad news in our sector, especially these days. But there were so many groups that gained assets. And so some of them were smaller, high-performing hedge fund groups like Catalio, 8R1, SilverArk, Darwin. And then the other thing that was interesting to me is that some of these groups that will play in the public space but are like more PE or venture focused did really well. So Forbion gained huge amount of assets last year. Sofanova Partners, a French company, gained a lot of assets.\n\n00:28:45,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n Patient Square gained huge assets last year. And so you hear the message, which is: it feels like, gosh, we're in this existential moment. Is biotech viable? Actually, our sector is doing just fine on the asset manager side. It's just a lot of folks on the specialist side, let's be short. This has nothing to do with Q1, which is what we're living through. Sort of right now in Q2, it's been kind of bumpy, although it feels like things are turning.\n\n00:29:12,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, the specialist investor was in good shape on average coming into 2025.\n\n00:29:23,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Josh, can you comment on this report on short selling?","char_start":26127,"char_end":30028,"start_time":"00:25:37","end_time":null}

So I think Eric kind of goaded me into taking a very a different position and conclusion. He kind of pointed his finger at the hedge funds, so planning on how their short selling was a powerful external pressure to an already fragile industry. That maybe the industry would be better off without. I think for me, though. The hedge funds are basically doing their job. I mean, that's what hedge funds do. They long and they short, and that's part of the capital markets. And in biotech, you don't get to pick and choose what part of the capital markets. We want to apply to us because some [some] may be inconvenient and [and] there is there is] a reason why The XBI hasn't gone anywhere in five or more years, and there's a reason why many companies trade below. cash because it's not like they're ever really going to give that cash back to investors. It's more like prepaid expenses. So maybe instead of referring to it as cash, if we just referred to it as what it really is for the most part— prepaid expenses— we wouldn't really look at that as any relevant metric whatsoever.\n\n00:30:37,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n The reason that the industry is struggling is all; it's like literally everybody's fault aside from the hedge funds, right? The sector is very complex. It's very volatile. It's full of failure. It consumes a never-ending amount of capital in fairly inefficient ways. It almost never returns that capital to shareholders. Very few companies have a truly sustainable business model over the long term beyond one or two product successes.\n\n00:31:05,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n And if you have a business model that can account for patent cliffs and now the IRA as well, and on top of that, now we have competition from China.\n\n00:31:15,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, we've created this wonderful industry of innovation. But we've created. created it in a very vulnerable, fragile way. That does attract short investors and does not attract generalist investors, and that's okay. Right, the sector is what we make it to be, but we can't necessarily lament how the capital markets may be working against this sector.\n\n00:31:42,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n Lament that generalist investors aren't coming along to save us, and we can't lament that pharma companies aren't coming along to save the entire industry. You know, it's an industry of some winners and a lot of losers. And if you're a very skilled, thoughtful, and experienced investor, you know, you can do quite well in terms of generating returns.\n\n00:32:03,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, you know, again, it requires either a lot of skill, experience, and a little bit of luck, or less skill and experience, and a lot of good luck. To thrive in this world, so it was kind of a fun back and forth to write with Eric.\n\n00:32:21,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Josh, Eric was really saying, 'Hey.' Like some of these companies are so vulnerable, maybe the shorting really is destroying companies. I don't doubt that there's a biotech or two that's been crushed by short sellers.\n\n00:32:35,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n But your point is so well taken, which is there is a free market process. That attracts capital. Sometimes that's on the short side.\n\n00:32:44,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes.\n\n00:32:45,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and I'll comment as well, a couple of points. The point about generalists and not having as many generalists. Attracted to biotech recently, I think there's also some practices like the wall cross pipes, which I think tend to make it even harder for generalists to to understand the industry and do well. So you know, if a wall cross pipe happens and the financing happens before the data, you don't get that sort of big stock appreciation that you would get in the absence of that.","char_start":29728,"char_end":33769,"start_time":"00:29:12","end_time":null}

And that also creates, you know, some downside once the financing is announced. But in general, the wall cross pipes have been, I think, very negative. And there's other examples like that. And then I'll just make a point as a CEO. I've always felt like short sellers are actually kind of a positive influence in some ways, in that they, you know, if they come into your stock and then you have positive news, you basically get some really great appreciation for the stock when they have to cover. And in general, I think they keep people kind of focused on what the downsides are. So if you're running a company and you're doing well, I don't know that they have that big of an influence. So they can manipulate. Highly illiquid stocks— does anybody else have any comments on the short selling phenomenon and the comments that were just made?\n\n00:34:18,949 [SPEAKER_3]\n Now, all right, we'll work. At the risk of touching on a third rail topic, John Merganori and Tim in the email thread leading up to this mentioned that this topic of Trump versus universities like Harvard has some implications for our industry. John and Tim, do you want to kick it off? John, first.\n\n00:34:40,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, let me kick it off. I mean, I think everybody's seen the news reports of government actions toward universities like 300. an 88-year-old Harvard, you know, actions toward, you know, academic research institutions. And we're now even seeing reports, again, in the media of actions toward venerable research journals like the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n00:35:07,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n And in some cases, or maybe all these cases, maybe in some cases, these actions are purported to be linked to intolerance of antisemitism. Which I completely agree with, and also to DEI practices, which are grossly disfavored, unfortunately.\n\n00:35:27,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, some of us may question that those are really the real reasons that are going on. And I don't actually think we should discuss the reasons for these actions. It's, I think, outside of the scope of. of a biotech hangout discussion. And I think people on this call probably all have very personal views on this matter. And I don't think we should talk about it, but we should talk about what does it means for our industry, regardless of the merits.\n\n00:35:54,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n I do think we need to talk about that because I am worried about these actions, whether meritorious or not, having an implication on U. S. competitiveness, U. S. scientific excellence. There are China implications as it relates to this growing competitiveness of the Chinese biotech sector, which is I'm sure to surprise all of us. There are medium and longer term impacts. I don't imagine that. These government actions will have any immediate impact on biotech companies, per se, but there are certainly medium and longer term impacts of this, because after all, academic funding is the top of the funnel for all of our companies' innovation, for the most part. Then there are implications for freedom of speech and peer review and so forth, preeminence of U. S. journals. I mean, the list goes on. And I do think we need to be conscious of it, just to understand the implications.\n\n00:36:58,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n We should be able to talk about it freely and openly, and also consider how we as an industry need to respond to these type of actions.\n\n00:37:11,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n And so, Tim, I don't know if you want to. Add any more context to it, but we can go from there.\n\n00:37:18,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, John, I think I'm on your side on this one and probably even more strong views. So I just want to make three points. The first point. is that our industry grew up around academic institutions. It's no secret that the biotech ecosystem in Boston came out of Harvard and MIT.","char_start":33469,"char_end":37697,"start_time":"00:33:21","end_time":null}

So I just want to make three points. The first point. is that our industry grew up around academic institutions. It's no secret that the biotech ecosystem in Boston came out of Harvard and MIT.\n\n00:37:39,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's no secret that the strong biotech ecosystem in San Francisco came out of Berkeley, UCSF, Stanford, and so those institutions are ground zero for our industry and continue to be important sources of innovation. It's nice that innovation is democratizing. It's not all Harvard. UCSF at this point. But those are very important institutions. My second point is, why is Trump doing this? Does Trump actually you know, think that Harvard is out of control or what have you. And I think it's very important if you look at some of the intellectual underpinnings, if you might say that there are some behind sort of the modern populist conservative movement. And when I say that, I mean a lot more than Trump. So, like in Hungary, we have Viktor Orban, who has made a massive assault on academic freedom. And so what's very interesting is if you search a man named Antonio Gramsci, who's actually a Marxist theorist of all things, he's very well studied and very well liked by the right wing.\n\n00:38:48,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n Grubsheet just makes a very important point. which is culture. in academics.\n\n00:38:55,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n are critically important to controlling a society. In other words, if you want your party to have influence on a society, you need to influence through cultural means, which we see in things like social media. And you also need to have influence on the university system. So what, to someone who's grown up as, you know, thinking about the Enlightenment and thinking about liberalism, you know, seems like an assault on. academic freedom or freedom of speech. to someone who is focused on political control.\n\n00:39:30,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Being able to cause those institutions to be more compliant is actually very important. And of course, another very important aspect is Trump is playing to his base, right? So he's trying to appear— to be combating you know woke people in these institutions and I'm sure there are some people that have you know, points of view that are very different than the majority of our society. But isn't in a way that's supposed to be. Kind of the idea of these institutions. My third point is where this is all going to end up. And, you know, there are a lot of discussions about NIH cuts. They happen to happen, just to be clear. But those could be profoundly harmful to our industry. Because NIH research is. kind of where a lot of biotech get started. But I do think that it's very noteworthy that Trump's standing in the polls, even with his own supporters, has really plummeted in the last month. And just like we're sort of seeing him back off on tariffs, which has been very good for biotech.\n\n00:40:30,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n I do think that these conversations about Harvard and so on, I hope maybe that's wishful thinking, will end up being more like the conversation we were having about Greenland. or annexing Canada eight weeks ago. It's really more a conversation with this base than a real intention to restrict academic freedom at Harvard University. That's my hope.\n\n00:40:51,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, thanks for setting that up. And, you know, I think that if we look at that Grachi framework. The counterpoint really is that these elite academic institutions like Harvard have been accepting large sums of foreign funding from governments such as Qatar and China. With limited transparency. And Qatar, for example, has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into American universities, often through unrestricted gifts or targeted research centers. And these funds aren't purely academic in nature, but they're actually strategic investments to shape ideology. And this influence has supported a strong atmosphere in the case of one area, anti-Semitism or racism.","char_start":37397,"char_end":41446,"start_time":"00:37:39","end_time":null}

So I think what's most troubling about this ideological drift is not it's not limited to fringe voices. It's being normalized in classrooms, student organizations and faculty circles. I do think that with regard to the universities and how they're managed, it does raise the question of how these universities are handling. The conflict and how do they work. With the administration, which is a major funding source, just like any other funding source. To try to address concerns while maintaining academic freedom. It's important to note that they're not entirely free— they're taking money from other places as well. Josh, do you want to comment? And then I definitely want to make sure we talk about. Advice for CEOs and one other data point before we close the show. Go ahead, Josh.\n\n00:42:36,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, sure. I mean, if anyone's read the actual legal brief that Harvard submitted as part of their litigation process.\n\n00:42:45,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n It acknowledges how horrible antisemitism has been on its campus. Honestly, my social media feed is filled with this. I'm surprised that the topic of antisemitism is so easily cast aside.\n\n00:42:58,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, and the legal brief admits they have a long way to go to be compliant with the laws. It lists some of the actions that they've taken to protect Jewish students on campus. And honestly, I find them. Quite laughable, I suspect, if you went and asked Jewish students at Harvard if they feel safe and protected now, after some of these responses, they would still say no. As evidence of the fact that Jewish enrollment in Harvard is plummeting to near all-time lows at an institution that has always had a reputation for not being friendly to the Jewish community. Community. And so what I would say is: let's hope Harvard figures out how to get its act together to protect its minority groups, all of them, not just electively, but minorities, including Jewish students, let's hope that they do that so that they can not only keep the $6 billion of annual funding they still get from the government, but the extra $2 billion that was stripped away, in addition to the $50 billion of endowments that they have, the student tuitions, and all the foreign funds that they're happy to accept.\n\n00:44:04,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n So let's go, Harvard. Let's go to all the other Ivy Leagues who are tolerating the anti-Semitism on campus. So that there's no longer an excuse for the government to strip away their funds.\n\n00:44:17,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n And again, I didn't want to get into the discussion around the merits of all this. And you and Daphne bring up amazingly important points, which I completely agree with. At the same time, we have— academic institutions that are central to our industry. And we just cannot, we must find answers here that preserve them. That preserve the value that they bring to our biomedical research enterprise, to our competitiveness as a country. And we must get through this without decimation of, you know, the, the amazing institutions of, of the academy at the end of the day. I think we all agree with that.\n\n00:45:04,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n A hundred percent agree. And I think that there would be nothing bad than to see these very powerful scientific constituencies of these elite universities actually stepping up and forcing the universities to protect the Jewish community, and in doing so, protect them as well against these fringe groups that have become so disruptive. I 100% agree. It is time for everyone to really step up and put an end to the tolerance of these activities. So, John, to your point, and Tim, to your point, these absolute pillars of academic innovation for science and beyond can continue to thrive.\n\n00:45:43,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great.

And I really wish that in general, that was the dialogue that was happening. More broadly. So, you know, thank you everyone for the commentary on this topic. And I think it was important to touch on it. Josh, I know that you're going to have to jump right at the top of the hour. We got a little bit of a late start, so we're going to continue past one.\n\n00:46:17,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n Before you go, do you want to talk about the American Urological Association Conference, J &J, and CG Oncology facing off?\n\n00:46:24,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, I would love to because we're now a year past the 2024 AUA that started this whole battle in motion. J &J's TAR-200, which is a drug device combination that's inserted into the bladder for treatment of NMIBC, came out swinging a year ago with very strong projections of what their 12-month complete response rate was going to be. CG Oncology at the time presented data that was much more mature. And at the time, it looked like J &J's TAR 200 product had a CR advantage at the 12-month time points, but it was a bit of an apples to oranges comparison. Because one data set was much more mature than the other. And this has been a debate that we've basically been mired in. I do cover CG oncology for the past year. The CG oncology G-Bowls. Um, you know, suspected as the data uh evolves that that that see our advantage that J &J has over creatostimid gene, C.\n\n00:47:32,153 [SPEAKER_1]\n G. Oncology's product. Will contract to the point of essentially being irrelevant for clinicians, whereas bears have noted that the delta, which is close to 10%, maybe a little lower, it actually got narrower. At ESMO of last year's kind of as the J &J data matured. It looked like they still do have a CR advantage. At least at that point. And this has been something that, again, for the last year since last AUA has been a topic of intense debate. Who's got the higher CR rate? So Saturday, we're going to put this argument to bed, hopefully, because we'll have full, mature data. From both companies presented in back-to-back plenaries. And then hopefully we'll be able to move on from that battle, hopefully start to think about the very vast unmet medical need. That these patients have. They do need multiple options to keep their disease at bay for as long as possible before they wind up requiring a bladder resection surgery, which is very invasive.\n\n00:48:41,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, we may now roll over this who's got the better CR rate into the two-year follow-up and kind of playing the same playbook that. that was laid out at AOA last year. We'll see if that's something that we do have to deal with. I think, from my perspective, eager to get past this weekend. So now we can stop this kind of very short-term focused who has the higher CR and now start to talk about what the treatment landscape may look like with two really good options coming to patients.\n\n00:49:15,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's fascinating. Thank you, Josh. So we talked a little bit about short sellers. We talked about the industry and how tough it is. I can tell you guys that I'm. Part of a number of different CEO groups, obviously Bio, John and I are on the board of Bio. I'm involved with No Patient Left Behind, which is an excellent organization that I recommend people look up. And then the biotech CEO sisterhood, which is a really amazing group I think it's almost 400 CEOs. It's a really tough time to be a CEO in biotech.

Tell us a little bit more about it.\n\n00:50:00,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no, Andrew Dunn did a nice story to try to, you know, get a few ideas out there for CEOs as they think about, you know, capitalizing their companies, getting through this current environment with capital markets being very challenging. And obviously it was good to spend some time with them and offer some. some learnings. You know, the one thing that didn't come up in that though, that, that, you know, since we're getting close to the end of this discussion, I think is worth mentioning is the important role. And frankly, other leaders and companies play during these tough environments with their teams. And that's not been talked about enough, I would say.\n\n00:50:40,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n I had a breakfast this morning with one of my colleagues, and we were both talking about this point. And it is amazingly important for those on the call—those here that are either in a leadership position or CEOs themselves— to really reflect on how important it is that they can help their teams through these very turbulent times, think about what's important for the business, think about patience and making an impact, and obviously be the real leader they need to be. It's really a- moment of time in which leadership shines, needs to shine. And it's an opportunity for all of us in this industry to bring in our best when we come into the office or come out to the Zoom call, whatever it is. And so I think that is an opportunity for us to help and contribute to the broader enterprise that we're all involved with.\n\n00:51:35,850 [SPEAKER_4]\n Hey, John, can I ask you a question? Yeah.\n\n00:51:39,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n If you were still the CEO of Al Milam, what would be some of your plans to position yourself. You know, relative to some of these potential macro changes like. Like something like tariffs, right? Where you want to prepare as a company. Also, changing your supply chain is a massive investment that takes time and is disruptive. And so, maybe you don't want to go overboard if you don't think. Tariffs are going to be durably in place. But how do you like? How do you stay nimble and prepared and be proactive but not reactive? Like, what would be your perspective there?\n\n00:52:13,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, you know, part of it— and specifically, you know, to the El Nile story, I mean, I would be thankful that a lot of our API manufacturing is done in the country and just happens to be that way. Not all of it, but most of it. And I'd be super thankful that the company is close to profitability. At this point in time. So, you know, it's a very different case than, you know, than some of the companies I'm helping build right now that are, you know, very, very. different stages of their, of their life cycle. But there are, you know, there definitely are supply chain implications, even for an L-nylum raw material aspects. to be considered and so forth that come from all parts of the world and how terrorists will impact all that is going to play out over time. But I do think— you know, the larger companies like Denel Nyalum, Vertex, Regeneron, those companies are thinking a lot about how they need to. secure greater confidence in their supply chains, and they're probably investing meaningfully in securing that.\n\n00:53:22,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n That domicile security. And so it is a natural reaction. It wasn't just through the Trump administration. Say, just more broadly, the geopolitical risks that exist out there that were exacerbated by Russia and Ukraine and other things that we've all been aware of. It's a complex world right now, for sure.\n\n00:53:47,009 [SPEAKER_3]\n John, any other tips that you want to share with biotech CEOs? And maybe actually we have a few more minutes because we started late because of the music that we had in the background. Maybe we'll just go around. You can kick it off.

I do think that company strategy-wise, you need to be super focused on. balance sheet preservation while focusing the capital and the resource plans on the biggest value driving activity. which are often the ones that move the needle for patients ultimately. But that needs to be the core focus. You probably have to put some of your, you know, operational plans on hold for a little bit. Um, you know, put them either on the shelf or find a way to finance them through partnerships. I'm not a big fan of spin-outs. I wouldn't do that. But there are clever ways to think about business development more in this environment than before, without giving away the company, if you will. So these are all the tactics that CEOs need to and their boards and their teams need to avail themselves of in this environment.\n\n00:55:21,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n Survive through it. We will get through it. We will get to the other side. There will be broader days ahead. There's no doubt about that. There will be some Darwinian evolution. Some companies that don't make it. That is to be expected. But we will be a stronger industry on the other side of this. Better people, better science, more focused teams that have got the experience. And so we will be stronger. And I'll stop there.\n\n00:55:50,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n Josh, I don't know if you have a minute before you need to go, but do you want to comment on that?\n\n00:55:55,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Advice for CEOs.\n\n00:55:58,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n No. Paul?\n\n00:56:00,870 [SPEAKER_5]\n I mean, everything, John's much more qualified to give this advice than me, but I would just say, you know, for the development stage companies.\n\n00:56:09,360 [SPEAKER_5]\n Be mindful of the studies you're running and the data that you release. What I'm hearing from investors when they're thinking about catalysts in a market like this, especially catalysts for companies that have cash needs that might raise in the back of data, is: I think it's really important for a catalyst or a data update. Um, to answer a key investment question, you know, like something that actually can materially move probability of success. And so, trickling out, you know, a patient or two of data or an update on something where, hey, we think this looks interesting, it's promising, it's still early. I think sometimes, especially for earlier companies, companies have gone public in the past. Couple years you know you only get one or two chances to really have a market-moving catalyst where you can actually get the attention of people. This is a market that is punitive for data that doesn't really de-risk anything when investors think that a company might raise in the back of it, right? So I think like you got to hold whatever you're disclosing to that level of standard.\n\n00:57:13,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's a really good point. So the point that if you put out data that is sort of marginal, not key catalyst, people might actually punish you because they're expecting you to raise money on the other side of it. I think that's really interesting. Tim, did you want to make any comments or advice to CEOs?\n\n00:57:31,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think the big lesson of the last couple of years with the China competition is that US and European companies can and probably should become much more efficient. I sort of assume that that's just like obvious and everyone's absorbing it. But I actually saw a presentation this week by a company backed by, say, five really good mainstream VCs. sort of maybe like, John, some of the ones you're involved in, you know, in Boston.\n\n00:57:58,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n really great people. They put up a budget showing that, to get to an IND, they were going to spend 55 million dollars and I just kind of like was sort of in the back of my mind saying, 'How did this still happen, right?' I mean, they have one molecule.\n\n00:58:15,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n They knew the target, and it's $55 million from SART to an IND.","char_start":52956,"char_end":57445,"start_time":"00:54:11","end_time":null}

S. biotech community at least from my perspective.\n\n00:58:29,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n Wow, that's really interesting. I think that, that also aligns with some of the comments John made about preserving cash, just to be able to see another day. But I think overall, this conversation brings up that you know we're in. There are some positive. Things happening with regard to the FDA and other changes, it's a very volatile time. And this industry is very important, obviously. And I hope that many of my colleagues can take some of this advice and that it will be helpful to them.","char_start":57145,"char_end":58109,"start_time":"00:58:15","end_time":null}

With a group of biotech insiders, I'm Eric Schmidt. I'm joined today by My co-host Sam Pizzelli and special guests Adam Feuerstein and Peter Kulczynski. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. Uh, Adam, Peter, Sam— thank you very much for joining busy, busy week in the industry this week with um, uh, not just earnings and a bunch of news, data sets, events, stock moving, impacts all over the place, but— Thank you. I was taken, Adam, by your tweet from earlier in the week about the fact that I think it's now three straight weeks.\n\n00:00:45,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n The XBI moving in the right direction. People do seem like they're a little bit less unhappy, maybe even somewhat happy about things. Um, tell us about your take on on mood and sentiment out there and yeah, it's the worst really behind us.\n\n00:01:01,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, we hope so, right? I mean, we're definitely.\n\n00:01:04,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, I feel like after sort of being the messenger of doom, for weeks and weeks and weeks, I felt like it was time to maybe be a little bit more constructive.\n\n00:01:15,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I do sense that there is a little bit of maybe this feeling that the sky is not necessarily falling yet. I guess, relatively speaking, that is being happy. So, and I think, you know, we're seeing that there's been a nice rebound. In the XBI off the you know kind of the early April low, right and um it seems like it's sticking around so You know, plus we've got some good news, right? Some good, really strong drug launches. We had a couple of deals, so. I think things are improving.\n\n00:01:51,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n And are we really in recovery mode? And if so, what actually has changed?\n\n00:01:56,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, you tell me, Eric. I think maybe by your question, you're casting doubts on that. So what are your thoughts on it?\n\n00:02:04,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I guess I'm I'm still scratching my head. I don't. Pretend to have any of the answers and we'll bring Peter and Sam into this conversation in a moment. I mean, from where I said some of what you tweeted certainly does ring true. The drug launches are working. That's been a constant theme, probably for the past six to 12 months, not just the last three weeks. But certainly we saw that in shining colors with Q1 earnings, which generally I would say, and we'll talk about a lot of the companies that produced results this week, but generally speaking, I thought there was more. More good than bad in the earnings. And we saw some M &A also, which we'll talk about this week as well. I think you or Sam were going to cover that for us. So that's always a nice little kicker, but I don't think anyone believes that, you know.\n\n00:02:52,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Two smaller-ish deals are going to make a trend in M &A. So my greater concern in the back of my mind is still, honestly, the FDA. Peter, I know that's something that you've been very, very vocal and focused on and also. And my concern specifically is that, yeah, we didn't have any terrible, terrible news this week, but we had. Amidst pedophilia, we had. Still some headlines that certainly make me unsettled. And I think the FDA continues to hang in a balance that's very precarious at this point in time. But maybe, Peter, good time for you to talk about your views there.\n\n00:03:28,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so I think April was one hell of a stress test of our industry, of the whole market. I mean, we weren't alone. This, but we had a few biotech-specific issues.","char_start":0,"char_end":3724,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I mean, we weren't alone. This, but we had a few biotech-specific issues.\n\n00:03:41,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I think that what it revealed to us is the power of protest. You don't just sit back and say, 'I don't know,' I'm sure somehow this will get resolved. It can't be that this will, you know, that the the FDA will be dismantled or whatever. So, you know, it's like a vaccination, right? It likes to rev your immune system up and that immune system's gotta like. Actually, keep protecting you. So in that respect, it was heartening. It was heartening to see that, when we saw the things seemed to be Be really unstable at the FDA, that, you know, a number of us were able to pull together, you know, analyze, frankly, like you got to analyze what's going on. You got to talk to the people that are on the inside and then you know start engaging with some of the people that have influence— members of Congress, people at the FDA, people in the administration.\n\n00:04:43,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n And then, you know, you're never quite told that, like, yes, we will do this. Instead, you have to read what's put out there publicly. And so we've all started to see some of the signals that the FDA won't go through a major reorganization. And that's reassuring. I hope it doesn't result in complacency, right? A feeling like, 'Oh, now everything's fine.' because we got a long road ahead of us, right? Like nobody's ever tried to dismantle, you know, this many pillars of the economic and drug development model to throw tariffs and most favored nation price controls and reorganizing the FDA.\n\n00:05:29,039 [SPEAKER_1]\n and who knows how many other um you know constants uh will turn into variables so um i think we got to be on high alert uh but i i agree with you that but for those um those new variables shall we say uh biotech and the whole pharma model is still working you know investors flock to pharma stocks uh you know when the market started to fall apart and that there was a flight to safety. I love that. The fact that the world, however much it hates pharma, however much it might be distressed by all that's going on, on sees pharma as safe. It's like, yeah, that's right. People get sick. They need their medicine. They're not thinking about recession or no recession. They're not worried about geopolitics. Their disease is their whole world. And so they prioritize getting care and their doctor prioritizes them and they'll write the script and they'll get the prior authorization and then insurance will cover it. And, you know, that is ultimately how the returns are generated and that is happening through thick and thin.\n\n00:06:30,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n So seeing our companies continue to execute through all this is, you know, kind of how we ultimately recalibrate to the core of our own portfolio and just say, like, all right, the world's crazy, but actually things are working. So we just got to protect all that is working and trust that, you know, medicines will continue to generate value. Certainly, the science is still working, you know, if you completely defund the NIH. You know, we may have less of it in 10 years, but in the very near term, the projects that we're all funding, they're, you know, independent of, you know, NIH funding or whatever. Not that the administration's talking about defunding the whole NIH, just changing the way the NIH funds. I'll pause there.\n\n00:07:18,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, what are your thoughts? Are you less worried about some of the macro considerations we've been talking about over the past weeks, tariffs, reference pricing, China competition?\n\n00:07:30,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n Look, Eric, I've never been particularly worried about China competition because, you know, my view has always been that money should go with sciences. And actually, if you listen to some of the pharma companies, they still keep going on about, 'look, there's assets there that we like, and then we're going to go and license them or access them.' The problem I think that we're all facing is just uncertainty.","char_start":3426,"char_end":7695,"start_time":"00:03:28","end_time":null}

The problem I think that we're all facing is just uncertainty.\n\n00:08:01,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n We've all learned that it's possible that, over time, the next however many years this lasts— the way that it's been going— is that you never know what's going to happen next or who's going to say what next. Um and the folks in charge seem to not worry about the words necessarily that they speak, and it moves the markets so. But specifically in terms of what BY has been doing recently, and I think we bounced back with the rest of the market. There's also that element of possibility that folks are looking for it. Interest rate cuts. So that's always been something that we've all wanted to see as a way of making money come back to risk assets.\n\n00:08:46,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that's what we're seeing. The uncertainties around FDA, HHS, coverage of vaccines, what vaccines you're going to be approving or not, what kind of reactions.\n\n00:08:58,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bye. Companies are— getting from the FDA. All the pharma companies, unless it's because they don't want to put their head above the parapet too much, say that their conversations with the FDA have been fine. They haven't noticed anything. So they've seen, maybe, there's a disconnect. Um, obviously, Adam's probably in touch with, and you guys are probably in touch a lot more with the smaller biotechs, and maybe you're hearing more so I don't know where that disconnect is coming from if there is one.\n\n00:09:30,120 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, let's talk about the FDA in a moment, but maybe Adam, I'll let you have the last word on this topic.\n\n00:09:35,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, I mean, I agree with what Peter said, you know, particularly about being vigilant, right? I think. That that's super important.\n\n00:09:45,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think a lot of people are really tuned into companies and how they're interacting with the FDA and things that are happening and the statements that are being made. Because, you know, and there are certain key individuals and officials at the FDA who are still there and maybe. maybe hanging on by a thread, but are still there and are really important to the way that that place operates and functions. All those things are important. Things can change. As we've seen, things can change day by day. It's a little bit crazy. I think Peter's right that we just have to kind of keep watching it and, you know, just on the fly.\n\n00:10:22,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, Peter, you sounded— or alluded to— being a little bit more optimistic about the FDA and the maybe past week or so. And I guess alluded to some comments that perhaps Commissioner Macri had made about not restructuring the agency.\n\n00:10:38,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, you know, there's also been the last week or two comments from his office about his views on vaccines and he is certainly restructuring. Policy toward vaccine approvals, it seems, both with COVID vaccines and maybe other seasonal vaccines. Do you get the sense that he can separate himself from RFK Jr.?\n\n00:11:00,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Do you think he needs to in order to have a healthy FDA ecosystem?\n\n00:11:05,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n It seems to be evolving day by day, right?\n\n00:11:10,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think that vaccine seems to be to be a special area of chaos at the FDA.\n\n00:11:20,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm more optimistic on everything non-vaccine, but I think that if vaccines go in a unscientific direction, like you know, calling for vaccines to be tested against placebo when really you're developing a better version of an existing vaccine, maybe with broader coverage, and it would be completely unethical to run a true placebo. That's not scientific. That's not in alignment with clinical practice. And so if they use this facile notion that the only real science is done versus a placebo control, that's just demagoguery, right? They're just tricking people into trying to go along with their unscientific agenda.\n\n00:12:17,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n Can the new FDA commissioner, McCary, can he protect us all from that? Or will he allow it to go forward? We're watching, right? You know, so if he caves on vaccines, then, you know, I'm going to be a bit more worried than anywhere else. Where it's a hot topic, he may cave there.","char_start":7395,"char_end":11857,"start_time":"00:08:01","end_time":null}

Where it's a hot topic, he may cave there.\n\n00:12:43,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n I hope that, for example, we're not going to see flu vaccines, which are obviously changed every season, have to go through new trials, because then the flu season is going to end. To be mostly over by the time you get your flu vaccine. So that would be pretty foolish. But that does seem to be what they're suggesting for COVID vaccines. If they require a pre-approval trial, then you're not going to be able to really keep up with COVID straight changes nearly as effectively, if at all. Right. So we're watching and I honestly can't wait till we're done with this phase, because the thing about vaccines is.\n\n00:13:25,829 [SPEAKER_1]\n They don't need us to speak up for them. Like the disease is doing all the speaking, right? And so you wait long enough without vaccines, people will be reminded. Why we have vaccines. But there's a lot of other science that's less clear where you're not going to know what you're missing. So I hope that all this chaos really does stop at vaccines, at worst, and doesn't end up infecting other disease areas.\n\n00:13:55,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Hey, Eric, can I chime in a second? I think I mean, I am truly worried that, Bakari, like, there's going to be no he's— much less independent— or has the ability to be independent from RFK Jr. on vaccines. I think.\n\n00:14:11,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n It seems like maybe there's been some kind of grand bargain where, you know, they're going to let RFK and that. sort of anti-vaccine element just run wild in vaccines and i think that's pretty scary uh and not great you know it's um and hopefully it doesn't you know as peter said hopefully it doesn't uh move over into into the drug in the drug area But it sure does seem like, you know, just again, like Peter said, like these comments about having to potentially do placebo controlled studies for vaccines. It means, um, you know, everything is being couched. I mean, you can look at someone like a kaylee, means, right, like you know, kind of the lead sort of maha guy out there who you know, he's just mocking people for things like, if you if you believe that, you if you believe you're you know, you're anti-science, if you disagree with the idea of running a placebo-controlled trial for a vaccine, where we know that that's, as Peter said, it's unethical in a lot of ways to do that.\n\n00:15:16,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n But it's just the rhetoric that's out there is just out of control.\n\n00:15:22,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n I haven't seen any pushback from Makari on that. And that's troubling.\n\n00:15:30,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, let's leave the vaccine issue aside and hope that it is encapsulated and separated from the rest of what's going on at the FDA, though we still obviously have concerns about other things that are happening at the agency.\n\n00:15:44,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Turmoil, the potential for delays, the turnover, the staff culture. Sam, you noted that, on the pharma earnings calls this week, least the larger companies were putting on a smiley face and saying that everything's all good. I did come across a mass bio survey. This was actually part of my trip down to Washington, where we met with some congressional leaders to talk about how they might be able to help settle the FDA down a little bit. And MassBio did a survey just a few weeks after the FDA workforce reductions.\n\n00:16:18,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think they surveyed 88 of their members and a full 50% of the respondents said that they had experienced some. Some change in their regulatory discussion not always a delay, certainly nothing like a Paducah delay, though we did, I think, have one to do for date come and go with no response. A company called Stealth Bio which we can talk about. But yeah, I was kind of surprised.\n\n00:16:44,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Concerned about the 50 of respondents who who said that already meetings had been pushed out or work. Timelines had been extended for whatever reason. Um, Sam, I don't know if that's something you you know you want to comment whether you're similarly anxious or you think these smaller companies are being more truthful with us.","char_start":11557,"char_end":15952,"start_time":"00:12:43","end_time":null}

I was at AACR. And then at a pre-meeting at AACR. And a whole bunch of people presented from a lot of the larger, pretty much all the large pharma companies. And frankly, every single one of them said, 'No, we're not seeing any change in our discussion or interactions with the FDA.'\n\n00:17:33,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n As I said, where is that?\n\n00:17:37,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n difference coming from? What is it that they're dealing with? Is it because, I don't know, maybe they have better systems in place or maybe the FDA is prioritizing the larger? I mean, I hope not, right? It should be driven by the PDUFO, by the by the work that they're doing, and so it's puzzling for me why this is the case. In fact, one company I asked they had this: I'm not going to name the company. They had a single-arm trial that helped get their drug approved. Oncology, obviously, single out trial. I said, do you believe that you'd be able to get that same type of trial approved again? It was breakthrough, et cetera. And the response was, 'Yeah, we haven't noticed anything different about our interactions with the FDA. We're confident that we can get this approved again if we had to do it.' So there's that element: is it because they don't want to mix things up too much?\n\n00:18:36,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n But if you look at the tariff conversations, they're all saying, you know, obviously the tariffs is not the right way to do things, but we can absorb it. And we're all ready. We're all preparing our manufacturing so that we can switch into the US if we need to, or we're doing it anyway.\n\n00:18:53,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is it because they don't want to upset the car? I don't know.\n\n00:18:58,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n I can offer a quick view on this if you're interested.\n\n00:19:04,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, Peter, yeah. And I also know you're doing more than just listening. You're acting. So we'd love to hear about what No Patient Left Behind is actually doing. Maybe wonderful in some respects that a crisis like this forces the industry to come together and push for action.\n\n00:19:18,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so thanks for pointing that out. I hadn't mentioned NPLB, but yeah, no patient left behind. Pretty powerful new tool in our community's toolkit. It really is like this gathering spot for concerned leaders.\n\n00:19:37,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n To come together and address these kinds of issues. So one of the things we did was we ran a survey pretty soon after news broke about chaos at the FDA when you know, it had only been going on for about a week. So you wouldn't have expected to find many companies having problems. And we ran the survey and we asked people to explicitly. explicitly indicate, have you had recent interactions with the FDA? Most people hadn't. So the fact that they would say, 'I haven't had a problem with the FDA,' it's like, 'well, yeah, if you talked to him three months ago, you know, you wouldn't have.' So you had to specifically look at the ones that had very recent interactions with the FDA.","char_start":15652,"char_end":19099,"start_time":"00:17:05","end_time":null}

So you had to specifically look at the ones that had very recent interactions with the FDA.\n\n00:20:15,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n What we saw was actually many of those did seem fine. They said, 'What was different was we now have a room full of people on that Zoom call, like they're all there in person, and they were all, you know, eager to, you know, help us and and answer our questions and things like that.' But when you then talk to them, it's like, and did that strike you as normal? It's like a few of them said, 'Well, it kind of felt like they were doing everything in their power to say, we can handle this, you know, like, we can muck our way through it, right?' But it didn't seem like they were relaxed, right? And so it's admirable the staff were coming together and doing their absolute best to hold it together, and to these companies, like, 'We're still here, we can still do our jobs.' Now, some of them said, 'Well, it wasn't something that the reviewer could handle.' We needed an issue that required a senior person to resolve it, and they just canceled the meeting. You know, and when we asked the person, 'Why'd you cancel a meeting?' We don't think we can schedule with anybody that can answer this question.'\n\n00:21:18,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n So exactly the kind of thing that you would be afraid would happen if you let a bunch of the senior people go or push them out was in fact happening to some companies. If you look at this purely from a percentage standpoint, it was a very small percent of all companies. When you looked at it as a percentage of the ones that had recent interactions, I think it ended up being about uh 25 of the people that had recent interactions reported problems and that was just you know a week or 10 days or something into this this crisis um and so uh we put those examples into you know a letter um so I I've been talking to Senator Cassidy about this. You know, he is a lead person overseeing healthcare on the Senate Health Committee. And so he said, 'I need specific examples. I need to know what exactly is going on. Don't just tell me that things are scary.\n\n00:22:19,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n Tell me how they're actually going wrong. And then make sure you put it out publicly. Like, I need a tool that's out there that I can share with others. And so we did. We put these examples in. We went further and we asked people within the FDA who were still there, what would be solutions to help stabilize things? We, you know, put solutions into the letter.' And then we put it out for a bunch of signatures. Tons of people signed on, but you know, God bless everybody who who's willing to uh sign one of these letters. You know, every signature helps. And then we got that to Senator Cassidy and the media picked it up. And there was interest from journalists to speak with some of these people. And they were willing to. At the very least, speak off the record. I think there were one or two people that were willing to speak on the record, which is brave. Everybody's worried about being targeted. That, by the way, is a hallmark of tyranny when people are afraid to speak up— that's not okay. That people are afraid to speak up, but some people were courageous enough to speak up even on the record, right?\n\n00:23:23,223 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's how you push back against this. It was heartening to see that it's possible to roll back what appears to be the harm. Now you saw the same thing play out on tariffs, right? I saw, for example, Dave Ricks doing the hard work of speaking with the president and making the case for why tariffs would be harmful. That appears to have bought time, right? That's not a solution, right? We need a fundamental solution to international drug price disparities and either get America to realize, like, you're not subsidizing innovation for the rest of the world.","char_start":18799,"char_end":22848,"start_time":"00:20:15","end_time":null}

We need a fundamental solution to international drug price disparities and either get America to realize, like, you're not subsidizing innovation for the rest of the world.\n\n00:24:06,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're paying for innovation for yourselves. You don't really care about anybody else out there. And to the extent that those other countries are paying anything at all for drugs, treat it like a subsidy of America getting what America wants. Like, that would be a really mature way to look at it. But human beings can't stand the idea of somebody getting a better bargain. And that sense of unfairness keeps creeping up and is causing us to commit self-harm. And so maybe we do need to find a way to get those other countries to pay more. I don't know what that answer is. Maybe tariffs play a role in that. But it's not going to be as simple as binding the industry's hands and forcing them to charge one price everywhere. So we bought ourselves some time.\n\n00:24:50,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n If tariffs do set in, most companies are right. U. S.-based companies, drug development companies do not play the kinds of tax optimization games that multinational pharmaceuticals do. So our companies tend to have their IP in the U. S. A lot of them. Even have their manufacturing in the U. S. If they manufacture overseas, it's probably still in Europe, where in this whole trade war, the tariffs are at least lower rather than in China. Right. And, and then, because the IPs in the US, they transfer the product over from their European facility if they make it abroad at still a low price to the US. So the markup on their cogs is not going to be huge. If you're a multinational and you've stashed your IP in Ireland and you're making your drug in Europe or whatever like, then yeah, you know, you're trying to minimize taxes in the US and so you're going to have a massive tariff on your transfer price that would be a bigger problem. So for a lot of our companies, tariffs are not that big a deal.\n\n00:25:56,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n But that doesn't mean that they aren't a total waste.\n\n00:26:01,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n For our industry and that we're not going to end up taking a hit somewhere, you know, in the NPVs, you know, the cost of acquisitions or the rewards, you know, from acquisitions. There's a price to pay. So I think a lot of people want to say, 'Hey, I'll survive this.' And so they downplay this. But you don't need people just telling you like how they feel about it. You can do the math and you can see for yourself. There's a quantitative impact from this stuff. So we try to shine a light on that and help people make their own decisions.\n\n00:26:32,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's a great segue into tariffs. I know, Sam, you're going to have some views on tariffs. Give you just to—but actually, before we leave the whole FDA thing, I just want to say. Well, first, thank you and no patient left behind for. for it. being willing to step out there and being visible and trying to rally the community. I'm sure you took some heat as well as some praise for doing it. But it's critical that others do the same. Like myself was in, I mentioned in DC this past week. To me, the comment you made about tyranny is not just appropriate to uh you know tyranny but there's fear of speaking out is not just corporate tyranny it's also appropriate to politics unfortunately I found that some of our elected leaders were fearful of speaking out for fear of repercussion. And that's not something we can have either in a functioning democracy. So the more we do speak out, the more we support the truth, what's right.\n\n00:27:32,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Our own views, the more we talk to our elected leaders.\n\n00:27:36,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n More power we give them to to act appropriately, and I certainly hope that no patient left behind is going to tip the scales in the favor of justice and science. But um, you know, we could all be hopeful. Go ahead, Sam. I just wanted to say that.\n\n00:27:49,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I just wanted a clarifying thing for and from Peter. The people I spoke to were all large pharma. So my assumption was that at any given time, there must have quite a lot of interactions with the regulators across the globe.

So my assumption was that at any given time, there must have quite a lot of interactions with the regulators across the globe. Were you focused entirely on the violence? Tech ecosystem, yes.\n\n00:28:10,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n We surveyed a small number of companies. At first, I only surveyed my portfolio companies that you know— everywhere we sit on the board. We're already under CDA, and they would be more forthcoming. Then somebody blasted out the survey to everybody. And so we got a lot more input from a lot more companies. And I have no visibility into what big pharma is, but I would imagine that they're going to be the last ones to admit that they've got problems anywhere.\n\n00:28:43,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, that's what I was saying. And actually, if you listen to the Q1, they'll repeat the same comment. Our interactions are fine. And then onto the tariffs, if you wanted to, Eric, for me just to carry. I mean, it's the same, pretty much the biggest number I've seen out there. Some companies didn't disclose what their tariff impact is. Novartis, for example, they said it's not meaningful enough for us to do it. And I think the largest number I saw was actually Johnson & Johnson. comes from the medical device side mostly and it's mostly due to their interactions with China, so but that was the biggest number I saw. And frankly, those kinds of hundreds of millions of dollars are absorbable within the system. Um, and then, in general, I think most companies will say, 'Look, obviously, this is not the right way to deal with it.' The right way to deal with it is to help us lower taxes in the US so we don't have to go and play these.\n\n00:29:38,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, transfer price games. That we do if you want to call it the game. I think most of them said that in terms of international reference pricing. Of course, nobody really likes it because you can't force European nations or ex-US nations to raise their prices. Don't forget, folks, at the same time, Europe's going to have to be dealing with increasing their defense budget, which is the right thing to do. But you can't, unless they all start printing money, they can't just go and raise their, I think on average, it's about 7% of GDP spent on prescription drugs, which in the US is far higher than that, and it should be higher in Europe. It's not just about the matter of price.\n\n00:30:18,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n not GDP, of healthcare spending.\n\n00:30:20,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of healthcare spending. Sorry, you're right. It's like closer to one. That would be crazy. Absolutely right. That would be fantastic if it was the right number. Well done. Thank you, Peter. And then, of course, the other issue is the speed with which or time that it takes to get product to market. and even not getting approval or not getting the any of the health technology assessments, allowing a drug that's clearly positive to be approved and used. So those are the other issues that certainly Europe needs to deal with. And then one last thing I wanted to say, I'm not 100% sure that I trust the numbers that some of the companies, I'm not saying they're lying or covering anything up, but 20 billion, 30 billion, 50 billion here and there in terms of commitments we're going to be spending in the US over the next four or five years. I think some of them almost certainly include the standard maintenance CapEx that they were going to be using or their standard R &D. We need to look at what the number, I think the best measure for me is the number of jobs that they're suggesting they're going to add.\n\n00:31:23,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that's not been massive numbers.\n\n00:31:28,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, so maybe there is some light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to tariffs and an improving outlook. Um, Adam, coming back to you, you had already flagged in your tweet the strong launches that biotech is experiencing. This is the lightblood of our industry. Anything in particular that you saw?

In the first quarter that you want to call out.\n\n00:31:47,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, probably the, you know, like you said, Eric, it's a kind of more of a continuation of a trend, right? This um, you know, probably the most attention in the last week was probably on British bio. And the, you know. Q1 for Truby, which you know they did it was very strong, they posted a really great number, uh. Which, you know, bodes well and, you know, sort of. confirmed what a lot of people had thought that, you know, there were. a relatively large number of patients who are undiagnosed or untreated in that patient population than that. It looks like that could be a much more expansive market than had previously been thought. Um. So, I mean, I think, you know, just continue. So, you know, Magical obviously put up a pretty good number, too. You know, there's always been a lot of question marks about the mash market as it pertains to. these drugs and and and glp-1s and you know how those things compete so you know, those are all i mean i'd rather have i'd rather see strong drug launches than you know than a bunch of earnings reports where we see a lot of misses, right?\n\n00:32:47,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n So it just sort of, you know, collectively, I think it. It bodes well.\n\n00:32:53,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Did you get a chance to listen in to the El Nilem call? I know our team thought that they were a little bit less transparent on what was happening.\n\n00:33:01,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n I did not. I did not get a chance. And it's interesting you say that, but I have also heard the same and picked up on that.\n\n00:33:10,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n I guess I could sort of, I don't know. I was going to save something for next week, but I guess I'll share it here because I love you guys. I did ask them after the call specifically because I think it came up about how they're going to report out Ambutra sales going forward. And I think a lot of people were hoping or expecting to see them. Parse the number by the indication you know by, um, polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy and I was told yesterday that they were not going to do that, that the plan right now is to just report and group the sales in totality and not break out by indication, which obviously is there. Right. And I think obviously a lot of companies with drugs with multiple indications, that's what they do. You know, this case maybe is a little bit different because you have this direct competitor competing in the CM side. And people want to be able to compare Amvutro versus Atruby going forward. But at least for now, that's not going to at least be possible from a reporting standpoint.\n\n00:34:17,679 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, our team picked up the same thing. Olivia Breyer is our analyst on Alnylam, and she also let us know that they weren't able to break that out. It's a little bit tricky, right? Not too many companies have the confidence in where their sales are coming from, indication by indication, in order to provide those numbers to Wall Street. But Olivia also felt that Alnylam on the margin was being, maybe, a little bit less than forthcoming with other launch metrics. Potentially. She would have liked to hear, especially given, as you mentioned Adam, how how vocal Bridge Bio has been with regard to reimbursement and patient numbers and uptake. I mean, you would really think that that Alnylam would have some of those benchmarks.\n\n00:35:03,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, no, I agree. It's an interesting it is an interesting situation. I mean, as a reporter, I love it. Right. Because you got these two companies competing head to head and you can sort of compare the numbers. And then, when one company is being sort of less transparent and one company is being more transparent, it just creates that, you know. Okay.\n\n00:35:22,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, I wonder, I do wonder.","char_start":30463,"char_end":34545,"start_time":"00:31:47","end_time":null}

I did mention to them. I thought it was a little odd that they wouldn't. They wouldn't parse out those numbers that way. And so they may, like, who knows, right? They have three months. You know we're not gonna— we're not— we can, you know, we can all revisit this in three months to see what how Nylem ends up doing. But that was noteworthy to me when I heard back from them yesterday.\n\n00:35:53,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, I know that Adam mentioned some successful product introductions and some favorable earnings reports. I think Verona probably also falls into the same bag as a Bridge Bio or a Madrigal. Are a few other mid-caps that are having terrific early product introductions.\n\n00:36:11,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n But I think you wanted to pick up on a couple of. of losers from the Q1 earnings period as well.\n\n00:36:17,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, losers— nobody ever likes to label a company as a loser, but I know exactly what you mean. And let's just perhaps talk about Regeneron and maybe Moderna quickly. Regeneron, obviously, just had their One cue and, you know, they came in 7% below consensus. It's one that one of my colleagues, Andrew Galler, covers. And EPS, okay, missed. only by about 2%, but that was due to expense management, which is the right thing for companies to do. So I lay off this by 11%, which is an issue. And then it has a whole range of things that is— dealing with which is the competitive pressure, inventory, write downs, and this reduced funding for copay foundations. Which also um, I think Rosch spoke about, and some of it's because of the increased use of compounded, the vastness. So this turned out it turned out to be not a good reporting period for these guys.\n\n00:37:18,190 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then of course, on top of that, they had a They called out a Another CRL.\n\n00:37:25,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n for pre-filled syringe this time for Eylea and that's There was no real clarity on how that might get resolved. So not a good Q1 for Regeneron. They do have some pretty hefty pipeline news coming for the rest of the year. So let's see how that all pans out. One thing is not exactly their drug, but Lilly got data coming at ADA for their for their Bimagrimab combination with semaglutide. And of course, they've got an equivalent type of product. And let's see if Lily can show us preservation of muscle mass. And then, of course, they've got their LAG-3 that they believe is differentiated, reporting in the second half in the first line.\n\n00:38:12,009 [SPEAKER_0]\n melanoma trial. And then Moderna had a had a had a not as bad a day but a but a tough day in that they i think they've looked at the issues, the risks facing vaccines, aside from general vaccine hesitancy that's been going around. But what if what Peter was talking about becomes a reality? They can't get COVID.\n\n00:38:37,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, updated shots approved in any possible world, it's you're not going to be able to do a procedure just a controlled trial ahead of their season. And so they've now guided to 2027 OPEX, which is meaningfully below what consensus had. And according to our numbers, it saved them from going cash negative in 27 or 28, depending on revenue. But that still needs a couple of billion dollars of revenue top line.\n\n00:39:04,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, and and I think a lot of that, as with with the delay also in their flu combo, um Kobe the vaccine, um it was a bit of a drag for those guys too. So and you see them now becoming more of a cancer story. So that was the two I thought were worth mentioning.\n\n00:39:22,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n want to um can i can i add to that ask sam a question and maybe also you eric just When it comes to Moderna and the mRNA platform technology, it just— I mean, there's so much There's so much hostility.\n\n00:39:36,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't know how else to describe it against mRNA.

Like, what do you guys think about the future, like right now, the future of anything mRNA related? vaccines or drugs.\n\n00:40:04,529 [SPEAKER_0]\n Eric, do you want to comment? I'm happy to comment.\n\n00:40:06,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n Please, Sam.\n\n00:40:08,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, look, at the end of the day, in an oncology setting, I think there was some earlier comments way at the beginning of the 100 days where there was a positive, I can't remember who it was— now, it was Larry Ellison— even, which of course is not in the administration, but I'm assuming is a friend and still is a friend of the administration, talking about mRNA vaccines and how amazing they are. And in fact, I think Moderna still has moved on that.\n\n00:40:34,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n This is a therapeutic. It's a very different story, I think. If they can get them to work, and frankly, and it's another topic that we'll talk about, PD-1 VEGF, most of the physicians you speak to are all say the same thing. Show me, show me the data. It's interesting. They all want it to work because it opens a whole new therapeutic. um or or preventative whatever way you want to talk about it as a peri-adjuvant trial setting.\n\n00:41:04,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n But show me, show me, and we could analyze, as we might do for the PD-L1, VEGFs, every single bit of data. But the proof will be in the clinical data that reads up.\n\n00:41:19,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n I hope that answers your question.\n\n00:41:22,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n I just want to agree with you, Adam. I mean, unfortunately, we live in this world where mRNA has been indicted. war. poorly scientific reasons, right? As I mentioned, I was down in Washington, D. C., and one of the congressmen we met with was citing some report he had read that mRNA can alter your genome. Right and put aside the fact that he wasn't quite sure and didn't have the scientific background to know.\n\n00:41:47,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n But the fact that this stuff is out there and reverberating in our echo chambers and causing this. level of Uh oh. The focus and inspection onto mRNA technologies is just a shame and we need to do better from the scientific literacy standpoint to counteract that because otherwise we're going to miss out on some good drugs. Go ahead, Peter.\n\n00:42:10,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n I was going to say that mRNA can alter your genome if you want it to. It can do a lot of really cool things. And this whole thing with mRNA, it reminded me of— of hormone replacement therapy, right? We talked ourselves out of the merits of hormone replacement therapy for millions of women. Who would have benefited from it, because of a misread of a study way back when, this happens right this happens routinely in and medicine. And the facts, they don't just stand for themselves. There's this uncertainty variable that you apply to the facts, based on how the public will you know want to receive it. And so, if you don't have—oh, good PR strategy. And I don't say that in a way where I know what that is.\n\n00:43:11,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm saying we, as an industry, need to learn how to convey facts, in order for them to. Be heard in the way they're supposed to, the public can easily talk itself out of something really beneficial. And so, something along the way, you know, with mRNA vaccines, on the one hand, they saved the world, restored normalcy, trillions of dollars of economic activity. On the other hand, those myocarditis signals prompted some people, probably people who are already in the anti-vaxxer world. You know to go and search for anything they could find that would sow doubt, and they did, and they found it there. Right, you know, um, oh, myocarditis. Well, yeah, leave aside the fact, I guess, that the virus itself causes way higher rates of myocarditis and a lot more harm. And so, in the end, because we continue as an industry to assume that our work will speak for itself, right, we continue to discover that the public has ways of taking a left turn and denying itself the benefits of what we do.","char_start":38336,"char_end":42772,"start_time":"00:39:36","end_time":null}

And I don't think that we're going to solve how to message about vaccines or mRNA. But we do have to figure out how, as an industry, we're going to iterate on the marketing communications messages with all these different pockets of the public and ultimately keep them.\n\n00:44:46,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n As much as they can be fans of what we're doing and receptive to the good that we're creating and able to take the side effects, the risks in stride, right? Like the car industry has plenty of negatives to it.\n\n00:45:03,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n But people don't hate on the car industry, right? They choose not to. They choose to ignore the car accidents. They choose to ignore when some company has some emissions scandal. Whatever, they just brush that off, right? Oh, the autopilot, you know, screwed up, killed some people, like, I'm still gonna drive, right? I'm gonna buy that exact same car, right? So like, The public is capable of dismissing bad news if it wants to. We've got to do the R&D to figure out how do you ultimately bridge to the public and get them to believe in us, believe in the credibility of the work that we do. So that when these kinds of side effects come up, they're not used to completely dismantle you know, an entire scientific trend. So you know, cancer vaccines are uh yet to be proven. In my view, there's promising hints, but the most powerful use of this mRNA was and remains in the prophylactic vaccine for infectious disease and particularly for pandemics. It's the fastest response that we've got to this.\n\n00:46:07,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I really hope that the country continues to maintain its mRNA armamentarium.\n\n00:46:15,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n Actually, Peter, one thing that's just occurred to me, this could be one of the examples: if the U. S. steps away from wanting to approve and accept mRNA vaccines, guess what? The rest of the world will pay the price for that too, which is exactly to the point that innovation happens there. It's rewarded there. If the reward's taken away, everybody suffers, not just the US. So it would be a perfect study and proof of this to the European countries.\n\n00:46:45,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, they know it. I talked to a guy at NICE once.\n\n00:46:51,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n This was years ago when I just first started looking into cost-effectiveness math. Like, hey, did you know that when you guys do your math, you're only looking at the price of the drug when it launches? And what I realized is that if you extend your model, you know, decades out and look at the long-term value of the drug, it actually goes generic after like, you know, 14 years. And yet you get all this benefit. It shows that these drugs actually have a cost-effectiveness ratio that's like that's three times more favorable than you calculate. Here I am, like, I was younger than I'll call myself a kid. And he was like, oh, yeah, we know that. That's called dynamic pricing. I'm like, well, why don't you do it? He's like, well. Then it would make drugs look more cost-effective, and you know we wouldn't have an excuse not to not to pay for them. You know, I'm like, 'Holy crap, that's insidious.' And I realized, like, they know exactly what they're doing. I'm like, 'But if the US were to adopt your math, it would stop paying for these medicines too. And you would end up, you know, going without.' He's like, 'Yeah, we know that we do this so that we pay, you know, low prices.'\n\n00:47:52,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n We definitely hope the US doesn't adopt our math. They're fully conscious of what they're doing.\n\n00:48:01,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n I feel like that's a whole other discussion for a whole other day, but scary nonetheless. Thanks, guys, for sharing on the mRNA topic. Maybe just to keep the discussion moving, Sam, there was one other. company that took it on the chin this week. Lilly probably had the most downside, at least in terms of market cap.\n\n00:48:19,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Quickly discuss what the issues were there.\n\n00:48:22,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah.","char_start":42472,"char_end":46880,"start_time":"00:44:18","end_time":null}

It was a double whammy. They had their results, which of course they had an 8% EPS beat, but they didn't raise. Which is what I think the market didn't like. When you're sitting at those kind of valuations, 40x or whatever the number is, depending on which day you're looking at it, the market's very unforgiving. And of course, what then happened was at the same time, this news about CVS, one of the bigger pharmacy chains. In the U. S. or formularies, we go v over as a single a product and its formularies versus Z bound, which is an interesting move because Nova dropped their price to whatever it is, $499 a month. And then he then explained that this is not the whole of CVS. This is certain parts of it which don't really make a difference for us.\n\n00:49:24,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n And we are not going to go into this price fight because we've seen it happen before with insulins. We've seen it happen before with GLP-1s for diabetes.\n\n00:49:36,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n That's what happened to them. And they got, you know, I think at one point it was down 12%, which was shocking to me in terms of the— billions of dollars that was taken up the value.\n\n00:49:47,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n And of course, there are continuing worries that people have: Is this market as big as everybody thinks? We're going to stick with our view that in the long term, it is. But I think for the real big market to come, you do need these price drops and maybe some of the orals and maybe some of these to go generic at some point.\n\n00:50:10,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you for that clarity. Another name that's been kind of all over the place is Summit and their partner, Akesso in China. Sam, again, I know you've been following the I've been asking about story closely. This is the. VEGF PD-1bis specific for oncology. I think at one point last. Friday summit was down about. 30, almost 40%.\n\n00:50:35,640 [SPEAKER_3]\n It's pulled back. It's actually quite strong today.\n\n00:50:39,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n This weakness, of course, came on the heels of the Harmony 2. updated data set which provided our first very very early look at survival. um do you have thoughts I can cover it however you want to do it um maybe one want to One of us can give the top line results.\n\n00:50:55,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Go ahead. And I'd love to hear your view as to. Whether you would even, if it comes back at the hazard ratio that we've seen, whether you think it'd be clinically meaningful— I mean, just to recap, this drug is going head to head versus PD-1 therapy.\n\n00:51:10,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n We all know the PD-1s are a $50 billion plus market growing at a very, very healthy clip. Ivan Escamab has huge potential, and that probably explains the volatility or the big swings in some of the Anakeso shares.\n\n00:51:23,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n What we learned last Friday late in the day, unfortunately, was that the hazard ratio at a very preliminary look for survival was 0. 777. And at least in my discussions with investors, folks were looking for a moderately lower hazard ratio, better overall survival at this early juncture, maybe something more like 0.75. So again, that triggered a fairly meaningful correction in a stock that had been very strong on another data set earlier in the week. And to your question, Sam, you know, is . 77 an acceptable final? Overall survival, assuming the study matures in the same uh direction, yes, I think it absolutely is. I think if you anytime you you take on the world's largest drug today, which is Pembro, and you beat it head to head, and you have the survival result that is not just clinically meaningful, but would also likely be statistically meaningful at that point. That'd be a huge win. So I think there's still fear right now in the marketplace about how the survival result will mature— whether it will in fact be 0.\n\n00:52:30,165 [SPEAKER_3]\n 777 at the end of the study. And also fear about how these data will translate into the US setting, which we could talk about.

And also fear about how these data will translate into the US setting, which we could talk about. But I'd love to get your views.\n\n00:52:39,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so I'll just add a couple of things. The things that I would love to know before I actually. With my um, you know, if I could put my money to work, um, is the the the split by PD1, PD-L1 expression, because in this trial, they had Keytruda alone, and it included patients below 49%, where you're supposed to have Keytruda plus chemo. Now, we know that that's not necessarily standard care in China. So the risk for me is, whenever we see that data split, that most of the efficacy. We know that's not the case for the PFS, right? But most of the EOS benefit is coming in that population. That's what I'd love to see. Why would that be the case? I don't know. I can't think of a biological reason why the PFS wouldn't translate to equal benefit for the high expressors and low expressors.\n\n00:53:34,109 [SPEAKER_0]\n Just to be able to sleep at night, that's what I would like to see.\n\n00:53:39,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then of course, yeah, go on. Go ahead, please.\n\n00:53:43,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n I was going to ask you about the next trial, but go ahead.\n\n00:53:46,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, exactly. By the middle of the year, we are supposed to hear about harmony. Now, harmony is in second line. GFR. So you've had your Tigriso most of the time, and you now need a follow-on treatment.\n\n00:54:01,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n So that trial has been conducted. In the US, it's pretty much a carbon copy of the trial that has led to an approval in China called Harmony A. We look at those numbers and the way I'm looking at it. Is, is this going to be able to beat the kind of things that are current in the US, which is a Mariposa 2, so Johnson & Johnson's River Valley plus Las Clos. or Ribraman plus chemo, which should have three arms in it. And frankly, from a ORR, PFS, disease control rate, et cetera, numbers, it looks similar.\n\n00:54:35,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n So that would be fine. That's competitive. But what is definitely more interesting is that the discontinuation rates and the toxicity seem to be in favor of this drug, of the Ivanisamab.\n\n00:54:52,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n If it replicates Harmony A, and this is going to be the first time that we're going to compare an ex-China trial with a China trial, and therefore I think middle of this year is going to be the one of the key data points for this class.\n\n00:55:07,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n I do agree.\n\n00:55:09,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Agree 100 on that. I mean, it's not so much that this second line, egfr-positive lung cancer population, is that larger market. It's not— it's quite small and, as you noted, it's quite competitive. But the three data sets that we have seen thus far all do come from China. They all suggest that Ivan Escamab is differentiated and superior in its properties. Say PD-1 therapy. And yet we have nothing in the US to substantiate that. So, if Harmony does replicate the Harmony A trial, which was conducted in China, I do think that's it. A very important milestone for investors in terms of de-risking. We also had a bunch of other data sets, and I know we're not going to have enough time to capture all of them. Sam, I think you were at both AUA and ACR this week.\n\n00:55:53,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't know if there's call out or two that you want to make that was particularly intriguing, perhaps at AUA?\n\n00:56:01,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Very quick— for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, there is great options coming up. CG oncologist data looks good. um tar 200 from um from johnson johnson looks good, they're both the sorts of things that uh that you would say urologists could use. you don't have to go necessarily to a to a an oncologist. um and we also saw some data from um Pfizer, Sasandamab, which is their subcutaneous PD-1, that looked good. So there's some hopes that bladder cancer is going to see some more much better. improvements in the next few months, years, in terms of approvals on the back of what we've already seen with EV Pembro for muscle-invasive, but static disease. And from AACR, so much, so many data points.

They've been at it for a long time. This is the same group that gave the- the world, Lynn Parza, under the guise of QDOS, which AstraZeneca acquired. And this data set actually looks very good.

We've only got another minute or so left here. Maybe Adam, I'll come back to you. And. Give you the last word. Are we going to see the XBI up for a fourth straight week next week? Are you truly optimistic or you just want it to be less of a curmudgeon?\n\n00:57:50,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n Eric, you want me to predict that? Come on, man. You don't want me to do that. I don't. Who knows? Who knows? You know, it's just good, you know, after talking to so many people. For a good two months or more. It was just every conversation I would have with investors. Uh, was. Just so depressing. And I'm sure, you know, you've had— I know you had the same conversations with people. And it was. You know, just like you get out the phone and you're like, 'Oh.'\n\n00:58:17,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, so it's good to see, you know, a little bit of a turn and stabilization. So, you know, yeah, let's hope for, let's hope for another good week. We can end it there. On an optimistic note, for me, for all people.\n\n00:58:33,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I'm looking at sunshine in New York City. We've got the weekend ahead. It's Friday afternoon.

I'm Grace Colon, and my co-hosts today are Josh Schimmer, Eric Schmidt, Sam Fazelli. Yaron Werber, and Tess Cameron. For more information about our hosts or guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episodes, please go to biotechhangout. com. So we have a lot to cover as usual, and we're going to go around the group to comment on some of the policy issues that are really top of mind for everyone in the industry and creating a lot of uncertainty and volatility.\n\n00:00:34,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n There was some interest to talk about Celtus and Nyx, but we'll save that for the end if there's any time. There's quite a bit of trash talking going around in our group. Before we get to the impact of policy moves, just as a reminder, setting some context, I'm sure everybody knows the XBI was down. Over 20% at one point in April, year-to-date, treating under 70. $70 or so, but bouncing back up with the early cautious optimism. About new FDA Commissioner McCary's comments around expediting preclinical and clinical drug development, accelerated approvals, especially for rare diseases. Even as of last week. Then this week, we had a number of things go on. So on May 6th, the decision to appoint Vinay Prasad as the next director of CBER, previously headed by Peter's Marks, drove the XBI down by 7% in the first day of the announcement. And as of this morning, it's nearly down for the year, about 14%.\n\n00:01:32,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n Prasad, I think everybody knows his background by now, hematologist, oncologist, UCSF professor, also an author and social media influencer who's been sharply critical of the agency and the pharmaceutical industry, particularly around COVID issues. Initially, his appointment created quite a bit of uncertainty and concern, particularly around things like vaccine and gene therapy, based on some comments he had made about, for example, Sarepta's products. use of surrogate endpoints. Particularly accelerated approval pathway in oncology, where he cited low overall survival statistics for new drugs approved. However, it's interesting. A lot of reporting came out yesterday about his first speech to staff on Wednesday, where he really struck a more conciliatory, open tone that was just a bit more humble, open to. And reconsidering his prior comments about randomized controlled trials, you know, always being necessary. So that I think people were very pleasantly surprised by that.\n\n00:02:34,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n It sounds like the staff, you know, really received his opening comments really well.\n\n00:02:40,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Then on Wednesday, we also saw that President Trump pulled the nomination of his prior nominee, Jeanette Nashua, a Fox contributor, be Surgeon General. and then appointed Casey Means, a physician with close ties to the Make America Healthy Again movement. And Means is a Stanford trained physician, didn't quite finish her residency, and then pivoted into functional medicine. and founded the Glucose Monitoring Consumer Health Company Levels. She also does not have an active medical license and is a proponent of things like raw milk and a number of other things that the Maha movement is supported of. So that's the context of some things that happened this week. Let's go around the room and get some comments about these appointments. I know, Tess, you had some thoughts specifically on Sarepta related to this, but let's talk about the overall. Um, comments on these appointments and then we can dive into this erupta news.

So Tess, why don't you start?\n\n00:03:39,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, maybe just adding a couple things to what you said, because I think, same general, you know. We saw it in the stocks, right? You know, the reaction that investor has, which was like. Wow. And what I thought was interesting is it wasn't just CBIR stocks that were down, right? Which is going to be Vinay Prasad's, you know, primary role is really seabirds. So we saw Sarepta, Unicure, Capricorn, Tayshia. It was also accelerated approval stocks that aren't within CBER's purview. But, you know, I think that relates to the comments that you cited, Grace. You know, I note that, you know, there were also a number of comments that he'd made previously just around the value of medicines to the point where. You know, when I would kind of look at those tweets, it's like, OK, you know, here's a clearly very smart man. Like, does he care about the hard work that so many people in our ecosystem are doing to develop innovative drugs? And similar to you, I was very encouraged by his, you know, commentary, you know, also at the interview that him and McCary held yesterday.\n\n00:04:45,810 [SPEAKER_4]\n That were very encouraging, where he did reiterate his appreciation for the value of innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives that forward. Uh, you know, rare diseases and emphasis on flexibility emphasizing the really hard work that the FDA does and the quality of the people who the FDA has recruited, which is really, really important. I mean, these are incredibly smart people doing very important work. Um, vaccines—I don't know, right. Like, we'll have to see. Uh, you know, what unfolds there. I think, you know, he, you know, shared that he plans to be very data-oriented and like we will— we will have to see— being data-oriented can include. Reasonable things and can also include, you know, some things that you know, can you know, perhaps be pretty unreasonable or just make it really difficult for vaccines to be commercialized. I'm curious in what others are thinking. I think we've heard very positive things from the FDA. You know, so far.\n\n00:05:46,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, I'm still very much in wait and see mode to, you know, actually, you know, get a few more approvals through. It was certainly, you know, reassuring to see the Veristem accelerated approval. The next day, it was like, okay, things are still functioning. The accelerated approval pathway is perhaps still open, but I think we're going to have to see more of that and see more. You know, great things like the AI. drug review. I mean, talk about like a fantastic application for AI.\n\n00:06:20,480 [SPEAKER_4]\n So, you know, hopefully in the next couple of months, we really start to see. You know, some of these words. Turn into action and get a little more certainty around how the FDA is going to behave.\n\n00:06:36,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n Great. No, fantastic additions. Sam, do you want to comment next?\n\n00:06:40,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sure. So I've been following Vinay Prasad for a while from a multiple myeloma perspective.\n\n00:06:49,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because obviously he's a mythologist and he has lots of views and lots of ideas.\n\n00:06:55,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n Very interesting to listen to. So the whole thing will end up being words are fine. What we need to see is what the actions are. So let me just give you an example of— excuse me— one of the things that he's um.\n\n00:07:10,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Been opposed to. And I'm not taking sides here, whether that's right or wrong, but the FDA has recently said that a minimal or measurable residual disease can be an endpoint for filing. And some companies have, for instance, Arcelix, just very recently said, or Gilead said, that they'd moved one of their trials to have MRD as a um— as an endpoint because to fit with what the FDA had said. So.","char_start":3396,"char_end":7517,"start_time":"00:03:39","end_time":null}

So.\n\n00:07:35,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n But Dr. Prasad is very against this. He thinks that it's not the right way to go forward. You're bringing a drug in that you don't know the absolute clinical benefit of. And he has some very solid arguments to support his view, which are openly available to listen to. What's going to happen now is, I'm very super interested, and I'm sure everybody who covers our CELICs in Gilead is— Is that going to result in CBER saying, because CAR Ts are under the CBER banner, that endpoint is not acceptable anymore? And therefore, companies have to change their endpoints, in which case it makes some clinical trials extremely long to do. In terms relative to just measuring MRD, which is a lot faster. And let me give you another wrinkle of this. If that ends up being the case, then if companies go to Cedar with a bispecific antibody, that looks at MRD, do they end up getting the same rule or do they continue to have under Cedar an acceptance of MRD as an endpoint?\n\n00:08:37,669 [SPEAKER_0]\n So these are things that it's just nice to know how they evolve. And of course, it creates uncertainty. Nobody likes uncertainty in the investment world. On the vaccine side, very quickly.\n\n00:08:49,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, on the 29th of April, there was commentary made that Dr. Prasad was in favor of the idea of doing COVID-19 boosters following randomized trials measuring clinical endpoints. Now, I recall that when we do Flu vaccines, they're not clinical endpoints. They are antigenicity or immunogenicity studies. That's not a clinical endpoint, right? And perhaps by the time you do the flu, you've got some evidence of efficacy in the southern hemisphere. If that's acceptable for COVID shots, then good. The only thing is that currently COVID evolves much more quickly than flu has been. You get the strain in the south and you use that for the north. For COVID, we don't know what's going on, right? Is it possible to actually do a randomized trial?\n\n00:09:43,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Getting data from populations in the southern hemisphere is fine. But to do a randomized trial, organize it, set it up, by the time you've done it, your strain would have changed. So we end up in a situation where I don't see how these companies are going to be able to do that for boosters. And let's see if that remains a view that Dr. Prasad has. And it's obviously as of 29th of April, so only a few days ago. So again, uncertainty. And of course, the FDA will set the rules and people have to follow it.\n\n00:10:18,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, those are great points, particularly around the nature of sort of seasonal strains and obviously pandemic strains as well. I mean, I ran the Tamiflu Alliance between Gilead and Roche way back when, and we did. All this pandemic planning around influenza, never thinking Corona was going to be an issue. So, I mean, it's just going to be compounding, right? So I think that those are some of the real fears here and also with cutbacks in public health. Not only in the U. S., but our support globally is very, very concerning. I agree with you. And it'd be good to get some clarity on that.\n\n00:10:52,750 [SPEAKER_7]\n Josh, you want to go next?\n\n00:10:58,690 [SPEAKER_7]\n Oops, I think you're on mute.\n\n00:11:05,460 [SPEAKER_7]\n Okay, maybe we're having issues here.\n\n00:11:07,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Eric, you want to go next?\n\n00:11:10,730 [SPEAKER_5]\n Well, I'll give it a shot.

Thank you. Grace. Thanks. Thanks all, pleasure. As always, to be with everyone today.\n\n00:11:16,870 [SPEAKER_5]\n Maybe three quick things on this appointment. Number one, nobody should be surprised by it, right? We've seen this organization— whether it's Trump appointing Casey Means to Surgeon General or Macari appointing. Aprasad to to siever head uh this is all maha this is all rfk jr this is new regime so i know the markets took it on the chin as you mentioned grace but really, we should by now all see this coming. Number two, my question is which. Which Vinay Prasad is going to show up to work at CBER? Will it be the internet? troll the Iconoclast on X, the Maverick, the Contrarian. um the outspoken critic of pretty much anything that's that's accepted measure in society these days? Or will it be the guy we saw, smart, engaging, gentlemanly? who was quoted in some of the articles around his CBER introductory meeting. I hope it's the latter. But it'll be very, very interesting to see which Vinay Prasad we get.\n\n00:12:20,120 [SPEAKER_5]\n And third, I think you have to put Dr. Prasad's appointment in the context of Dr. Macari's leadership of the FDA. Sam, I hear you, and I too am very concerned about some of the comments you specifically made around accelerated approval pathways. But I do take some comfort in the fact that Dr. Macari most recently has been very, very open and engaging and vociferous. Uh, around wanting to speed drug approvals, in fact, there was a press release from the FDA out just this week on uh AI, uh incorporation into the review process, and again, Macari used that as an opportunity. To talk about how we need to accelerate the review process. So when you have a boss in Macquarie, who is setting out that, you know, more. global environment for rapid review processes. I take some comfort and consolation that some of Dr. Prasad's policies maybe won't see the light of day.\n\n00:13:21,710 [SPEAKER_5]\n Let me pause there and maybe Josh, can you hear us?\n\n00:13:24,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, can you hear me now? Yep. All right. Yay. All right. Unfortunately, I missed some of that, but I think I kind of know what you were getting at with them. With Vinay, personally, I'm, you know, Seeing that at least so far we're getting his podcast personality and not his Twitter personality.\n\n00:13:46,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Very excited to see what he's going to do. He is. He is wicked sharp. Um, you know, you kind of see it in his writings and and um his his deeper analyses. He's not gonna let any anyone slip anything by the FDA that is not a good and important therapy for patients. We see from time to time some game playing around drug development to get drugs approved and commercialized, perhaps in ways that are intentionally, perhaps overstating their value to patients. You know, best we can tell. He does not seem to be someone who's going to tolerate that. It seems clear that he's going to raise the bar. At Seabird. I think many of us did feel like that bar had tipped a little too low to be healthy for the industry and for patients for the long term. Now that's always going to be subjective. Peter Marks made very good cases as to why he was okay approving drugs that may not actually in the end of the day be benefiting patients, but he wanted to give them the chance.\n\n00:14:54,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n Now, I'm not sure Vinay is going to be as sympathetic for drugs that haven't really shown a meaningful benefit to patients from what I've read from him. You know, aside from some of the cantankerous comments and inflammatory comments that he'll kind of shoot from his hip at times, that in ways that you kind of wish he didn't, but you know, he really is looking for for those drugs that are adding value for patients in a in a tangible way, and that is what our industry is about, for the most part. You know, I look at The names that I cover and the names that we're following. We generally don't support products that we don't think are going to have an important value for patients.\n\n00:15:37,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n If he's going to set the bar a little bit higher. Alright.\n\n00:15:42,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would like to see what he brings. Hoping that he leaves that Twitter personality at home.\n\n00:15:51,670 [SPEAKER_7]\n Great.

Your own.\n\n00:15:54,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I mean, I think that at the end, what we're going to get, my sense is, we're seeing two different personalities and a little bit two different ideologies against a backdrop of major change coming from Kennedy even. With a goal to expedite at the same time. So I think that it's not going to end up being. A simple package that's going to be. It's not going to be a gift that we're going to know exactly what that that toy does. It's going to have a lot of variability and look. We talked about two different examples. One of them is emerging negativity. And it's probably going to end up being in the context or how validated is that therapeutic, given that some of the other therapeutics in the class have survival data. In COVID vaccines, I think we're beginning to see, also, with Novavax, that things are going to become a little bit more bifurcated. And perhaps, maybe Josh, what you're alluding to— the bar is going to get ratcheted up.\n\n00:16:55,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n With the way they look at things scientifically.\n\n00:16:59,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n And it's not the agency that's going to become less predictable.\n\n00:17:03,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's probably going to make our life a little bit more complicated. But at the end, I also don't believe that we're all going into one direction that's negative. I think there's going to be positives and there's going to be some setbacks. And I'm just hoping that four years from now, there's obviously a lot more positive than not.\n\n00:17:22,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm staying optimistic.\n\n00:17:24,609 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm a little bit more concerned about the overall change at FDA than the change in its specific area.\n\n00:17:32,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n Great. Thank you. Well, why don't we dive into what this means for particular companies? I mean, obviously, this is earnings season. And on top of that, we're having all these other added uncertainties. And so a good example of that is Sarepta. And I know, Tess, you're covering them. Why don't you give us your thoughts on how this is all impacting them and what's going on with the company?\n\n00:17:53,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, so I think Sarepta had things doubly hard that day because, First, there was the news of Vinay Prasad being dominated. He'd really questioned, you know, whether that Elevitas, their gene therapy drug, should have been approved. So, the stock was down 25 percent on his nomination. And then on earnings, it went down even more. So, you know, down another 12% on earnings. That came out that evening. So really, a double whammy. And the earnings. What happened at earnings that evening is, they reduced guidance from $2. 9 to $3. 1 billion for the year to $2. 3 to $2. 6 billion for the year. And I think the first thing everyone probably looked at when they saw that earnings guidance was like, 'oh, my gosh, this is all because of.' You know, this is all because of the really unfortunate patient death. That they shared earlier this year that was a non-ambulatory patient who'd been dosed with the drug.\n\n00:18:54,050 [SPEAKER_4]\n And had a concurrent CMV infection and unfortunately passed away.\n\n00:18:59,510 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, but you know, it turns out it's, it's actually quite a bit more complicated than that. Like just as always, right with these, uh, you know, gene therapy launches, there's a lot of complexity and it was not only this. You know, safety events, you know, certainly did have an impact on the prescribing of some physicians.","char_start":14928,"char_end":18719,"start_time":"00:15:37","end_time":null}

You know, safety events, you know, certainly did have an impact on the prescribing of some physicians.\n\n00:19:19,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n But there was also flu season. And what I thought was really interesting is that they talked about. their top prescribing physicians. And one issue impacting guidance really being that their top physicians are fully booked and don't have any capacity to administer a drug to more patients. And so it's really the broader physician community that they need to spend more time with. And that's perhaps the physician community that, um, you know, uh, maybe is, um, you know, uh, maybe doesn't have the same capabilities as the as the top physicians to explain the risk-benefit to different patient populations and you know, talk to families about what that could mean. So as always, I think that sounds like there's more complexity than exactly what meets the eye and a lot of just.\n\n00:20:11,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n Uh, you know, execution issues. Um, as you know, this is not a typical for a gene therapy launch. I did think, and, you know, I'd be interested in other perspectives on this, but I do give credit to, you know, Doug Ingram and his team for just being very upfront and very direct about. You know, here's the change in guidance and here's why, and here's what we're doing about it. And I think they. We're very straightforward and direct, and put a plan in place that's really focusing on just higher touch support for a broader group of physicians that makes a lot of sense. And that's something we don't always get when we have these guidance revisions or a week order. So while certainly a challenging message to deliver, I thought they delivered that quite clearly.\n\n00:21:08,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n Great, thanks. So let's dive a little bit more into what's going on at the FDA. And I think, Tess, you stated it beautifully earlier. I think we are all in awe of FDA staff, both current and former, just incredibly experienced and dedicated professionals. They are doing their best. We're hearing a lot of good things about sort of the way they're engaging in meetings—uh, the way they're they're doing their best to respond quickly. A lot of this is outside their control. So when we talk about problems of the FDA, I want to remind listeners and everyone that this is not specifically about FDA staff. It's really about the nature of. The uncertainty, not only around what's happening with specific staffing vacancies, especially in leadership positions, but also just in terms of the process and some of these kind of potential changes that may come into play with new leadership at HHS all around. So, you know, there have been some few dates that that have been high profile that have not been met, such as. Self-biotherapeutic Sparth syndrome treatment, Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which we'll get to in a minute.\n\n00:22:12,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then, even as recently as this week, GSK, which they were looking for an additional approval for an additional indication in their IL-5 antibody for COVID-19, which they were hoping would compete with Sanofi and Regeneron's Dupixent in that indication, which they got that approval in September. So their stock took a little bit of a hit about that. So, you know, we are likely going to see more of these. But let's talk specifically about what's going on with the vaccine companies, starting with Novavax. I know Eric. You're covering them, and we also had comments. Sam and Jeroen also had comments on what's going on in these companies. So go ahead.","char_start":18419,"char_end":22150,"start_time":"00:19:19","end_time":null}

Sam and Jeroen also had comments on what's going on in these companies. So go ahead.\n\n00:22:49,050 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, thanks, Grace. Not covering them officially, but certainly paying close attention to this drama, like everyone else is. I think our listeners probably know that the COVID-19 vaccine that Novavax is trying to get approved. The PDUFA date earlier this month, or actually it was earlier last month, came and went. And still no word. And the company of course did its earnings call this week and continued to put forth the view that they think they've satisfied all the approval requirements for licensure. And at least they're hopeful that once they agree with the FDA staffers on a phase four commitment, can move forward here and get this drug approved. What puts that all at risk, of course, is the comments that senior leadership at the FDA has made. Dr. Macari in particular has you know, been out on X and various media outlets saying that. We need to rethink the approval process for COVID vaccines.\n\n00:23:50,070 [SPEAKER_5]\n You know, what's maybe most worrisome here is that the one thing that unites RFK Jr., Dr. Macari, and Dr. Prasad is antagonism toward. toward how we treated COVID and how we vaccinated.\n\n00:24:05,040 [SPEAKER_5]\n individuals against this. This infectious disease, you know, you could argue that Macquarie and and Prasad essentially owe their jobs to the fact that they were outspoken critics of COVID vaccination.\n\n00:24:19,400 [SPEAKER_5]\n I don't believe that, and it definitely does not sound, by the way, that Dr. Prasad is an anti-vaxxer. He certainly doesn't seem to believe. MMR causes autism, et cetera. But again, he and Macari have been very critical of this vaccine. What I think is going to be very, very interesting and is the reason we're all paying so much close attention is: should Novavax be able to gain some alignment with the review staff at CBIR. On this licensure, what will the higher-ups at the agency do? Will they let this go through or not? Just like to comment that you know, unlike some Peter Mark's decisions that were judgment-based. Called out earlier, Tess, you know, the issues that we had with, with Elvitas and Sarepta. You know, this is not really a scientific judgment call. This is unfortunately.\n\n00:25:10,560 [SPEAKER_5]\n A political call. So it'll be very, very interesting to see what happens. I don't believe there's any scientific basis. Around which this protein-based vaccine should not be approved. It's been proven safe and efficacious and obviously is. Saved many, many lives historically.\n\n00:25:27,490 [SPEAKER_5]\n No basis that I'm aware of that we shouldn't have licensure, but But we may not. And that'll be a very, very interesting point in time in our regulatory system, but I'll turn it over to others if they would like to comment.\n\n00:25:42,679 [SPEAKER_7]\n Yeah. Thanks, Sam.\n\n00:25:43,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thanks, Grace. So just to add a little bit to the very nice way that Eric put this, I was kind of thinking, okay. These folks aren't particularly fans of the mRNA vaccines. So therefore, maybe a protein vaccine will have more opportunity.\n\n00:26:04,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n Until, of course, the conversation turned to first, how you do the trials. And secondly, the comments that I've heard.\n\n00:26:12,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Against single antigen vaccines. The idea being that we want to move back to a technology that's— I don't know, guys— help me. How old is the killed virus vaccine, which supposedly provides a whole bunch more antigens? Um, to that platform of course takes the rock away from under the feet of all of these vaccines, because they're all single antigen vaccines. So if you put those two things together, being not in favor of approving COVID vaccines without a randomized clinical trial and not liking single antigen vaccines, if those continue to be the view of the FDA, then we have a problem.\n\n00:26:59,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n Now, I think what I've been hearing is, at the end of it, or at least the way that I'm reading it, is that they're not going to get in the way of getting these shots for people who are at risk. It's more the under 40s or kids or babies, etc.","char_start":21850,"char_end":26254,"start_time":"00:22:49","end_time":null}

It's more the under 40s or kids or babies, etc.\n\n00:27:15,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n The hope is that the at-risk population is still a big enough market, at least for the mRNA vaccine folks, Moderna and BioNTech, to continue to generate the revenues they've been doing.\n\n00:27:26,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, but Novavax—I don't see. I think they're stuck between a a rock and a hard place at the minute.\n\n00:27:34,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would agree on Novavax. I just would kind of set aside, Grace, you talked about a couple of different approvals, one of them being stealth and then the other both being COVID related. I would say I'm not necessarily worried yet about a PDUFA date for something perhaps more complex being delayed, right? Just. Rewinding back a couple of years, if you remember the drama around Sarepta saying, 'we don't need an adcom for Elavitas.' And then we do need an adcom for Elavitas or the CAR-T therapies, which were kind of marching towards approval. And then. you know, all of a sudden, like, you know, I think the ABECMA, like, PDUFA was put back and, you know, there was going to be an adcom. So I think, you know, even for you know, very well, you know, kind of published data sets. We've seen, you know, we've seen question marks come up throughout the approval process that have.\n\n00:28:37,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, caused, you know, some anxiety and shifted things around. I think that's not too unusual to happen. You know, once or twice or three times for reviews that are more complex. But if we see that happen as a pattern, I think that's where it would start getting more concerning. Talking outside of the infectious disease space, which I think is now being subject to what is really a different set of rules. We don't know yet whether Rare is going to be subject to a different set of rules and we're hearing some good words and we'll want to see some action.\n\n00:29:18,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, there's— Yeah, I was going to say— we have a tiny bit sliver of windows as to, on the rare side, what's going on at CBER. Ultragenyx continues to say that their review, remember, they're filing for gene therapy for MPS3, San Felipe syndrome, based on HAPRIN sulfate as a biomarker. Remember, they're one of three who were going into this accelerated pathway with CBER under marks. It looks like that continues to remain absolutely on track. And they're getting very constructive feedback, at least on the reviewer team. Again, I guess the question is going to happen. What is it actually going to happen when someone at the top needs to sign it? But we are seeing signs that at least certain innovation continues to be on track. On vaccine, again, it looks like, Sam, to your point, it's getting very bifurcated. It looks like most likely the mRNA vaccines that are approved. The next-gen version. probably will be authorized.\n\n00:30:20,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n but potentially with a stricter label, without new data requirements. That's at least the latest thinking. But at the same time, they are, to your point again, they're not even going to bother going for a new vaccine in the under 50.\n\n00:30:37,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n So the bar is raised. But that was also partially because they couldn't show up great efficacy. So the bar inevitably is going to get raised for vaccines. I think that's pretty clear.\n\n00:30:49,290 [SPEAKER_7]\n Great. Thank you, everybody. Very thoughtful discussion.","char_start":25954,"char_end":29609,"start_time":"00:26:59","end_time":null}

Thank you, everybody. Very thoughtful discussion.\n\n00:30:51,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the key word here is some uncertainty, although we're beginning to see some trends here. One more big policy topic before we get to some data and some other earnings and other tidbits. And that's, of course. Some of the announcements and the fear and the discussions going on around potentially incorporating a most favored nation policy. as part of this package coming up. I don't think it'll have the votes, but the goal was to tie Medicaid drug payments to the lowest prices paid in other wealthy countries. Countries, which of course would be a huge disaster for the industry. It's been estimated it would have up to a $1 trillion negative impact on the industry over the next 10 years. Even the Wall Street Journal had a sharply critical op-ed. By its editorial board on Wednesday and pointed out, I think appropriately so, that savings from the plan would be negligible. It would have huge impact on negative impact on innovation. I think there's been a lot of reporting and a lot of discussion that it's not enough.\n\n00:31:55,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n Enough key members of Congress on both sides understand this.\n\n00:31:59,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's going to be a non-starter in reconciliation.\n\n00:32:02,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n However, there is very real fear reported by a number of sources, including Politico. That there would probably be an executive order broadly addressing this as soon as next week, maybe even early next week. I don't know if we'll have time at the end, but there's a lot of advocacy going on. It's really important that they hear from us. And if we have a few minutes, we can talk about that. So of course, these challenges are coming on top of some of the uncertainty around tariffs. Um, based on that, we've had even more pharma announcements this week regarding increasing manufacturing and R&D investments in the U. S. including BMS with 40 billion on top of all their aggressive cost-cutting. Gilead mentioned an additional $11 billion and 3,000 jobs on top of a prior commitment of $21 billion, and Takeda promised a $30 billion investment.\n\n00:32:52,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n I know we touched upon this last week, and there was some discussion around how much of this is really additive to what they would have done anyway, versus brand new investments. And I know several of you, I think all of you had thoughts on all of these issues.\n\n00:33:08,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Why don't we start with Tess?\n\n00:33:09,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's been a whirlwind, Grace, because as you said, you know. So let's actually step back and talk about the first Trump administration. So in the first Trump administration, this MFN idea is not new. This was introduced in the first Trump administration. He brought it up in July of 2020, originally, I want to say, and it was for both Part D and B, as in, boy. Basically, saying, hey, we're going to look to a set of a certain set of OECD countries. And whoever is the lowest in those OECD countries on a GDP per capita adjusted basis. That is going to become. what Part D and Part B pays. It was further revised. There was a second executive order that came out, you know, a couple months later that was basically just for Part B, as in boy. Um, and there was actually a CMS interim final rule that came out a little bit later after that. That was focused on how this would be implemented.","char_start":29309,"char_end":32996,"start_time":"00:30:37","end_time":null}

Um, and there was actually a CMS interim final rule that came out a little bit later after that. That was focused on how this would be implemented.\n\n00:34:11,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n And the way that the executive order was drafted was to make it a CMMI demo. So what is CMMI? So CMMI, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. And CMMI does these demos. They're usually looking at things like, you know, hey, let's see how value-based care works and let's go to this one region and we'll do this value-based care pilot and we'll see if it's good. And if it's good, we're going to like. You know, encourage you know, legislation or something that would actually cause this to roll out more broadly. You know, kind of the classical way that CMMI has been used is for these pilots. Now, you know, that's a pretty darn big pilot. If you're like, well, the pilot is that we are going to cause the whole country to have, you know, price controls coming in from Europe. uh whatever is the cheapest european country is basically going to become the price and it's not just europe actually it's also Canada and Japan and New Zealand and Australia and a whole bunch of other countries that um you know really use like health technology assessments and other ways that, you\n\n00:35:14,590 [SPEAKER_4]\n know, are using math that I think Americans would be very, very uncomfortable with because it includes the judgment of. you know, the value of patient life that many Americans would not necessarily agree with to price those drugs. Um, And so that is kind of the history. And so I think the fear has been, okay, is MFN for Medicare going to come back? And then it was a few weeks ago, oh my gosh, is it going to be MFN for Medicaid? And Medicaid is not just Medicaid, the like 10% of drug volume. Medicaid is like. Oh gosh, Medicaid, best price. Best price has flowed through to so many other things, including 340B, which has totally exploded and is now like a very substantial portion of actual, you know, volume of branded drugs in the U. S. So either of these policies, either MFN for Medicare or Medicaid, would have a very substantial impact on price. Um, you know, on the price in the U. S., it would have a very substantial impact on incentives. And it would really encourage a lot of companies to think about just doing a U.S. launch.\n\n00:36:27,180 [SPEAKER_4]\n That still, even if you're saying, 'look,' companies have preserved the right to do US-US lunch, you're still kind of taking away the value that a company could have had by going to Germany and getting a few dollars from Germany and a few dollars from the UK and a few dollars from Canada. Those dollars can add up and become part of an NPV that is either positive or negative. On a relative basis when compared to other things and maybe taking out XUS. Actually, shifts that NPV and you no longer want to invest in that drug. And MFN would be a policy that greatly contributes to that and really lowers the opportunity size for you know, for a lot of drugs. And I think that's kind of the intent, Grace, is that I think the intent is very much. Actually. Other countries should be paying more, right? But we, as America, don't want to get less innovation in our attempt to get other countries to pay more.\n\n00:37:28,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n Let's try and use other methods that are available, like trade policy, to try and get other countries to pay more for drugs. So that is maybe just an overall. You know, perspective on you know, overall perspective on the legislation.\n\n00:37:45,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, I think. You know, MFN combined with tariffs. Really creates a challenging.\n\n00:37:55,890 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, set up for, you know, for pharmas, I feel incredibly sympathetic for any. Finance/Investor Relations departments of any pharma that has not yet reported earnings and is potentially going to be reporting those earnings after. An MFN announcement and potentially after a tariff announcement, which, you know, we hope MFN, you know, we may or may not get updates on those early next week.","char_start":32696,"char_end":36913,"start_time":"00:34:11","end_time":null}

Can I ask maybe just in part to be provocative, but but part serious, like: Most countries in lower income countries do reference price routinely. So why would we hold the U. S. to any different standard when it comes to the lower income part? Of America, the Medicaid patients. I mean, there is, you know, test to your point, like: The United States funds all the innovation for the world. And it's one of our most important exports, bioinnovation, these drugs that improve and extend lives. And for other countries to not. put in the same investment for that innovation is an obvious concern. Um, So again, philosophically, why shouldn't the U. S. institute a most favored nation policy as well, in part to incentivize other countries to pay more of their fair share.\n\n00:39:24,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n But also to align with. the practices of almost every other country in the world.\n\n00:39:30,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I think that the U. S. absolutely should be pushing other countries to make more investment, right? Like it is the kind of defense. The NATO problem is like why are we paying for all of this like great stuff that helps makes our like helps to make our world a better place like shouldn't others also be contributing. I think that intent is a very, very good one. The strategy is good. The tactics are bad, right? Doing that by.\n\n00:40:00,869 [SPEAKER_4]\n essentially instituting policy that would cause companies to solely launch in the US.\n\n00:40:07,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, okay, we can do that, but that is going to cause less drugs to be innovated and be created in the first place because the pie is just smaller, right? And the opportunity is smaller because they can't get those incremental dollars overseas.\n\n00:40:24,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n And so I think that the strategy is a really good one. I think there's better ways to do it related to. related to trade policy.\n\n00:40:33,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, I think. Having the U. S. really encourage other countries to pay, you know, GDP-adjusted amounts that are very much in line with the U. S. I think that should be a key objective in light of all of these trade deals that are going to be happening.\n\n00:40:56,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n Over the next couple of months, we saw the U. K. one yesterday, which was obviously a very specific circumstance. But I think that really should be an objective, and it would be much more practical as part of like a trade negotiation than it would be by this particular policy tool.\n\n00:41:15,790 [SPEAKER_7]\n Thank you.\n\n00:41:16,980 [SPEAKER_7]\n We've all seen how – oh, go ahead.\n\n00:41:19,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I add to the devil's advocate aspect that Josh just brought in? This is not my view. I'm not reading the future. But let's take what Jess just said. Say it becomes reality that I've developed a drug. I'm going to launch it in the U. S., only in the U. S. then there's no reference price. I can put whatever price I want. This might actually push drug prices in the U. S. higher because you've got no other reference. And then in two years' time, I'll go and launch it in Germany, bring the price down a little bit. And at that point, I don't mind getting reference to that because I've spent some time building the market in the U.S. and so there's one possibility. I mean, I don't know if it's a reality or not, or have I not thought it through enough? The second point I want to say is: Astrazeneca CEO. When I asked this question, he said, 'First, the US is that doing this, and Europe should pay its fair share.' Then he came back and added another layer to it. But the problem that the world has is that they take net prices.\n\n00:42:19,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n They should be comparing net prices to what people pay in the US and in Europe, for example, and in many cases. Those prices are very similar or very small differences. The problem pharma has is that they don't publish their net prices. Maybe they don't even know their net prices. But that's another element that I think has to be taken into account. We always talk about it, but we have no transparency on it.","char_start":36613,"char_end":41030,"start_time":"00:38:22","end_time":null}

We always talk about it, but we have no transparency on it.\n\n00:42:42,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think there's this issue. What's driving all of this is the issue of all the middlemen and we need PBM reform. So what's driving the populism on both sides, the left and the right, is what people actually pay when they go to the pharmacy. So it's pricing and access. The fact that we have co-pays for life-saving drugs is egregious, right? Nobody's going to be abusing drugs that they actually need. To improve their quality of life or lives, and also access to right, we're putting in place all these step edits so people are rightfully frustrated. And they take it out against the pharma industry because it's an easy scapegoat. But we've got 340B, which is also egregiously being abused. It's supposed to pay for drugs for people who can't afford it, but instead it's turned into a profit line for big hospital centers that are important employment drivers for their regions. And so their congressional leaders support it. So it's a big web. It's very complicated.\n\n00:43:42,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's very easy when people have to pay huge prices, premiums and huge copays, that's what's driving it. And it's also clear that in other countries, the way they do health economics does not adequately capture the cost aversion. And to your point as well, there's also not enough transparency. So there's a lot going on. And I think there's this broader picture where the industry needs to be less reactionary and think of a broad deal along the lines of what we've all been talking about here. But, but I'd love others chime in. Sorry. I think I was at Eric. I interrupted.\n\n00:44:15,350 [SPEAKER_5]\n You guys are all making some wonderfully lucid economic arguments about why this is a good or bad idea. I just want to interject that there's a whole political aspect to this. This proposal, that may or may not come out next week, is really a a democratic program. It's very progressive very leftist. So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens between Congress and this administration. Trump does come out and say, 'I think we should have MFN pricing. The first person is gonna slapping on the back is Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. AOC and the rest of the very progressive party component of the Democratic Party. It's going to be fascinating political theater. And the congressman, the Republicans in Congress, at least are going to hate this. So. It may really create some political repercussions that will not only be good theater but are really going to pit, I think, this administration against this Congress in a way that we've never seen before.\n\n00:45:18,660 [SPEAKER_5]\n I think we can. You can't lose sight of the bigger picture as well. Just throw that out there.\n\n00:45:24,330 [SPEAKER_7]\n But again, I guess that I think we lost you unless that's me.\n\n00:45:27,570 [SPEAKER_6]\n Thank you. I think we can hear. Grace, can you hear us? We can hear you.\n\n00:45:36,060 [SPEAKER_6]\n Maybe I look.\n\n00:45:37,740 [SPEAKER_7]\n Can everybody hear me?\n\n00:45:39,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, we can hear you, Chris. Yep. Let me actually, to Eric's point, we just published our podcast with John Crowley, I think, just a couple of days ago, who was fresh out of the Y. House. And of course, John is incredible. And of course, he's got a public job to do. But he's obviously a steadfast believer that. The White House is not intending to destroy the biotech industry. In fact, if we look, there's only been four commissions on different sectors of NASA, national importance. And biotech, of course, is the fourth. Obviously, the other one with chips, you know, AI and technology. And so, you know, overall, that's the goal: not to harm our industry. The goal is to try to bridge things. I don't think that we're going to be able to entice the Europeans to pay more for their healthcare systems. Not that I don't agree with it, but I'm not sure that's also, you know, what our job is. They have their own philosophy, and they're frankly already restricting access fairly severely.","char_start":40730,"char_end":45051,"start_time":"00:42:42","end_time":null}

Because if you index to the published price, that's one thing. The non-published price, frankly, I believe is proprietary and is confidential. You're doing. That's part of what you're paying the NHS. I don't know how the US government gets access to that to then reference it. So it's going to be, it's probably going to require some kind of potential political solution. Um, again, I love how you started, but you don't have the votes. I think this populism is a part of a much broader plan to ultimately negotiate a lot of things. I personally don't think this is the latter day.\n\n00:47:29,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, well, let's jump into, because we only have about 12 more minutes, and I want to make sure that we can get to data and earnings. I'm sure we could have several hours worth discussion on policy, and there will be more every week. So why don't we talk about some innovation coming out of Genocuri? I think, Sam, you wanted to talk about that?\n\n00:47:51,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, I mean, so this is an N of one trial or can we call it a trial, test, or experiment.\n\n00:48:00,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n And it's a Chinese company, and it's an in vivo CAR-T technology, and it has a 100% CR rate. So it's, you know, but then when you only have one patient, you're either going to be zero or a hundred percent. So the question, of course, ends up being the same thing that we ask of every CAR-T is: what's the durability? But it seemed like a very clean result.\n\n00:48:22,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n It avoids all the issues that you have to deal with when it comes to current allogeneic CAR-T manufacturing.\n\n00:48:30,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sorry, autologous CAR-T manufacturing. And we just have to wait and see what the rest of the data looks like. I just have to say that I do remember this. day that legend brought X number of a few patients to an ASCO presentation. And I think a lot of people didn't believe it. So I look forward to seeing more data here. And we all know that. That everybody is excited about in vivo CAR T as the next real big leap in CAR T therapy, because it will avoid a whole host of stuff, including manufacturing issues, preconditioning, et cetera. So that's, I think, as far as I can go, because there's not much else to talk about. It's just one patient.\n\n00:49:09,490 [SPEAKER_7]\n Absolutely.\n\n00:49:09,970 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, Tess, I know you wanted to talk about PTC and their update on their Huntington's disease program.\n\n00:49:16,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, absolutely. So PTC is Huntington's disease program. I mean, this is a disease area that's just been incredibly, incredibly hard to crack, very high unmet needs. And there was a lot of excitement around PTCs. [program] which had shown a positive impact on functional outcomes. And the relevant functional outcome. In Huntington's is something called CUHDRS.\n\n00:49:46,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, there was, you know, PTC talked about a potential path for accelerated approval that would be based on. really seeing a correlation of biomarkers, namely HTT reduction. as well as the UHDRS. And so people were very interested in looking for that connection, right? Novartis, you know, obviously also, you know, very heavily invested in this, you know, in this asset with, you know, a billion dollar deal that was announced many months ago. And. The data that came out earlier this week, that was a bit mixed. So they essentially saw that, you know, the blood HTT reductions looked, you know, looked good. We saw dose dependency, you know, we saw some clear reductions. You know, CSF, you know, HTT reductions, that was, you know, that was a little less, you know, a little less clean. And then, you know, resulting in, you know, just I think less, you know, dose response there.","char_start":44751,"char_end":48905,"start_time":"00:46:42","end_time":null}

You know, that was, you know, a little bit more challenging where, you know, in the stage three patients, we actually saw, you know, a fair bit of worsening for, you know, patients on the high dose drug. Now, you know, they also shared some data on. you know, see UHDRS at month 24 relative to, you know, natural history and, you know, that. You know, that was that was interesting and supportive data. You know, there was some supportive data on NFL. But I think the best reflection of investor anticipation around the probability of accelerated approval here. Is that when Vinay Prasad then got nominated for CBER a few days later, this stock did not move very much, and many other accelerated approval stocks did. So. You know, we'll have to wait more to see what the path is for PTC.\n\n00:51:54,340 [SPEAKER_4]\n For this, you know, for this drug. What the regulatory path could look like and if that's going to take a bigger trial or if there's a potential path with what they have.\n\n00:52:06,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n Great. Thank you. Let's move now to earnings. Obviously, earnings season continues. And there's some things that we're seeing macro level that I know Josh and Yaron wanted to touch upon. And then we were going to go into specific companies. So, Josh, why don't you start?\n\n00:52:21,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sure. Hopefully you can hear me because it seems like Sam's been a little erratic today. Yeah. So what's interesting, right, is that we're coming off a stretch where most product launches were actually doing quite well and the stocks were working around them. And then, we kind of ran smack first into the first quarter earnings. And, you know, first quarter, historically, one of the most challenging quarters of the year. You had plans— patients' transition plans, et cetera, and all sorts of headwinds. On top of that, we have some of the IRA headwinds that are kicking in. So this time, earnings were kind of all over the place, probably a little bit more bearish than bullish. Some exemptions for companies. Recognizing that the first quarter can be a difficult quarter. Number of stocks trading down fairly significantly on their earnings updates. Names like Day One, Amicus, Repta, we talked about, Sendox, Fathom, iEvents, iEvents, really.\n\n00:53:25,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, took took ahead as with their own revised guidance and a smaller group of companies that traded up significantly around their earning updates, some of those examples being Connexa, Acadia, and Blueprint.\n\n00:53:43,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so, you know, what we're seeing is actually an interesting dynamic.\n\n00:53:47,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n The IRA Part D redesign is actually having, it's a double-edged sword. It's a frenemy. It's a friend and an enemy in the sense that if you, for Part D drugs, who have been on the market, the companies no longer have to pay the copay support.\n\n00:54:03,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n Depending on how your drug is priced, for many of them, it's actually a tailwind. But for those who are very expensive drugs, then they have to pay the 20% copay. And it depends on what they get a lot of. volume. So that's actually a positive. But for drugs that have an IV and a sub-Q component, what we're seeing now is a flux away from IV towards sub-Q because it's much better for the patients. And then, suddenly, the companies now have to pay the 20% copay because their drugs are expensive and they hit the catastrophic. So it's definitely early, but we're definitely seeing a dual-prong approach so far. And I agree with Josh. Earnings has been, because of it, a little bit more unpredictable than it has been in the past. But overall, part TV design is probably going to end up being a fairly positive because of volume.\n\n00:54:49,980 [SPEAKER_7]\n Great. So thank you.\n\n00:54:51,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n So back to Josh on Crystal Biotechs and their new gene therapy program and what's going on with some of the things there.\n\n00:54:58,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I thought I'd flag this one. Not the best print for crystals.","char_start":48605,"char_end":52995,"start_time":"00:50:54","end_time":null}

Not the best print for crystals.\n\n00:55:04,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Hsv gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis, Belosa expectations were fairly high and they had some. Headwinds in terms of new patient starts and patients taking holidays, which is a great thing, because it means the drug's really working for those patients and they can take a little bit of break from dosing. But what caught my eye was, Alright. They're announcing a new indication, basically an HSV gene therapy eyedrop to treat neurotrophic keratitis, which is a condition we don't hear too much about. There's a drug approved from a private company, Dompe, I think I'm pronouncing that right. The drug's called Oxygen, right? But because they're a private company, they don't really report sales. No one pays attention to it. But there are some reports that suggest that this product is selling a billion dollars a year and it requires like six drops a day, six eye drops a day. So like every two hours for up to eight weeks. And so Crystal's trying to basically deliver the same therapy— the same therapy. a recombinant nerve growth factor using a gene therapy approach and Yeah, they've got some interesting validation in an animal model.\n\n00:56:13,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n They also have validation from Vigevec itself as an ocular eyedrop that looks like it's doing quite well for the DEB patients who have these corneal lesions as well. I think what's interesting about this, in terms of how it reflects upon the broader ecosystem in biotech, and how challenging it can be for companies to get any value recognition for earlier stage programs. We see it time and time again. I know it gets very frustrating for the companies because it can affect the cost of capital and their ability to invest in earlier stage programs. So nothing unique to Crystal about this. It got very little attention because most of the focus was on Vajavek, as one would expect it would be, and maybe some other. Later clinical stage programs, but it is a conundrum that the industry continues to face: 'How do you get the value credit?\n\n00:57:15,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n For earlier stage programs to lower your cost of capital to continue to invest in those earlier stage programs.\n\n00:57:26,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n See many great solutions to it. You're a little bit damned if you do and damned if you don't, if you don't invest in the early stage program. Even though you're not getting value ascribed to it, then eventually investors are going to come back and say, 'Hey, what else do you have for us?' And if the answer is well. We didn't invest because you didn't give us any credit to invest in them. That's not a fulfilling answer.\n\n00:57:51,910 [SPEAKER_3]\n Companies have to continue to invest higher capital dollars into those programs, knowing they're not going to get any credit for them for some time, but eventually investors are going to come back and say, 'Hey, what else do you have for us?' And you should have something to show for them.\n\n00:58:08,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's a great point. We have about a minute left. I know we wanted to touch on Novo and also some related news on Lilly. If we have one more minute, maybe some quick words around that. I know that Sam and maybe a couple others had comments.\n\n00:58:24,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n Okay, let's see if I can do it in a minute.\n\n00:58:26,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n Novo missed on Wegovy and they downgraded the guidance, and the share price went up. Lilly met on Q1, didn't change guidance, share price went down. Simple answer is that people expected the NOVO downgrade. So everybody was kind of positioned that way and the share price has gone up. And they gave some really positive comments about it. The rest of the year, Lily is sitting so relatively high on its valuation. I'm not commenting on whether it's cheap or expensive.\n\n00:58:56,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n And of course, when you. High valuation you need to deliver constant beats or raises. What is two things I want to highlight out of what Novo said: one is they're thinking that it would take until the through the second half of the year for the impact of the compounding pharmacies to wash through their inventory to reduce.","char_start":52695,"char_end":57134,"start_time":"00:54:49","end_time":null}

Now. We are.\n\n00:00:38,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n We started the week with the executive order from President Trump.\n\n00:00:46,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n Essentially around the drug pricing story. This has been something that's been brewing in the US for years. Similar things have been tried in the previous [year]. uh uh time that um uh president trump was was in the white house and this time uh we have it in a in a slightly more fleshed out form with several points that have been made in this executive order. The objective overall is to try and see if we can bring down US drug prices, or at least some of the US drug prices. Lots of things have been said. Share prices sold off really strongly.\n\n00:01:28,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um and um, then they jumped back up again and actually, I think, at least several pharma companies' stocks are back up. Um, on uh, above what they were at the beginning of the week. There are several elements that I'm going to tease out very quickly and then get going with the team here.\n\n00:01:47,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, if and if you can change this if you want, folks, so there was the 30-day ultimatum, which I read in there, you know, go go ahead, come back, come to us voluntarily.\n\n00:01:58,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n And in that period, also, HHS will be studying some drug prices and see what they can get. Then there's the 180 days. Um, that is to during which the negotiations or conversations will be taking place to try and see if we can come to a view in terms of taking prices down. And interestingly, I would say this ties in very strongly or very closely to the timeframe for the next IRA negotiations. And there was a conversation about in the executive order regarding the reimportation of drugs from other countries where the prices are lower, which would be interesting to talk about. There was a lot of talk about the unfairness of ex-US prices and how that's something that has to change, but would be nice to talk about whether there's any mechanism for this to happen. And then, of course, the element of direct-to-consumer sales, which we can talk about. So I'm going to turn to John first. You could take a peek at any one of those or an overall conversation, and let's just go.\n\n00:03:00,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, let me just start by saying that what I saw happen on Monday was not a most favored nation executive order, but a mostly fluff and nonsense executive order, to be crass. I mean, it was a very vague, very general, um, very non-specific, um, set of, you know, process-related steps that I think, and the market showed this, you know, people were very anxious about this the prior week. And things were weighing on the sector. And over the weekend, there was a lot of chatter that I was getting from my colleagues in the investment community. and in companies, and then Monday morning comes, and it comes out, and it is just a nothing burger at the end of the day. You know, clearly this president is hell bent on on some type of most favored nation mechanism.","char_start":0,"char_end":3556,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

You know, clearly this president is hell bent on on some type of most favored nation mechanism.\n\n00:04:04,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n But this executive order— you know— is the start what's clear about it is it's the start of a negotiation and and I think that's why, you know, that's why the investment community, you know, breathe a sigh of relief and calibrated what this actually is for what it is. It's the start of a long process and where it ultimately goes remains uncertain at this point in time. I do think that ultimately this president, if he's elected, will try to get some type of MFN mechanism in the industry, but it could be done in ways that are acceptable to industry. Actually, you know, whether it's done as part of the IRA. You know, when everything is calibrated back at 13 years, or, you know, if there's some other mechanism to maybe apply it to drugs that haven't been launched yet, so that, you know, U. S. companies can calibrate this measure into future launches, not existing launches, et cetera. There's certainly going to be some ongoing discussion about it, but there was nothing about what happened on Monday that fulfilled people's worst fears.\n\n00:05:12,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that's why, appropriately, the sector has breathed a big sigh of relief during the course of the week.\n\n00:05:21,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, Nina, did you want to? Jump in here.\n\n00:05:24,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n I wholeheartedly agree with with John's view that this is really a massive negotiation tactic.\n\n00:05:33,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n Although I don't like the stages of grief, I sort of feel like the industry is responding to these blows with a mix of denial and bargaining and distraction. And so I think taking MFN alone is probably not as useful as taking it in the full context of also tariffs threat, biosecurity section 232, IRA.\n\n00:05:57,969 [SPEAKER_1]\n renegotiation. And then, of course, the big, beautiful bill and the health care provisions that are embedded therein. But I think what the administration is trying to do is force pharma's hand to the table and also to continue to curry populist support. And it's working. I mean, $100 billion of committed U. S. investment into manufacturing and R&D. Facilities by, you know. five of the top ten, six of the top ten pharmas is a non-trivial amount. Now we'll see how much that sticks, because pharma can negotiate as well. And say, 'Hey, maybe we won't make those investments in favor of tariff relief or reduced MFN if this is going to continue to be coming at us from all directions.'\n\n00:06:43,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. And we do have Matt, so that's great to hear. Matt, do you want to jump in here?\n\n00:06:48,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, thanks, Sam. Good to be here. I think, and by the way, John stole the word that I was going to use, which is 'nothing burger.'\n\n00:06:55,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n sorry Matt.\n\n00:06:58,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, no, it's all good, John. By the way, one of the reasons that I participate in Biotech Hangout is so that I could be on on the same time as you someday, so that I could call you out for saying that Roivant would never be a great company in the Moose River article. Oh, man. Don't do that. I'm so sorry. I've been waiting for this moment for years, and I thought that was very mean of you. I'm sorry. uh thank you anyway.\n\n00:07:19,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's just the one time that John was mean.\n\n00:07:22,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just the one time. Look, I'll numb.\n\n00:07:27,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n On MFN, look, I think there's a few things here, one of which is a frustrating reality for the industry: that for all of the whirlwind of policy changes in [ in the administration that we've been sort of thinking through over the last month and a half or two months. This one is complicated because at some fundamental level, the administration is right. Right. That is like it is a bad fact for the industry that. And for America, but I'm thinking, like, for the industry, that prices are so different here versus other places. And in fact, the very thing we are dealing with now.","char_start":3258,"char_end":7508,"start_time":"00:04:04","end_time":null}

And in fact, the very thing we are dealing with now.\n\n00:08:07,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n Which is massive gyrations in strategy and value based on US drug pricing, is itself evidence of the problem that needs to be solved. That is like we are at the whims of one person's tweets, mostly because US drug pricing is so disconnected from the rest of the world. And that if we could somehow fix this problem, even if it meant a temporary or permanent bump along the road where things got reset from a value and return perspective. But then we got to grow in a more equitable and evenly distributed way. I think there's like some advantage to that world, although it would be a very painful path.\n\n00:08:45,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n I do think there's a lot of complicated risks. Hidden in this discussion. First of all, Pharma's going to come to the negotiating table.\n\n00:08:53,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think the people most likely to be at that negotiating table are going to be big pharma CEOs.\n\n00:09:00,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n and large commercial organizations representing a portion of the status quo and thinking a lot about their business. I'm a little bit worried biotech won't be as represented at that negotiating table and that our interests are slightly different. We're much more focused on future drugs than current drugs. We're much more focused on the way this plays out in different kinds of markets and in various aspects of the value picture, and so I'm a little bit worried about like how we get involved as an industry and make sure that, like, the longer term picture— how I would describe biotech interest— because necessarily, the vast majority of our companies are either development stage or earlier in their lives are represented. And then, like, I think a worry for the country and to some degree for Trump is that I think gotten wrong, will lead to higher drug prices in the U.S. S because people will start abandoning other jurisdictions, not worrying so much about MFN and then just like pricing here to try and make up the delta, and so I think there's like a lot of complicated minefields in the actual negotiation that's about to take place, which by the way is like a much more\n\n00:10:09,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n cogent and interesting negotiation than anything on pharma tariffs, which is mostly I think correctly understood as a tax policy debate.\n\n00:10:17,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. I mean, Matt, pretty much the entire tariff setup is a tax. I mean, it's just called a tariff. A tariff is a tax, right? Can I just say one thing? Yes, go ahead.\n\n00:10:27,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I just jump in on one thing? Obviously, aside from apologizing to Matt, but on the topic of prices, and I do think that that you know we we obviously have um discrepancies in many cases between U. S and foreign drug prices, but let's not forget that this happens up and down the healthcare system, whether it's MRIs, whether it's CT scans, whether it's mammograms, whether it's, I mean, name your procedure, US versus rest of world, vastly different prices, much more expensive. Here. And so, you know, it is an overall issue from a healthcare system standpoint. And you just can't ignore that. I mean, nobody should, because our overall healthcare costs in general are higher.\n\n00:11:17,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Do agree with you, Matt. Obviously, the industry, to the extent that there is a negotiation, it'll likely be with the larger companies. I'm sure Bayo will try to get as involved as possible and represent the smaller company voice, and I'm sure they'll do a good job with that as best as they can. But it will mostly be with the larger companies where there's money. At the end, that's all there is to it.","char_start":7208,"char_end":11136,"start_time":"00:08:07","end_time":null}

At the end, that's all there is to it.\n\n00:11:40,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think the point about— I think it's such a wonderful point about caring about the drugs of today versus the drugs of tomorrow. And what's interesting is to contemplate Europe in particular. But really the rest of the world, becoming kind of like a Medicaid, where on the one hand, we're trying to eliminate or increase transparency and reduce gross net spread with PBMs in the U. S., but we might go to a model where pharma is cutting deals with other markets with confidence. Contracts and other obscurities where you maximize that gross to net and you end up like Medicaid, where you have a 50% effective rebate. To bring you down to the actual.\n\n00:12:24,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I've heard this argument, like I was at the BAML conference in Las Vegas this week or whatever. I've heard this argument a lot and I find it, like, plausible on the one hand. It's the thing that I'm a little bit dubious of. Is that pharma companies are going to successfully manage to keep information from the U. S. government on this. It's like I'm a little bit dubious that. Whatever policy is passed is going to have a large enough loophole on pricing to allow people to like, say, well, our list price with France is X, but, like. secretly we're giving them a 50% rebate that we're not telling the US about. So I'm a little bit worried about that line of reasoning, just because I think the government has ways.\n\n00:13:02,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh and uh.\n\n00:13:04,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n We're going to have to deal with those ways later, especially for U. S. domicile manufacturers where the government gets all the information. Thanks.\n\n00:13:12,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so look— one of the things that I think is worth perhaps bringing up a little bit is: Where drug prices are always much higher in the US than Europe or elsewhere. If you wind the clock back 20, 25 years, were they much higher? And I think the answer is no.\n\n00:13:31,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n And correct me if I'm wrong. And then, so to understand how we ended up where we are today, what changed in the process to create a world? Uh, that—that— that managed to get itself into this massive divergence in some cases— not in every case— there's a divergence. Right. So people talk about net prices, et cetera, I think that applies a lot to drugs that go through standard pharmacy, but I'm pretty sure that Keytruda isn't discounted at 50, 60, 70, 80, for instance. I'm just picking up Katrina for no reason. What happened in between? Part of it is because we are dealing with a free market, so therefore its pricing is set between players and the government has not had any input. Whereas in Europe and most other countries, it is directly the government that negotiates. There are no middlemen.\n\n00:14:22,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n But. If that's one part of the element, what else has happened here that has allowed this situation to occur?\n\n00:14:31,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I mean, Sam, clearly one aspect of that is the role of PBMs and the discounts that they command and the rebates that they command and how that affects U. S. manufacturer price at the end of the day. That is absolutely a factor here that creates more of a discrepancy in prices around the world.\n\n00:14:53,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n The US healthcare system is the only healthcare system in the world where, basically, no participant who has any control also wants prices low. Right. So obviously, pharmaceutical companies generally like higher-priced environments. Hospital systems, doctors, physicians, providers like higher-priced environments.","char_start":10836,"char_end":14715,"start_time":"00:11:40","end_time":null}

Right. So obviously, pharmaceutical companies generally like higher-priced environments. Hospital systems, doctors, physicians, providers like higher-priced environments.\n\n00:15:14,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Insurance companies, under the Affordable Care Act, are capped on margin at about 15% by the medical loss ratio rules. So while shocks are bad for them, actually, the only way an insurance company can go profit under the Affordable Care Act is increasing direct health care costs. So their actual incentive is to see a slow and steady rise of health care costs. And the one institution that actually is a concentrated influential buyer of health care— the government— is at least as far as drug prices are concerned heavily restricted in its actual ability to negotiate and, so, the US is the only country in the world actually where there is really almost nobody actually out there trying to keep prices down.\n\n00:15:51,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right, so the solution here of course, one of it is to give the gut— which is what's happening— to pass part of the area, give the government some ability to negotiate prices. But at the same time, something that now suddenly this week everyone forgot, obviously not on this call, but I've done endless interviews for the Bloomberg TV friends and radio. And it's just they forget that there's this net pricing, there's this middleman, there's this system in place. And also the fact that. Everybody forgets that the rest of healthcare is also more expensive in the US than it is in Europe. Nobody seems to question that. When I have a relative of mine who got flu and was hospitalized for nine days in San Francisco, $250,000 bill, you will never see that here. Never. I mean, okay, it would be big, but it won't be $250,000. So when we look at these percentages of money for prescriptions, drugs spent as a percentage of healthcare spend. In fact, you find that some European countries are bigger than, higher than the United States, but the pie is smaller, so the actual spend on drugs is lower.\n\n00:16:56,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, so I want to ask you this next. Do you see any way that by the end of this year, we haven't had some pressure on drug prices one way or another, whether it's through the IRA, the next negotiation, or some other way?\n\n00:17:15,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n Don't see it happening.\n\n00:17:18,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n Within the year, I don't see it happening.\n\n00:17:19,829 [SPEAKER_2]\n You don't expect any price pressure?\n\n00:17:22,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n What are you— I think that with all the things that have to get done. To make a change like that.\n\n00:17:32,209 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't see it happening.\n\n00:17:33,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. And Matt, Nina?\n\n00:17:37,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Do you want to make it not a major, but a point here on this? Do you think, by the end of 2025, there would have been some, not necessarily actual, but some negotiated prices that might kick in in a year or two years?\n\n00:17:51,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think there will be superficial negotiations by big pharma companies trying to forestall worse policy change along the same lines as what I would.\n\n00:18:02,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n This is maybe not a great thing to say publicly, but what I would call largely what I expect to be superficial guarantees of investment domestically.\n\n00:18:09,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n We'll come to that.\n\n00:18:10,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think the places where this is most likely to happen are places where the writing is on the wall and there's going to be pricing pressure anyway. And so I think, yeah, in the obesity space, I think we'll see a series of negotiated compromises to try and close the gap a little bit because the truth is, between competition and other things, it's just coming anyway. So I do think, like, this year, we will see some version of the grand gesture, whether those grand gestures will have any ultimate impact to consumers or prices paid.\n\n00:18:45,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Depends a little bit on whether it's like a promise to whatever the ideas of a plan versus an actual agreement. Uh, and also unlike who's making those agreements and why. But I think we'll see. Something. Do I think we're gonna see successfully implemented.\n\n00:19:01,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Government scale MFN policy by the end of this year.\n\n00:19:05,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think if it can be achieved by executive order.","char_start":14415,"char_end":18886,"start_time":"00:15:14","end_time":null}

No, uh, and I think otherwise it would be surprising to me. If the legislature could get something through.\n\n00:19:21,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n I really agree with that.\n\n00:19:24,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, the only executive order path would be through a CMMI demonstration project with Medicare. And that was proposed. Back in November of 2020, and was was challenged and failed, mostly due to process reasons, but you know, even there, it would take a lot of time to implement it, and a lot of a lot of the guidelines for that would be challenged legally. So again, I think it's going to take a long time to see any of this get into the industry.\n\n00:19:57,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n I do wonder if we'll see. Sorry, go ahead, Nina.\n\n00:20:00,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, please do. Finish your thought. I just wonder if we're going to see, actually, the part of this that is ill-circumscribed, difficult to wrap your head around, is like how the ways in which the government puts pricing pressure on drugs sold in the US are relatively easy to imagine. The ways in which the government puts pressure on increasing drug prices overseas are harder to imagine. but I think that uh, The current administration has shown us all some patterns on which it's able to do things like that. And I do think we might actually see.\n\n00:20:31,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n some of that activity this year that is, if the government actually winds up caring about this issue and focusing on it, we may find out about bilateral negotiations around.\n\n00:20:42,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n commitments on drug pricing and closing gaps.\n\n00:20:45,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n As part of broader trade bills, for example. Right. I think that's definitely a possibility.\n\n00:20:50,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n Nina, after you. Go ahead, Nina.\n\n00:20:54,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n I was just going to say that I think that outright price reform is unlikely to come, but I think the broader business pressures, unless maybe there will be some PBM. uh uh reform uh legislated enough in a final um final budget but uh but aside from that, I don't think there'll be direct pricing impacts the incorporation of part B into IRA obviously has its possibilities. But I do think that there will be broader business pressures that are anti-innovation and that are difficult on the sort of pharma P&L, biopharma P&L.\n\n00:21:34,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I sat down with some of our colleagues here in Europe who are closely looking at these trade negotiations. And their view was: 'There's no mechanism by which the US can put, apart from gentlemanly conversations or lady conversations, whatever the correct way of saying it is, into a trade deal because it's not actual trade. Europe doesn't buy the drugs that it sells in general from the US.\n\n00:22:05,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Can't really force Europe to raise its prices. And let's not forget, we are in the same time being forced to raise our, that Europe being forced to raise its defense budget, there is a limit to which how much suddenly can start increasing. And with defense, the US had a lever that was, I am going to spend less.' If you want NATO and your security to be as good as it was before, you're going to have to raise your numbers. Here, there is no other, there is no lever, except for if the companies start saying, 'Okay, we're going to delist from Europe.' And if I do what Matt said, you know what? Even drop our prices, raise our prices, which is politically awful. And I don't think it will happen. But that's the sort of thing that could go on. There's one other element here that my colleague Duane Wright has suggested. He thinks that the IRA sets a price ceiling but no floor. So referencing foreign prices, even though they're sort of lower levels, isn't a criteria in the IRA statute today, but it still allows them to take factors that aren't weighted.\n\n00:23:13,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n So providing what would be a wide latitude for the cuts so they could push some of those through. In November, which is 180 days by the way. Um, through the IRA and at the very least declare some victory and move on.\n\n00:23:30,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um.","char_start":18586,"char_end":23061,"start_time":"00:19:01","end_time":null}

Born pathway. And I just think that there's going to be a lot of resistance from the administration on doing something like that.\n\n00:23:48,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's talk about two more items here, reimportation.\n\n00:23:53,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n The possibility and then the reality.\n\n00:23:57,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n How likely is that?\n\n00:24:02,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n Buying it, bringing them in from Canada, shipping them over from Mexico, buying it in France and shipping over here— to the U. S.\n\n00:24:12,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it's a very low risk.\n\n00:24:18,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it's a very low risk.\n\n00:24:19,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that Silas was telling me that.\n\n00:24:22,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, yes, I don't know if Matt and Nina agree, but I—I think it's a very low risk.\n\n00:24:27,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think it is, like many of these things, just much more likely to be. A negotiating cudgel than an actual solution, but I think it's reasonably likely to be threatened as a part of the negotiation.\n\n00:24:40,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n That favors the tariff debate, though.\n\n00:24:43,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n It does, but the administration isn't going to tax their own imports of necessary medicines.\n\n00:24:48,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now, John, let me ask you this question. You were factoring drug as a line of X here in the US and also in Europe. Would you, as a pharma company, allow sufficient volume in Europe? To then be available for re-importation to the US because you control that. So that's the problem, right? Of course not, yeah. Of course not. That is the biggest issue.\n\n00:25:11,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n So and the other one, of course, is that's not mechanically true, right? That is like you control it in the sense that you want to ensure adequate supply for Europe and, in a world where the US allowed reimportation, you'd cut off supply for Europe. But if the price in Europe is X and the price in the US on list price is 2X, and you can sell it for 1. 5X here, people in the world have incentive to move it across the border. Again, it's true that you could cut off supply or, maybe, European countries could restrict exports because they want adequate supply. Bye. The point remains that, like enterprising people, can move drug if allowed to do so. As long as the volume is there.\n\n00:25:46,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, if the volume is there and, if there are no consequences for the country that's doing that, which may not be the case.\n\n00:25:56,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. And then the next question, of course, is the direct consumer sales. Now, we've seen some already before this executive order comment. Lillian Novo, Lillian Direct, et cetera. Now, how many types of drugs can you actually do that for?\n\n00:26:13,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n And. how real is that? What are the barriers to that? I haven't even started to think about that part of it because it would be interesting to see if any companies actually step up and say, 'We're going to do this.' Any thoughts there?\n\n00:26:29,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think it's fairly unlikely. I think in the GLP-1 space, I think there is a supply chain management that needed to be resolved and somewhat of a referral base for patients to get prescribed. But I think the direct-to-consumer companies like Ahimsa are a row that actually have. The sort of, you know, corporate practice of medicine, air cover, are servicing that need. And I think where pharma may continue to occasionally do it is for ultra, other ultra specialty products for orphan, rare or vaccines, where supply chain and timeliness is so critical. But I don't see a trend of biotechs or a pharma wanting to be in the business of practicing medicine and taking on the potential conflict risk of prescribing their own drugs.","char_start":22761,"char_end":26899,"start_time":"00:23:13","end_time":null}

So I think we're nearly half an hour, half the way through. And this was the biggest topic this week. I would say that, if I'm concluding everything you've said, is that legislation is very tough by the end of the year. There may be some gestures, either by the companies or some wins by the administration, which could come through some mechanisms, maybe through the IRA mechanism, before the end of the year. But in reality, this is likely to fall into the same camp as the effort fell into last time round.\n\n00:27:52,749 [SPEAKER_1]\n Before we leave policy, Sam, and I definitely don't want to obfuscate your— moderation role. But I'd love to hear and a couple of other things, you know, that are in the in the big beautiful bill that touch on health care and particularly. From um, from Matt and John, who are a bit more frontline operational, you know, what, what their handicapping is of, of some things moving, moving forward. I'm specifically interested in.\n\n00:28:20,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n In uh, tax deductions for R &D in current year versus amortized over three, as well as potential elimination of tax deduction for advertising spend. And how that might might effectuate or actually implement.\n\n00:28:37,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I'm going to let Matt cover it because I have not studied.\n\n00:28:41,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Those um deeply to personally I don't know Matt if you have Not at the level of having, first of all, I think anybody who tells you they can predict inclusion in current government legislative proceedings is lying.\n\n00:28:56,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n But yeah. But having said that, in terms of our decrepit amortization, Look, I think that's going to be just like a super heavily lobbied issue, to be honest, because this is not like a. There's gonna be no layperson opinion on that it's just gonna be down to like like the power of the respective tax lobbies versus the government policy. And I think we'll see. On the DTC piece, I guess, first of all, my general view is as a as an instrument to try and affect the use of the advertising.\n\n00:29:32,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tax policy is probably not going to be that effective. That is, ultimately, if what you're doing is increasing by 25% or something, the cost of all DTC advertising, I don't think that's likely to have a massive impact on most DTC spend.\n\n00:29:49,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n And so I think that is therefore possible and I suspect in some places popular as an idea, so it could get included in some bill. But I don't think it's actually going to have a big impact on how companies behave.\n\n00:30:03,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'm sitting in Connecticut, so I'll reference Chris Murphy's No Handouts for Drug Advertisements Act. Where, um, there's a, I believe it's Brookings, there's an analysis suggesting that from the six billion spent annually on direct-to-consumer advertising, one and a half to 1. 7 billion of tax revenue could be recouped. So it's not a trivial number. Um, that they could implement.\n\n00:30:30,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n Look, I think it may be a smart way for the government to raise a billion and a half dollars. I just think most of the people spending that $6 billion will spend 7. 7%.\n\n00:30:42,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n Nina, while you've got the mic there, did you want to also just touch on the orphan cures and maybe the PBM reform conversation?\n\n00:30:53,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think we touched a little bit on PBM reform, but there is some populist as well as congressional support for banning spread pricing and requiring more reporting of rebate amounts and pricing structures and contracts.","char_start":26599,"char_end":30513,"start_time":"00:27:14","end_time":null}

So I think there may be something there. And also restrictions on steerage. One concern or conflict has been the ability of an integrated payer PBM to be able to steer to their own, for example, mail order pharmacy, which may not be the lowest cost source. So I think there's a bit of analytical momentum behind that as well. And then, on orphan, you know, orphan cures, there's been a lot of initiative, and I think it's fallen on pretty receptive ears, certainly in the prior administration, but even in the new, to exempt orphan drugs from the Inflation Reduction Act negotiations.\n\n00:31:57,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n That was a big win.\n\n00:32:00,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n That was a big win.\n\n00:32:00,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Big win. Big win. It's not yet law, but it feels like it's got good bipartisan support. And at least under the former FDA, there was also generally a lot of support for accelerated R &D and innovation to incentivize drug development for orphans. Diseases and hand in glove with that is an orphan drug tax credit, which historically had been 50%, was lowered to 25% for clinical expenses that could be deducted. And it sure would be nice to see that come back to 50%. And then there are other things that have been going on more on the regulatory versus on the policy side, where I think it's just going to be a little bit of time will tell to see how Macri and Prasad decide to implement.\n\n00:32:49,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n They don't both necessarily see eye to eye there.\n\n00:32:52,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's a lot of that not seeing eye to eye, at least based on initial commentary before some of the folks came in. So we'll see how that pans out.\n\n00:33:01,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's interesting. The other element, of course, on the overall picture here is the pledges made by pharma companies. We touched on that a little bit. I worked out just with the large pharma. The biggest, of course, the number was from Johnson & Johnson at 55 billion. So far, the smallest has been Merck at nine. These are very difficult to compare on an apple-to-apple basis, because as you saw today, the latest one to come up this week or yesterday or today was 20 billion dollars from Sanofi. But you read the message and it says that we're looking at, you know, putting money in various things. So here it goes. It is 20 billion to 2030.\n\n00:33:41,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sanofi will substantially increase spending in the US on R &D. That's ongoing R &D. That's not new capital expenditure.\n\n00:33:51,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n Also plans to expand its US manufacturing capacity, fine. How much? I don't know, right? As well as through partnerships, et cetera. While Sanofi's investment decisions will be adjusted as the external environment continues to evolve. Very interesting extra comment here. The planned investments are expected to create significant number of high-paying jobs in the United States across various states.\n\n00:34:13,989 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think Roche also did the same thing. And interestingly, Roche came out and said, 'Look, actually, if you want to go down that path with the most favored nation and pressuring us.' The reason we want to invest more in the US is because it's where we make most of our profits. And most of the research has been done. But if you then take away those profits, what's the incentive? They didn't quite say it like that, and I'm not sure how much should be attributed to Roche on this. But the reality is it's complicated.\n\n00:34:40,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n The direct quote was: 'Should the proposed executive order go into effect, Roche's ability to fund the significant investments previously announced in the U. S. will be in question.'\n\n00:34:51,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n End quote. I guess that was pretty clear.

Guess why.\n\n00:34:54,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n The timing was not inconsequential on the 14th.\n\n00:34:59,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, but it's critical because it's simply saying you're going to dwindle my cash flow. How can I do it? Right, I mean, there's no magic here except if they are able to suddenly, over the next six months, raise all their prices across Europe. But that's not going to happen. These things take a long, long time. And I'm not convinced that these that these pledges are going to make a humongous difference in terms of new employment. We did, we have seen numbers that they've suggested over five years, which end up being two thousand, one thousand, three thousand. Which is great, right? But it's not the sort of, the top line number looks a lot more interesting at $234 billion than the actual reality.\n\n00:35:48,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, we'll see where that $234 billion ends up in actual dollars, because, as has been said by some, including I think it was AbbVie CEO, a heavy lobbying for some tax relief in exchange for billions of investment.\n\n00:36:07,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n Some of those dollars may make a full circle back to. to industry. In addition to helping to purchase some concessions on tariffs.\n\n00:36:15,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right now, one way the five and slowly moving on—I'm trying to separate to the next discussion that companies can manage their margins if this really hits hard is through productivity gains. And one way of gaining productivity gains across the entire industrial and non-industrial space is through AI. Um, many you know we've seen the CEO of the Norwegian Wealth Fund. Thank you. Turn around and say that I'm not hiring any more people. That's what we're gaining—20– 30 efficiencies through AI, which is okay; it's a knowledge-based business.\n\n00:36:55,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n But many factories, if they ever come back to the US, will probably be manned by, if you want to call it that, by robots. So it's not necessarily that the factory that they're going to add employment to. But AI is a big one. And Nina, you wanted to pick up on the reckoning for AI drug discovery. That'd be an interesting comment. And of course, that's one sliver of what we're— what you could do with AI within the pharmaceutical chain.\n\n00:37:23,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Do you want to take that up?\n\n00:37:25,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure. And first, Sam, awesome segue to productivity. Well done. And I have to say, to the extent that I said AI reckoning, I probably should have put a question mark after it because it was really a reflection of seeing. The news of pipeline reorganization at Recursion on their first quarter call. Um, in silico seeking to go public again, maybe third time's a charm on the Hong Kong stock exchange to continue to fund their activities and then in Citro doing a um 60-person, 22% reduction in force for, again, team efficiencies. So the question, and particularly, I think, looking under the hood at Recursion, a lot of talented, great people there. But this pipeline reorg came. Pretty quick on the heels, six, seven months after they acquired Excientia. And the discontinuations of five drugs includes several internal but also several from from that merger.\n\n00:38:26,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n So the question really is, you know, and they announced a big lean in to analytics on the clinical development side. To drive productivity in drug development and not just in target and drug discovery. So the question, you know, with 450 million of annual burn and five, $600 million of cash— is there a bit of a. of an existential moment?\n\n00:38:53,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n Existential moment, if I pardon my pun.\n\n00:38:57,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n And and similarly for, you know, dipping, trying to dip into the public markets for in silico shortly after they raised another 100 million series a couple of months ago and then in citrus and citrus cuts. So I believe there's huge, huge power in the models also predicated on tremendous integration and access to data. And then the repetitive, recursive use of the models on the data to generate insights and productivity. But in this market, can you continue to do it at a scale where your burn rate is that high and your org is that large?","char_start":34204,"char_end":38619,"start_time":"00:34:51","end_time":null}

But in this market, can you continue to do it at a scale where your burn rate is that high and your org is that large?\n\n00:39:34,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. You know, I'm a huge fan of AI. I'm trying to see where can we increase our, literally, the word productivity, perhaps a bit overused. But double my capabilities, let's put it that way, in terms of gathering information, analyzing information. The question I have, sorry, Matt, just one sec. I'll come back to you. The question I have, which is, then you can delve into it, is this, are we, I remember the days of SNPs back in the day. In the late 90s, I remember a company called Genset in Europe being the one where they had 100 sequences looking for SNPs and they were going to solve everything.\n\n00:40:14,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Wondering to a degree whether we're at such an early stage of this at the very early parts of drug discovery of this application of this technology that that's simply what we're going through and that in the end it will all be part of the system and everybody will take it for granted. So that over to you.\n\n00:40:31,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, two things. One is I really liked your segue, but how's this for a different segue, which is that pharma companies talking about use of AI is like pharma companies talking about making investments in the US. That is, it's a thing they feel obligated to do. You're so cynical. Well, I am to some degree.\n\n00:40:50,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n We have a couple of efforts within Roiven on AI in various aspects of real estate discovery. We have a really good model for protein-protein interactions. And I think there's tremendous promise.\n\n00:41:03,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n In some of these tools. I think the sooner we can get away from like talking about AI, capital A, capital I in quotes as like a thing, the more likely it is that we'll be able to make productive progress because I think. Right now, it is like both a buzzword and a set of tools. And I think they kind of get in each other's way.\n\n00:41:21,939 [SPEAKER_3]\n I agree.\n\n00:41:24,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n John, I wanted to ask you, actually, do you want to add a little bit more to this? Yeah, no, no, I do. What about supply chain? What about manufacturing? No, I think they're wonderful.\n\n00:41:32,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think they're wonderful places to integrate AI into what a company does, whether it's on the discovery side, the clinical trial side, simulations, the whole. Nine yards, but it has become a bit of a hype word. And I'm also cynical about how people think about it as if it's a thing itself. And there's, of course, enormous overuse of the word when it's really just computation in some cases, not machine learning. So I think, you know, it's a great tool. It's a great, great tool. And we ought to be using it and embracing it. And we are as an industry. And it will help productivity. There's no doubt about that. But we're far away from being able to push, type in a disease of interest, and push a button and have a small molecule structure emerge from the computer that is the cure for that disease. We're very far away.\n\n00:42:29,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thank you.\n\n00:42:30,779 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right.\n\n00:42:31,060 [SPEAKER_3]\n You've said it now, so let's stop talking about it.\n\n00:42:33,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n Think we're onto something with this. I think computers are going to make a big impact on.\n\n00:42:37,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n What about computers? I think they're going to matter.\n\n00:42:41,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think computers are going to be big for supply. I think someday every person working at a biotech company is going to have a computer on their desk. Wow. Okay. I love that prediction.\n\n00:42:51,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n And it will be plugged into the internet.\n\n00:42:53,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Come on, enough, enough. Let's talk about something that is actually also happened, another potential headwind, and that's the IRA Part B guidance from CMS.\n\n00:43:07,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n So who wants to take that?\n\n00:43:10,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n It really hit Halo hard.\n\n00:43:14,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Don't you take it? I'll take it. So obviously, but the issue here has been if you um formulate a IV drug. I mean, this is the biggest issue that there's been.

So obviously, but the issue here has been if you um formulate a IV drug. I mean, this is the biggest issue that there's been. I mean, there might be other versions of this that could be applicable.\n\n00:43:29,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n In my mind, if you formulate an IV drug with highly runny days to make it potentially subcutaneous and it works, and you spend quite a lot of time to convince the FDA that actually it's the same drug as the IV.\n\n00:43:44,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then you go to IRA part B guy and say, 'Actually, it's not the same drug.' We should have an extension on this. It shouldn't be considered. Darzalex IV shouldn't be considered the same as Darzalex sub Q. But you've just spent all your time saying that it's bi-equivalent. So one of my questions was always: is this not an obvious situation that's going to occur? Which, of course, then Merck's share price, because they're working on Cthulhu sub-Q, and Johnson & Johnson's share price sold off on the back of this. It's an issue for both of them. And so now I'm wondering whether I've got this wrong. And actually, that is a completely new drug and it should have been considered as a new drug. If anybody disagrees or agrees, just make a comment and then we can go on.\n\n00:44:34,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Honestly, I think it should be considered the same drug. I mean, it's the same active ingredient at the end of the day. And I think we ought to just be honest about that. At the end of the day.\n\n00:44:46,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's sort of hard to make the case scientifically that it's a different drug. It's formulated differently, it's presented differently.\n\n00:44:56,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's got certain features that are good and beneficial and so forth. But it really is the same drug. It's called a spade, a spade.\n\n00:45:07,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, well, exactly. But that's not always the case. I've had negative experiences with a very, very anecdotal development plan where we got pushed back and told that this was not, uh, amenable to a 505(b) 2 and had to go a full-on, um, randomized, randomized trial, but be that as it may, if it's going to be treated from a regulatory perspective as bioequivalent and substantially the same, even if it has some intellectual property insights that allow it to be novel. I think this is where we could use a category of super generics. There should still be some sort of premium to an IV generic for a product that. Increases convenience, reduces burden to the system, reduces cost, and potentially in so doing, you know, increases um— you know, positive outcomes. But it probably shouldn't be that of a of an nce.\n\n00:45:56,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's an excellent point, Anita. And I think in a single payer world, maybe people would take account of the fact that you're reducing physician time and physician costs, etc.\n\n00:46:07,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n But so be it. We'll find out in 2028 whether Darzalex or Keytruda, whichever one comes first, is hit by this. Now, we had a few other stuff going on. Something very interesting this week, which was Galapagos.\n\n00:46:21,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, wanted to do something. Uh, then, then change his mind. So, John, or Matt, do you want to take us through that?\n\n00:46:32,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm happy to work. Go hit them. You go.

You go.\n\n00:46:36,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n I like this topic because there's been some, including on versions of the show that I've been on, like, like so much discussion of these, like companies trading under cash or cash trapped in companies. And I think Galapagos is such an interesting example of the thing because we've sort of gotten to watch the whole thing play out in a very public and specific way. And I remember it was early. So the thing that happened this week is Galapagos had previously been planning. To spin out a effectively like a cell therapy program under its former CEO, Paul Stoffels, into a new co, or I think actually they were going to spin the rest of the thing into a new co and leave that as called Galapagos. But either way, they're now sort of second guessing that decision. And have changed out leadership for Henry most recently of New Mora and are sort of, yeah, pushing forward, trying to figure out what to do. The thing that I think is interesting about this is, so I remember being in a room with the, the, the former, like the original CEO of Galapagos, Ono, uh, back in, uh, it was, I think early 2020 and he was so.\n\n00:47:39,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Excited about the deal they had done with Gilead, rightly so, because it had brought in, I think, it was like $5 billion in cash, but also he was fiercely committed to the idea of Galapagos as an independent platform company running forever. On its own two legs without being gobbled up by some form of behemoth. And the deal with Gilead, he was finally confident, had like forever secured. Galapagos' independence, that between the obligations to give Gilead U. S. rights for programs and the sort of standstills and things like that that stopped Gilead from being an acquirer, that the company was like assured its independence. I think one thing we can confidently say is that succeeded.\n\n00:48:21,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n And now, with the business largely no longer in any of that form, it still has all of these obligations that render it complex. And I think it's one of these things where, whatever, it's like a very beautiful picture of laws of unintended consequences where we now have this.\n\n00:48:40,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Through a shadow of its former self-organization with a whole bunch of cash that could be used productively.\n\n00:48:46,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Trapped in a sort of interstitial zone between public biotech companies.\n\n00:48:50,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n and Gilead affiliate, and I've just found it really interesting to watch from the outside Matt, do you think there was anything to do with the new head of CBER announcement who has been very clear about questions about cell therapy and particularly about using surrogate markers at least in some settings for approvals.\n\n00:49:14,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't know. I'm reading too much into it. It would surprise me a little bit if, look, I think. I think the path started with they decided to work on these cell therapy programs. Stoffels was really excited about them. The public markets.\n\n00:49:28,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n It has not been friendly to companies of that kind for a while, and so I think like they got on this path, and then they sort of realized we're going to fund this thing with 500 million dollars. It's going to need more than 500 million dollars. We're just like setting this thing up to have a difficult trajectory.\n\n00:49:43,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n Then Stoffel's left. Ah. And I think he left kind of before the seaboard change, I think, or maybe right around the same time, but it must have been planned for longer than that. And so, you know, I think the company was sort of left. A little bit leaderless, with a really tough market reception for a program that I don't think the street was particularly excited about for the most part.\n\n00:50:04,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um and then, it can't help that the stance on cell therapy gets even stricter and at a minimum is going to make this company even less popular as an independent public company. So I'm sure it was a notionally contributing factor, but I doubt it was the thing in and of itself.","char_start":45562,"char_end":49939,"start_time":"00:46:21","end_time":null}

So I'm sure it was a notionally contributing factor, but I doubt it was the thing in and of itself.\n\n00:50:20,970 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right, right. Now, so actually this brings us to other turnarounds, and one of them was Cytomics. Which, uh, presented some data for an EPCAM-directed ADC which, which has got a drop two on it, uh, sorry, summaries on it. And say, CX2051 market cap current is $312 million. The stock traded at 43 cents on the 7th of April. So whoever's out there who was brave to buy it at those prices should pat themselves on the back because current share price is $2, having touched $2.50. Because of relatively positive data that came out of this, and they immediately, at the back of it, raised $100 million.\n\n00:51:03,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n And this company had traded below cash for three years. Years right now, I think I think Galapagos probably beats it. I'm not sure. I haven't done the comparison, but this phase one data in late line CRC, according to our analysis, looks pretty good. And frankly, just in the third line market currently is worth about $1. 1 billion in the US. And there are products out there who are looking very good, but this brings a completely different mode of action. And of course, this is just CRC. Where else can it work? And it does use the cytomics technology. So it's nice to see companies be able to. In some cases, continue and actually deliver. This is technology that I think a lot of people had given up on.\n\n00:51:48,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, I want to concur with that. I mean, first of all, kudos to Sean McCarthy, who stuck with it all these years as the CEO.\n\n00:51:58,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n kept with it. And it's wonderful to see the result. And it's also wonderful to see the market respond to good data. So that's a piece of happiness in the week. There's no doubt about that.\n\n00:52:13,630 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and heavily pretreated CRC has been such a bear, and we're not seeing much of anything. And I think the other thing that the Cytomics did a good job of, I think, in reporting this, and the waterfall looks really quite nice with quite a few responders, is they also really helped to kind of re-elaborate some evidence base.\n\n00:52:33,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Epidemiology on FCAM and other solid tumors as well. So I think there's perhaps a little bit of reminiscence to the target, unlike the other one we'll talk about.\n\n00:52:43,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I suspect you'll need the pro body or masking or something to manage the AEs. And now we also had an M &A deal. For a company that was close to cash or below cash. John and Nina, did you want to talk about the Buy Marine, which was today or yesterday? I can't remember. Yeah.\n\n00:53:03,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, it was today, this morning. I don't know much about the Target company, but it was good to see Bob Morin out there, you know, executing on his business development objectives. James Sabry was brought in by Alexander Hardy, you know, a couple of years now, maybe a year ago. And he's doing his work. He's doing his job. He's going off fighting assets. And this certainly fits in the Biomarin story. So it was good to see them go out there, be a buyer and bring some technology and pipeline into the company.\n\n00:53:34,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, Nina.\n\n00:53:36,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Format I was going to make a remark across both of these situations, which is, as a public CEO, one of the things you start to feel is a little battered by the markets over time. And in particular, I feel like our industry operates at times like investors as a class are. The sort of ultimate tastemakers. And yet, I think if you look at many success stories in industry, they have stock charts that look like these two stock charts.

So the other deal that we had, which isn't quite an acquisition, it was GSK buying a drug from Boston. And that was a $1. 2 billion. dollars up front and 800 million dollars in contingent milestones. The drug is ephemotheramine, god— they're hard drugs. They're all they're from mash and liver issues. So and there are a couple of companies out there which are comparatively differently valued. So 89 Bio has got an enterprise value of 514 million with a drug in phase three. And Effie is in phase two. And there is a key role, of course, with $2.4 billion.\n\n00:54:59,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, with another similar drug, with uh, afroxylamine, it does also in phase three. There's been a lot of discussion along the clients that I've been tuned into about whether this is a good asset or not a good asset. What is interesting about it is that this second time that Glaxo has bought an asset or a drug or a company where the drug was licensed in. The last day was a drug that was licensed in like six months beforehand. From China this time and I can't remember the name of the company this time. It's been a while. It was 2020, I think, that this drug came from Novartis.\n\n00:55:34,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n Interesting that it fits in with the MASH franchise that I think GSK is trying to come into the well on RNA interference drug. In phase two also. We think the profile looks decent. I don't know if anybody else has had a look at it or thinks about this therapeutic area.\n\n00:55:50,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I think it looks decent as well. I think the FGF21 story is going to be an important part of the MASH story. There's no doubt about that. I also think it's great that MASH is becoming a new black all of a sudden after being very disfavored. Um, but we're seeing a lot. I think the magical success has been uh illuminating the commercial potential in the space and now we're seeing some exciting assets, um, like the FGF21 story and then some very exciting assets on the RNA interference side, including the program that GSK has got called targeting HSD17B13, which is a phenomenon. genetic target in MASH. So lots of fun there, I think, and lots of movement. And of course, the impact of glyphs in the space is also going to be important. So it's going to be fun to see this play out.\n\n00:56:43,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n Nina?\n\n00:56:45,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n Nothing to add.\n\n00:56:46,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. But, I mean, I think they might have used some computers to identify that genomic target. There might have been one or two. One or two.\n\n00:56:55,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hooked up to the internet. That's right, yeah.\n\n00:56:57,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, of course, talking about RNA interference, RNA, siRNA, et cetera, we had two deals this week.\n\n00:57:03,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n One with the US company, one with the South Korean company. And John, if anybody's got to talk about these things, it's got to be you.\n\n00:57:09,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n I guess so. I guess so. Well, you know, there were two interesting deals.\n\n00:57:15,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, one, I think, obviously, much, much bigger was the AbbVie partnership. With a private company called 8RX. And 8RX is a super cool company led by a former R &D person from- Arrowhead, female CEO, awesome leader. And they did a deal, $335 million upfront, with AbbVie. This is Abby's first jump into R & Ei as well, which is good to see. And obviously, a multi-target deal, from what I can lean from the press release, across multiple areas, immunology, oncology, neurology, were the areas that were noted in the press release.\n\n00:57:59,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n Good to see all that play out.\n\n00:58:02,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's obviously a good source of capital for 8RX. And the second deal, I know much less about. Arzinomics is the name of the company in South Korea. It seems to be around RNA editing, but unclear, I must say. From the press release, but it is in the field of hearing loss and that's an area that Lily of course has been um really keen on with some pretty impressive success through the gene therapy efforts.

So it might be a small deal, but it's good to see this deal making happening across the industry. And I'm always happy when it's happening in the R &A world.\n\n00:58:54,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, there's a whole bunch. Thank you, John, for that. There's a whole bunch of other comments, things that we could have talked about. But let me just do a round, Robin and Nina.\n\n00:59:05,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n Anything to add?\n\n00:59:06,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n Just wishing everyone a great weekend and continued good fight in delivering good things for patients.\n\n00:59:14,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n And let's hope that we don't have as eventful a Monday as we did this week. Matt?\n\n00:59:22,129 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm tempted to make some comment about On Island being a great company, but I'm good. No, this was a fun conversation. I appreciate it.

I'm Chris Garabedian, and my co-hosts today are Josh Schimmer, Michael Yee, Nina Shelson, and Tim Oppler. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout.com. So why don't we start with the breaking news that I think you know. Uh, social media is a buzz with the bio uh group on the summit. Data uh, summit last I checked was down almost 25 percent. Um, for missing overall survival, but the trend was in that direction. They hit on PFS, but it's raising a lot of broader questions about this drug, the target, the competition. Tim, you want to kick us off on that breaking news?\n\n00:00:50,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, I would say good news, bad news. The good news is that, I mean, this drug's associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of mortality in Western patients. So, like, if you ask me, you know, Would you pay money to take this drug? The answer is, heck yeah. If I had cancer, I'd be very interested in this drug. This should be a big drug. The bad news is that they missed their statistical significance on OS, but just barely. Like, it was 0.0575. So the trial was underpowered. That's all. And you know, you don't know till you know. And you've got to remember, this drug went very quickly into phase three. Someone was very aggressive in pursuing their phase three strategy. And so, you know, as often happens, you're probably going to have to go back and do some more work. And they have a bunch of studies underway, so that's going to happen naturally anyway.\n\n00:01:36,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and they communicated that they're not stopping in terms of engaging FDA on this. I think the bigger question is, does this make the product less competitive if they don't have the claims? There's been some question of whether FDA is going to set a higher bar with overall survival and needing to see that. And the idea that it opens up the door— for maybe some of the competitors, right— to argue that, you know, this isn't as special, right, as what they might be developing.\n\n00:02:06,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thoughts on that, or anybody else want to weigh in on this?\n\n00:02:09,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, just to comment, I think there's no question that VEGF PD-1 is going to become the backbone standard of care and oncology. It's going to be a huge category and yeah, it's going to be competitive as one would expect. And we're going to see a lot more innovation. I mean, we're not done with. This kind of area. So I would expect, in a lot of the evolution now, it's going to be how does this new backbone therapy get used in combination with various types of emerging ADCs like TRIP2.\n\n00:02:37,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep. Uh, Mike, Josh— do you guys want to comment on just the stock movement?\n\n00:02:41,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, Hey, it's Mike. Hopefully you can hear me. First is that, you know, there were super high expectations going on. So we have a disappointment there on the P value. Tim's totally right. You know, it didn't hit. Call a spade a spade. So unfortunately, that presents a decision to the FDA. To make a tough call because they're pretty clear that they do require OS. And so you can say it's close, but technically it didn't. So that's a tough spot they're in. And I think they've emphasized that. I would point out that. Um, I don't recall what the expectations are, but uh, Astro Dauchi have ditto DxD on for a July Paducah date, so in two months they do not have a stat sig OS as well. Um, so that's going to be interesting, but also let's also take a step back and remember that part of the uh read through here is that the Western and non-Western patient population basically align, and I think that that's also an important thing, although maybe people have gotten down right. The non-Chinese population was important; it was pretty identical, right?\n\n00:03:46,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n 0. 80. In the Chinese label versus 0. 7 I'm here.\n\n00:03:52,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep.\n\n00:03:54,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tim, I'm going to move up one topic you were going to touch on because it's somewhat related— is the Pfizer deal. Another China deal with 3S looking at getting a PD1 VEGF. Again, we just talked about the competition. You said this class is going to be huge.

Do you want to speak to that before we go into some of the market dynamics?\n\n00:04:13,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, so interesting, right? Because remember, Pfizer had partnered with Summit, and then they turned around and licensed in this 3S Bio.\n\n00:04:22,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Asset. I think some people are a little surprised by the high price, but actually, if you think of, you know, what I just said, how big the market is, maybe the price is low. Who knows? 3s Bios actually had really good data for their PD1 Veg App. It's not the same structure. And so, you know, Pfizer's bought C-Gen and now they have a backbone therapy. That they can use. They don't have to rely on someone else's clinical development for how they're going to develop all those C-Gen.\n\n00:04:47,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n ADCs with this new backbone. So I think very astute move by Pfizer. It's frankly surprising to me that some of the other players have not entered this space yet. Maybe this new data will accelerate that.\n\n00:05:00,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n Absolutely. Well, this was a big deal. But overall, I'd say over the last several years.\n\n00:05:07,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n M &A and these bigger deals has been pretty anemic, and I think we've all been waiting for it. They're generally is a Inverse correlation when the markets are down, then pharma and big biotech start to go shopping and you start to see more M &A, but that hasn't. really materialized. I know you study this week in and week out, Tim. uh what's the state of m a how how do you uh kind of read the tea leaves and you know everybody's expecting we're gonna see more and then you know rest of the year or second half but every time we predict that we're we fall short Right.\n\n00:05:40,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I was on a biotech hangout in sort of January, February, you know, with the benefit of being on the investment banking side. So obviously I have some visibility, not full visibility, but some into what big pharma is. Plans and intentions are, and I was saying, we're going to see a lot of MA in 2025. Well, now it's you know, almost June, and it's not been nearly the level that I would have expected. And there's a very simple explanation, and that starts in the White House, right? So Liberation Day plus MFN plus, you know, overall uncertainty in the macro environment, I think, has caused pharma to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is not the time to go take, you know, our balance sheet.' And spend it. So there's incredible uncertainty, and that uncertainty I hope will start to get resolved. As these tariff conversations get resolved in July. But candidly, at this point, I don't. So we're just going to have to see.\n\n00:06:36,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n We had actually done an analysis.\n\n00:06:39,290 [SPEAKER_4]\n Pharma M&A trends and patterns. If you kind of look at the filings and the projected revenue numbers that the acquirers are laying out as part of the deal.\n\n00:06:52,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n Those tend to be about. 25 above the sell-side consensus numbers as as these kinds of assets run their course. And by the way, those sell-side consensus numbers tend to be 25% above. Reality, right. So basically, the firm is on on average paying or or attributing 50% too much success on a revenue basis in their projections. And that creates all sorts of issues and distortions because one might look at that and suggest that The companies that may be most worried about hitting the sell-side consensus numbers are the companies that may be most willing to sell and most likely to be acquired. But that is completely antithetical to every investor's general approach, which is to try to find those companies where you think the consensus numbers are actually too low. So, you know, we kind of always fall back into the question: 'When is the M&A going to happen?' 'When is the M&A going to happen?' I can't even remember the last time M&A occurred in such a substantial wave as to impact the sector more broadly as opposed to just being a very lucky handful of companies every year that get acquired.","char_start":4201,"char_end":8451,"start_time":"00:04:13","end_time":null}

The problem is, there are just too many of those companies out there to go and anticipate which one is going to be bought. So we kind of keep falling back into this trap of 'When's the M&A coming? When's the M&A coming? My point is, it doesn't matter.\n\n00:08:37,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I wonder, I want to share a couple factors that might be driving this. So, you know, when I used to and to analyze M &A targets for Gilead, Celgene, right across my career. You know, there are two factors that we would consider. One is scarcity value. Is this the only game in town, right? And I wonder, we'll touch on a little bit the crowding around targets, whether it's cardiometabolic, whether it's PD-1/ VEGF, whether it's just the idea that in the China trade of being able to access other similar drugs for the pipeline. The scarcity value is few and far between. And then you also have to consider, is this going to run away? Is the valuations going to get too rich and we better strike now? Is it possible that there's just less concern about scarcity value and also less concern that valuations are going to start ticking up very quickly and start to become overpriced? I wonder if that's creating a little bit.\n\n00:09:39,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, of this Paul over kind of the lack of urgency around M&A from you know, pharma biotech. Any thoughts?\n\n00:09:50,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n What about the idea that, in the past month or two, we have seen early, early promising signs from the fact that small companies that don't have a lot of money ultimately build. Uh, Awesome. And you had a couple of privates last two weeks. A billion dollars for a private company. Yeah, that's the first milestone, buying a single billion dollars. Uh and then you had the rumblings of a tarot last week. So, um, you know, I'm not sure necessarily someone was thinking blueprint or something bigger, but you did have some early things going on and some early rumblings which I thought was promising because it does take a couple months for things to settle out. You have their earlier, more desperate companies that are willing to to go first, and I thought that was promising. No.\n\n00:10:44,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n And then, how many companies have been rumored to be M &A targets that just have not materialized as M &A targets? So again, it may happen, it may not happen. It doesn't matter because it can't shape your investment decision process.\n\n00:10:57,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I do think the bright spot is that looking at deals that are earlier. Maybe even pre-clinical proof of concept, where, look, I mean, these companies have huge balance sheets. They can use their currency. And, you know, I think it's a smart. Strategy to kind of do a little bit of a land grab and help your early pipeline, knowing that everything may not work. And Nina, I know on the venture side, we all are hoping for more of that to potentially exit some of our portfolio companies or programs before you have to read out that clinical.\n\n00:11:30,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, any thoughts?","char_start":8151,"char_end":11736,"start_time":"00:08:06","end_time":null}

You know, phase two and phase three are still not the easiest, although there's so much more capital on the private side now than, say, 10 years ago. It's still, you know, it's a long timeline and it's a large nut to be able to run those. Those studies. But I still think, you know, the point about sort of scarcity value and sort of competitive pressure is, I think, the one that rules the day. Because I think the reason for pharma to come earlier is if they believe they'll be outcompeted or outbid if they wait. And I think that's a good strategy, but you don't necessarily want to be the only bidder for that phase one pre-POC. Uh, asset. Um, you can spend a lot of time doing diligence getting to know it, and then still decide to stay on the sidelines until the next card is is turned over. In an environment where the capital markets are so tough, where the crossovers have basically left the early clinical to preclinical space, and where the IPO window is, for all intents and purposes, closed.\n\n00:12:37,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's really no pressure forcing urgency or forcing pharma's hand. So I can understand why there's a wait and see.\n\n00:12:45,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thank you. Yeah, we still see the most elusive deal right now is the Series B to get through a clinical proof of concept, even though there's many, many programs that might be deserving of that. And it is a trickle down, right? I mean, the crossovers were filling that gap. For many years, but Tim just. You know we know venture lags kind of what's going on in the public markets and the hedge funds, and what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics of this downturn? Kind of when it might end.\n\n00:13:11,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, it's a great question. And just to touch a little bit more on M &A, and I don't know how encouraging this will be, but it reflects the reality. Coming into this year, you know, again, I'm like a practicing investment banker. I'm, you know, one of many. So I don't want to exaggerate. And you know, anything about my own perspective. But I would say that I had a pretty balanced book of M &A projects, some for big pharma, some for smaller and mid-sized pharma. At the moment, I'm working on a record volume of M &A deals. They're all commercial, like every single change of control transaction I'm working on, and there's a lot of them. They're all commercial stage. So buyers right now are looking at the hundreds of commercial stage companies. You know, there's so many biotechs that got their drug approved.\n\n00:13:58,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n And they're just not trading it very.\n\n00:14:01,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n Good prices. And so, from a buyer's perspective, you know, why would you buy the phase two when you can go and buy the commercial asset? And so, you know, for the R &D stage companies, especially, you know, the quality companies that are in your portfolio or Nina's portfolio or others. They really have to have something that is exceptional, that's going to change the standard of care in some important area of medicine. And by definition, there just aren't that many of those companies. I think that's part of the explanation of what's. what's going on on the M &A side.\n\n00:14:32,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Tim, for as long as you and I have been in the business, you know, the 25 years that I've been in the mantra of, you know. 'Buy the news, sell the launch,' right?\n\n00:14:42,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n or by the approvals, short the launch. I think the fact is. Aside from perhaps orphan rare, we in biotech and small to mid-cap companies are notoriously terrible at commercializing our assets. Often will trade or be valued at even less than our phase two, you know, post POC stage. So it's also a nice value, a de-risked value shopping opportunity for pharma.\n\n00:15:10,229 [SPEAKER_1]\n And ways to amortize, obviously, existing commercial infrastructure with nice little tuck-ins.","char_start":11436,"char_end":15693,"start_time":"00:11:30","end_time":null}

And some of it is pretty chunky. And so I think it's going to be an interesting year. Here. In the past, I've likened the current period to sort of when Reagan was elected. Of course, Donald Trump is not Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan isn't Donald Trump. But there are a lot of similarities and parallels between the macro situations for the end of inflation, a recovery of the economy, this tremendous uncertainty, very divided country. And what you saw from like 1982 to 1988 was a ton of commercial acquisitions.\n\n00:15:51,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n Those commercial companies don't get fully valued until the market's really recovered for quite a while.\n\n00:15:58,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n Chris, I didn't answer your question on sort of hedge funds and macro. So look, sentiment is not good. I'd love to hear what others like Mike and Josh have to say. You know, the XBI is under 80 today and investors are really kind of freaked out about the macro picture. In that people, you know, before were worried about inflation and rates. Today's inflation number was fantastic, actually. But now people are just very worried about what's going to happen to this industry with President Trump in office and his ideas, and the RFK and his ideas. And I do hope that this gets cleared up in the next two or three months and things start to recover.\n\n00:16:38,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I want to go to Mike in a minute. But before we do that, I wanted to highlight. So Endpoints has done this biannual survey. On kind of sentiment across a lot of variables, but they have a pretty consistent question around the market conditions, both private and public, and I just want to share. So the latest survey, which was posted a week or so ago, and they did a video analysis that was posted the other day, but they were the worst. Uh, sentiments around the market financing environment than they have had in their history of the survey and it goes back many many years. I I have participated as one of the survey respondents, but just to share some of these data. Uh, you know, the question about how would you rate the flow of investments from venture groups today: 59%. Rated it the worst in terms of poor, and 90% said it's poor or fair. So they had the lowest percentage of respondents that said the VC flow of investments is good or fair.\n\n00:17:40,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n On the IPO front, also the worst in their history of the search. Survey, 94% said the state of biotech IPOs and follow-on markets is poor, 6% said fair, and nobody said anything positive about the state of that. Accessing capital, and these are specific CEOs who may be having some favorable response to their specific company. But basically, the worst ratings they had previously were in 2022 and 2023, the first half of about 10 or 11 percent that said it was not at all confident. This was three times. that not at all confident sentiment. Uh, than the worst ratings they had previously, uh, and again, uh, well over uh 50 were saying not at all confident or somewhat, um, and then uh, you know, the last one was biotech valuations, was also rated the worst with uh, the fewest, um, stating that the valuations are average or high, very high.\n\n00:18:45,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n So again, almost 90% said it was low or very low in terms of valuation. So just to give that snapshot, just done a couple of weeks ago. Uh, it feels like the sentiment has capitulated, like we see stocks. And hopefully that's a sign that we truly have hit rock bottom and we have only one way to go up. But Michael, how do you see this? I think you also saw those survey results.","char_start":15393,"char_end":19349,"start_time":"00:15:10","end_time":null}

But Michael, how do you see this? I think you also saw those survey results.\n\n00:19:13,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I did see those results. And so we start with the context since we're supposed to be investors, right? That if the valuations are low. Although they've been low for a while, and everybody's very negative, that that has been largely reflected and everybody knows that. And quite honestly, I feel like every uh hangout is more about 'when will things start to turn not necessarily get worse, start to turn up, and I do feel like we've just been sort of bouncing around. Bouncing around, Although, again, I think at the start of the year, guys, we did have a nice rally. And we just sort of came down mostly because of the tariff stuff, the markets. And really, FDA and CBER, the day Rene came in, I think the XBI was down 7% that day, right? And so that has been a real sort of hit to us. And I just wanted to say that.\n\n00:20:05,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n In reflecting on that survey, I'm hopeful that at least in Smid Bio, that I feel like, while things are tough in the market, stuff for sure, that people definitely have been quite bearish on the regulatory environment. What's going to happen with all these innovative companies that Vinay and Marty are going around trying to potentially ease people and make people feel better about things. I was mentioning that Marty was at Marty's going to be at the Japanese healthcare conference next week on a fireside. And Vinay was at the Goldman thing last week. And so they are trying to ease people's concerns a bit. Obviously, the rubber needs to hit the road and we need to see pedophiles and things. And people are very nervous about the environment. And so I would like to see that part get better for people to feel a bit better about Smithi. I don't know whether it could be.\n\n00:20:54,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I would say, you know, a couple of things, you know, one, even before the macro uncertainty of the administration sort of. Maha and FDA, CDC, NIH agenda, and even with a backdrop of inflation and rates in that part of last year and coming into the new year. I do think that we had some more iatrogenic issues in biotech and that we had an awful lot of companies that got funded. With perhaps not enough substrate to build long-term sustainable companies versus really good trades. And I like the point that Tim made earlier about the crowding around targets and the challenges. I think that was Tim. around picking a winner. And when you're not so flushed that you can just build your basket around every kinase target or novel checkpoint. and have to be more selective. It's awfully hard to tell companies. But one of the things that strikes me that we're also going through now is a bit of a shakeout.\n\n00:21:57,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, we were going to talk a little later, perhaps, about ITOs, which was on the agenda to touch on a couple of weeks ago after they got their tidget back from GSK.\n\n00:22:07,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n And with it, the future prospects of additional cash milestones. But within two weeks of that announcement and the board declaring that they were going to to do the requisite exploration of strategic options, they decided to actually wind down the company and dividend out that cash, sort of following the path of Alicos and Kronos and Third Harmonic. And these are companies with exceptional management teams. In the case of ITOs, over 600 million. In cash and the the boards really voted with their with their wallets to say there is nothing of adequate value, public or private. To acquire or merge with in order to try to create a better return of investment than just dividend out that cash. And that's a pretty interesting statement and probably some necessary pain. To reduce the denominator of the number of publicly traded biotech companies that investors have to choose among. And there were a handful of VCs that were still or sort of crossovers that were still in ITOs, for example.","char_start":19049,"char_end":23252,"start_time":"00:19:13","end_time":null}

And there were a handful of VCs that were still or sort of crossovers that were still in ITOs, for example.\n\n00:23:11,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it wasn't just a matter of mutual funds. Um. The only negative of a silver lining to that, of course, a tragedy other than the disappointment on the science side. Is in the case of ITOs, it's almost 175 people. who will be looking for work and for whom we will need to have open doors for opportunities and ideas and support.\n\n00:23:37,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, Nina, is it a bad sign that they decided to return the money rather than merge with another company that needs the money, including companies that those VCs were already involved in, because you can't really go public? or that they said, 'We do that' but we don't want to be public because it's not good to be public right now. And so they did not. How do you think about that? Is that good or bad?\n\n00:23:58,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n We would have had a number of potential candidates lined up to knock on that door and others because it's not so much a desire to be public as it is a desire to access. You know, tens to hundreds of millions of dollars of of balance sheet to advance our private company's pipelines. So I think that the the target universe is sizable. I think the challenges are to the extent that there needs to be a coincident pipe. That pipe market hasn't been there. There hasn't been any interest in that piece. And then, you know, the other, if you don't feel confident that you're going to get shareholder support. And if there's a constituency among the holders that say, 'I would rather have my cash and to decide myself where to put it or place it elsewhere. Sit on it until greener pastures, then you're not going to get that deal done anyway.' And I think, from our vantage point, that's been the truth in a number of reverse merger efforts. There's been interest by— by the acquirer— uh and by the board to do it, but there's not been a conviction in the pipe.\n\n00:25:05,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n Right. Everyone has to agree and be behind it. And if it's not, it's not. Exactly.\n\n00:25:12,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n Exactly.\n\n00:25:12,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I still think there's also this sentiment that it's not. Great to be public right now. Nina, you said earlier, there's a lot of dry powder in the private equity markets that can support the right program. And so you've got a lot of companies that are legacy public, right. And they're challenged with market cap. And, but, you know, I think ITOs is a good poster child, at least this week on. You know, the exuberance around certain targets that don't fully play out to, you know, being a, you know, another example of this. But and I think Bruce Booth had a really good blog post called 'The Wisdom of Crowds' and how he's basically saying that the crowding around certain targets is a feature, not a bug, and he draws the parallel parallels to tech where, you know, a good idea in tech gets crowded around and they realize that there's only going to be one or two leaders that emerge and he's suggesting that biotech is very different. You're going to take a lot longer to figure out if the excitement around certain targets are going to play out in the clinic and who's going to be differentiated and what those data sets look like versus you might find that out in a much more accelerated fashion in the tech.\n\n00:26:23,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n But kind of a good idea and I guess a defense of the crowding around targets. He gives a lot of examples of, you know, specific targets where there's, you know, literally 100, 150 programs that are going on. And not all of those are going to be winners.\n\n00:26:40,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n Before we move on.","char_start":22952,"char_end":26842,"start_time":"00:23:11","end_time":null}

I would just say, with some of these targets, and much appreciation to Bruce for generating constantly such a thoughtful content into our. into our sphere. Um, but you know, I think with with a tidget, it's sort of like that went the way of the PD1s that it's an obligate combination asset, it's not expected to have mono therapy efficacy, and it's about, you know, destiny control. So unfortunately, in our industry, the good news is sometimes second or third in class can be quite big, but in some categories, you know, in combination chemo, combination IO, you've just got to have control of your.\n\n00:27:17,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n of your own. I like how we go from lamenting the lack of capital to applauding the absolute ridiculous redundancy around the same target with the capital that we do have. Brilliant.\n\n00:27:30,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, he does reference the whole first in class versus best in class. And essentially, you know, you call anything best in class if you're not first and, you know. the higher risk reward that comes with that. So, I mean, we're all guilty of.\n\n00:27:44,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would also suggest that maybe public market investors are going to have a very different view than the venture capital investors about that same topic.\n\n00:27:54,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Yeah. Dirt. They're complementary and and somewhat at odds in terms of how they're babies.\n\n00:28:00,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n And to be fair to Bruce, it was actually a very balanced dialogue. He wasn't just saying, 'Crowding is an amazing thing,' he did recognize the deficiencies that arise from overcrowding.\n\n00:28:15,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n Absolutely, yeah, it was a thoughtful piece and I, you know, when I look back, I mean Bruce has been doing these back to 2011 and so again, just credit that he constantly uh is thoughtful, you know, writes these pieces well, and definitely anybody who's early in their career in biotech should, you know, definitely be consuming that, those blog posts. All right, let's move on. A little bit more to the policy.\n\n00:28:38,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n Nina, Michael, you know, there's been more coming out of HHS, you know, COVID vaccine recommendations. A cut to Moderna on pandemic flus. So, you know, some of the policy positions are playing out in terms of, you know, kind of real action here. Nina, you want to start?\n\n00:28:59,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and obviously, you know, we touch on the policy stuff, right, because it speaks to, you know, NIH funding available for early stage research, the regulators focus on various modalities and indications. And then obviously, and very significantly in the last couple of weeks, for vaccines. And that all to circle back to Tim's earlier point, obviously also influences the sort of the generalist sentiment and public market sentiment on our. our industry. but we had sort of two, two and a half major things come down. One, just touch on it super quickly, is the drop on the 22nd of May of the Maha Make America Healthy Again report by RFK and flanked by Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Macri, I think, signaling significant.\n\n00:29:49,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n sort of mutual support there for the thesis and this is really sort of following on. on the executive order but um But the things that were striking was a very singular focus on the root causes and strategies for improving the health of American kids, particularly concerned about chronic illnesses, obesity, diabetes.\n\n00:30:12,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n of course, RFK, autism as well, and then mental health disorders, depression, anxiety. Um, and a real focus on kind of over medicalization and and inadequate sort of surveillance of post-marketing experience with medications, but then also really wanting to look at study of nutrition and diet, environmental toxins, PFAS, and grass excipients, which is where it really touches FDA.","char_start":26542,"char_end":30748,"start_time":"00:26:40","end_time":null}

You know, surprisingly absent from something talking about childhood and adolescent health and mental health in particular was any focus on social media, screen time, which was big under the last administration, and then obviously also alcohol, tobacco, and other illicit substances. Um, the read-through I think that's significant is probably a greater scrutiny on childhood vaccines, and that'll tie into both CDC and FDA, as well as some public health education around chronic disease prevention. Uh, for NIH, there's a through line, and this is, I think, a very strong priority for Dr. Bhattacharya at NIH as well. is sort of the crisis in replication in in scientific data and the concerns about how much research actually cannot be reproduced and that leads to mis-and disinformation. And misaligned funding, as well as NIH pivoting some of their research agendas to chronic health and nutrition.\n\n00:31:50,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n And then on FDA, grass for additives in food and even medication, and then also childhood vaccines.\n\n00:32:01,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n So that's kind of maha and maha will play play out yeah and nina.\n\n00:32:05,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n How I haven't downloaded the report. How extensive and uh lengthy was that uh that you got through. Or is it a hundred pages?\n\n00:32:13,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no, it's over a hundred page document with citations, many of which have now been shown to be misgenerated by AI. So there's been a little bit of heat to the administration for. for that.\n\n00:32:27,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. And I know one of the things, obviously, besides the Moderna HHS cuts to that, that's a clear signal of, you know, the regime that was kind of applauded. you know, glorified during the COVID vaccines are, you know, the blooms off the rose there for a lot of those companies.\n\n00:32:44,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, there's sort of new FDA guidelines or guardrails as it relates to both COVID and flu vaccines, most notably wanting to see placebo-controlled trials for vaccines that would be commercialized to the under 65. Um, population. Now, this begs a lot of questions about how you will do placebo-controlled trials in healthy and minimally symptomatic flu and COVID individuals. But the other emphasis is looking at endpoints of relevance, so not just your— you know, viral titers confirmed by lab or your patient or clinician reported symptoms, but actual hospitalization and deaths— as being sort of the only real prophylactic justification for vaccinating in those populations. And the read-through to Moderna, you know, is whether or not, with their Um, you know, bifunctional flu COVID vaccine, whether or not in particular they're going to have to do prospective phase three placebo-controlled studies in the 50 to 65 year old population.\n\n00:33:52,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n And they withdrew their BLA and they plan to refile next year. But that's a little bit of overhang for them. And then, of course, the bigger overhang was the NIH's decision to stop supporting an mRNA vaccine for. for avian flu. which continues to be a really big problem. 50, 60,000 chickens, 50, 60 million chickens have been killed in the last three months to prevent transmission. But on the other hand, bird flu is 70, 80 cases in humans, but it's not particularly pathogenic in humans or of great concern. So it may be a decision to say that that juice isn't worth the squeeze, although it's about 750 million bucks to Moderna. So definitely some juice squeezing there.\n\n00:34:40,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, one thing I saw Makary comment on, which I think is a thoughtful perspective, is when you do the studies, the actual respiratory pathogen can evolve. and cannot be as relevant for the way the initial studies were. And it seemed like he was trying to figure out how to solve for that, which I don't know it's an easy, easy solve, but. The COVID that we're dealing with now is very different than the COVID when the original vaccines and boosters were developed. And so, at least, they're putting some energy and attention into what is most relevant for the pathogen that might be circulating.","char_start":30448,"char_end":34933,"start_time":"00:30:40","end_time":null}

And that's fair for bird flu, too. There's been a couple of new strains that have emerged there as well. But I think the the rationale for particularly mRNA vaccines is that it can follow a little bit like flu, that there's a point in time where and expert counsel deems such and such strains to be those most virulent, most relevant for a particular season.\n\n00:35:47,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n Isn't a requirement to do, you know, forward protection studies. Just plug in the sequence. You know, the safety's there. Yeah. Now, the question, I think, is whether or not, and this is mentioned in the CDC. Um, the statement is whether or not the same seasonality applies to COVID as it does to flu, and COVID can be pretty active in the summer months as well. So is there that same sort of opportunity to pick and pivot?\n\n00:36:15,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, Michael. You want to comment anything further on the on the policy side?\n\n00:36:19,635 [SPEAKER_0]\n From the biotech side, I mean, I read over the Maha report and I think a lot of it focuses on things that are food, agriculture, et cetera, et cetera. And so that has been a historic big focus point for them. And I'm not too overly concerned about that. And the biotech stuff, yes, the vaccines part, which is still a bit of a niche area for biotech overall, is definitely under siege. I think that's pretty clear. It's going to continue to be very difficult for the Moderna team and others to navigate that as an executive team and as an R &D investment decision team. How do you make decisions and where we're allocating capital? And by the way, Moderna has a due for date, I think on Monday or falls on the weekend. So we may hear from them today, by the way, on the new. Moderna bivalent vaccine that has a fedufidate for the refrigerator safe version one. So let's wait to hear from that, ironically. And then, yeah.\n\n00:37:20,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n How do you decide what to do with this flu COVID thing? So this is very difficult in that whole area. And it's pretty clear that Marty and the others are going to make it pretty difficult for new vaccines. So that's why I go back to. What does it mean for this administration and for us? How are these things going to shape the regulatory approval for new broad expansion drugs, new. Rare disease drugs, new autoimmune drugs, per se, and I'm hopeful that over the next six months we find out that it's not too abrasive for that area which we're primarily focused on. So yeah, Michael. The Gilead Padufa date is that—A is that a signal that we should be looking at? Thank you, thank you. So I believe that, well, I would think most of my peers here agree that PDUFA dates going well are a good thing and says that we're along the right track. It's pretty hard to invest if you can't even get the PDUFA dates going. And June 19th is the Gilead. Breakthrough therapy, Pidufidate for the Lenacaprevir. HIV prep drug, the once every six month injection for the 99/ 100 prevention of HIV, which I think everyone in biotech agrees is pretty overwhelmingly obviously positive and risk-benefit.","char_start":34633,"char_end":38055,"start_time":"00:35:13","end_time":null}

We want to make sure that there's no FDA delays, resources, or otherwise, right? A lot of headcount and doge concerns. Number two. Uh, that it was a very fast review within six months, so can they do this all in six months? Number three: it's kind of the only big pedophilic that I'm aware of this year that impacts up to a million people and kind of that scene, like where McPerry and others have been very focused on these big markets. Where do we have enough safety? Do we have enough phase four safety? What does the safety database look like where you find these other things that pop up, like myocarditis in the vaccine later on? And so I'm a little bit nervous. about whether they make this difficult or not and so I do think it's a it's an important barometer to make sure everything's okay add to the fact that I don't want to spend a lot of time on on RFK's book and the comments about HIV which sort of adds a whole other around to this so looking for positive things and I I do think biotech would like to see that go right Excellent.\n\n00:39:31,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, so let's move to the data front—uh, what's been happening this week—uh, again, uh, some not so great news. Do you want to provide an update on that?\n\n00:39:46,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Hey, Chris, while we're waiting on Josh, I wanted to comment a little bit on Mike's comments. Yeah, please. Mike, I really like what you just said. And I also like what you said when you were talking about Moderna versus BioNTech on a previous episode. He kind of noted how different the investment decisions were between the two companies coming out of the pandemic. And, you know, I don't think at that point we would have anticipated what has happened with the Trump administration vaccines.\n\n00:40:13,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n But boy, I mean. You know, you really feel for Moderna in a way that they've had to farm on vaccines and now they're facing this administration. And I personally just wish them well and hope that they can.\n\n00:40:27,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n Kind of figure out how to get their pretty interesting portfolio.\n\n00:40:32,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n Through the FDA, and I do worry about what's going to happen with that company. The other thing I wanted to say about the Maha, go ahead.\n\n00:40:41,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n It is quite striking, right, Tim? We talked about how it was a complete divergence of one company, which is all in, all in on respiratory vaccines, all in. And the other company pivots to being all in on cancer, including, by the way, VEGF and PD-1.\n\n00:40:58,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n And you couldn't have called opposite direction. So I do feel bad. And I hope and I'm telling you, from investor feedback, that Moderna, with all due respect to these guys, everyone's got a lot of respect for them. That they got to make some tough decisions, right because they're burning a lot of cash, and are they going to continue down that path? Are we going to have to make tough decisions? Give me a mind.\n\n00:41:17,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, for a $10 billion market cap company to be burning almost $4 billion a year is tough.\n\n00:41:25,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's tough. You've got to make some decisions.\n\n00:41:28,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, they're sitting on $8 billion in cash, but who knows?\n\n00:41:33,369 [SPEAKER_3]\n What's going to play out there. I mean, they could end up. They're not careful— you know, being the next bluebird.\n\n00:41:40,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n There are probably a couple of venture firms they could acquire.\n\n00:41:43,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n There you go.\n\n00:41:46,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right. Well, let's, Josh. I didn't realize dropped off. So we'll come back to a couple of topics if he comes back.\n\n00:41:51,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n And Chris, I wanted to make one other comment coming back to to the very nice comments.

You know, for whatever reason, RFK is very focused on autism. I don't know if maybe he has personally been impacted by the disease through his family or something. I don't know. But what I can say is I'm personally fairly connected into the KOL community. In autism, and they are talking to the right people, so you know, sometimes he sounds a little bit loopy when he starts going on about autism, but they— They're serious— and autism is, as was pointed out in the Maha report, a very consequential disease. doesn't get a ton of attention from our industry. And I would hope that maybe all of this will cause more investment to go into that field.\n\n00:42:52,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, you know, it's interesting. Every company with this kind of regime change and different priorities, you know, many of our portfolio companies are seeing this as an opportunity to engage with the kind of new leadership and maybe has a technology, maybe in the pediatric, we have a company that's in the NICU, right? And the idea that you know, hey, this might be even more favored. Right. Um, and you know, if you're safe and all of that, and you can do the right studies, so again, for every company that might be groaning, right, of this being a more difficult pathway, I think there are companies that are seeing this as opportunistic to try to work with the new leadership, you know, just following on the point of your, your kind of autism focus.\n\n00:43:36,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. Yeah. Chris, I think it's, I think it's very much a both. And I, I think it is an opportunity for shining a brighter light on. Etiology of autism, hopefully. Hypotheses much broader than than vaccine or vaccine adjuvant. Um and to look at an improved access of care there. While also, I think it's really important, you know, quote unquote, vaccine's a pretty good idea. That we stand for vaccine prophylaxis where appropriate and building the evidence base that supports that as well, which prompts me to say I do think the administration, particularly at the FDA and at NIH, are very keen to hear feedback. We as an industry, certainly this is true of my portfolio companies, are very shy to go on the record with constructive criticism or feedback. To the agency.\n\n00:44:32,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Because there is a fear that that might be taken down as a note and come back and bite you later. But there is a very ardent effort underway through bio. to help stakeholders to help private and public companies find audience on a listening tour with Martin McCary and other members of FDA. So if you haven't caught wind of that, please feel free to DM or reach out to me and I can help facilitate because I think it's really important that we. that we provide. you know thoughtful, you know anecdotal, you know genuine input here.\n\n00:45:07,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Nina, I 100% agree with that. And shame on us if we're too afraid to give constructive feedback. The fact that they're asking and they're going on a listening tour. I mean, I think as long as it's constructive and not like antagonistic, et cetera, I think they're really. want to understand the perspectives and I think the companies that lean into that actually have a chance to do better. Because they give that feedback and they might be listened to. So yeah, I don't think we should adopt that, oh, we might upset somebody and they might come back to bite us later.\n\n00:45:38,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and we forget sometimes when we're in it how complex our industry is. And even people as sophisticated as those who've come into these leadership roles, they will not know everything about drug discovery and development.\n\n00:45:52,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's move to some data readouts. Nina, you want to start with Prothena, and then I think Mike and Tim might comment as well.\n\n00:46:05,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Or anybody, Anita, you're on mute.","char_start":41786,"char_end":45977,"start_time":"00:41:51","end_time":null}

I mean, I cover Protina. I've covered them for maybe a decade. And what a rise and fall. And rise and fall and rise and fall and now we're four bucks or whatever. But this was a five years ago, a very, very big situation with this antibody. Or AL amyloidosis, light chain amyloidosis. Not TTRM lethargy, and they were supposed to be positive. Seven years ago, it stopped at a futility analysis and failed miserably. On a fertility, you know those. And they found a subgroup analysis years later, redid the study again based on the subgroup, and here again, failed again.\n\n00:46:49,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n So it's just been a very tough situation for them. It was a major phase three cardiovascular amyloidosis readout. And sort of go back to, well, man. Uh, bit us again when you do a subgroup analysis post hoc. Here we go again. And well, didn't work again. So, that was a big news. Uh, and um, obviously, again, another stock that came below cash, and they've also said that they are evaluating all scenarios because I think they're sitting on about 300 million in cash. When the stock gets below Wow. Nina, you want to comment?\n\n00:47:28,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, sorry. I couldn't get my my mic back back on. You know, I would, I would just say that that I do think it's an unfortunate. And sort of spectacular phase three CEPAC for Prothenia. But I think that there is still a fundamental thesis in AL amyloidosis, and it may not have been the perfect antibody for that indication. It wasn't quite designed to go after.\n\n00:47:55,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n ALA, but rather SAA. So that, combined with some patient-to-patient variability in the trial, with respect to protein, probably suggests that there's still a worthy hypothesis to test here in going after this indication and this protein aggregate with an antibody.\n\n00:48:16,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Nina, I want to touch on, we always get these news events that give some hope to those who are focused on infectious antibiotics.\n\n00:48:25,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Spiro was one of those companies that was formed during the. the boom times. to focus on antibiotics. And it's been a really big challenge to invest in that area as venture, but they had a phase three data readout and a GSK deal. You want to speak to that?\n\n00:48:40,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Maybe what it sends a signal for or not.\n\n00:48:44,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'm not sure about signaling, but as someone who's made some nice returns in anti-infectives and as a citizen has lamented the fact that we don't have more development in antibiotics, given the perniciousness of drug resistance. I was kind of happy to see this. Neat on a couple of fronts. One, Sparrow's got an oral carbapenem. It might prove to be the first oral carbapenem, which is which is exciting. And they had a partnership with GSK to develop this in complicated UTI. This is hospitalized. population. So one of the slivers where anti-infective development is particularly challenged is for the hospital marketplace, because hospital formularies make market access so challenging. That the ROI for a venture investment is tough, but they've done a nice job here. And they actually stopped a 2,000 patient study early, a placebo-controlled study, and hit non-inferiority.\n\n00:49:46,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n And the data safety monitoring board said, 'Hey, you guys are good to go without enrolling further,' which is nice. And so GSK will owe them $150 million milestone for. For that, and Spiro just soared as a consequence. I think when I last looked at it, it was up 215%. So good on them for sure. Um, and GSK obviously remains a company that's still in the game of anti-infectives. They have a Um, I recently launched an uncomplicated UTI drug called Bejugo. That's a novel mechanism. And they really took that from bench to bedside.","char_start":45677,"char_end":49835,"start_time":"00:45:52","end_time":null}

And they really took that from bench to bedside.\n\n00:50:26,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n So Nina, I mean, as, as venture investors, right. I mean, one of the things that, you know, we have to look at is how many. And what natural acquirers are there for M&A? And what does the IPO market show in terms of comparables for, and this is why I think a lot of VCs do shy away from anti-infectives and antibiotics, where, I mean, people are still pointing to Cubist being acquired by Merck, right, back in the day. And so, like, how much does that— on even if someone sees a great technology, the fact that the odds of not having many natural acquirers and not having great comps on the IPO market weigh in the decision not to invest. In cutting edge anti-infectives.\n\n00:51:06,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I think that is the huge barrier. I mean, anti-infectives have a much higher probability of successful translation once you're through. Phase one safety and don't have anything untoward or unexpected, your likelihood of in vitro microbiology translating to clinical is higher than in pretty much any other indication. And the actual epidemiology would suggest that the unmet need is quite high. If you've ever had a loved one suffer from an intractable infection and go through second and third antibiotic and go from oral to IV and maybe even from outpatient to inpatient, you know that we need more armamentarium than than we have. But it's just really tough to make that case.\n\n00:51:49,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's been a lot of initiative, I sound like a policy wonk again, but there's been a lot of initiative historically to make the FDA more flexible on superiority versus non-inferiority margins. And we also benefited for a while from pretty significant BARDA funding to support development here. And those are intangibles that can make the risk a little bit, you know. easier to take.\n\n00:52:15,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, it does also— you wonder if the new administration, if they're waiting less vaccines as a preventive vis-a-vis the risk-benefit, are they going to start to realize, well, we do need therapies and treatments and we need to incentivize that for when people do contract these infectious diseases if there's going to be less preventive. So it'll be interesting, their ultimate policy position on this category. So, Nina, Josh was going to, I don't think we're going to get Josh back, but he was going to highlight Gilgamesh and the kind of boom in psychedelic, in the psychedelic space. And I know you've been following that as well and have some comments. Do you want to comment on just any of the news coming out of the psychedelic space?\n\n00:52:58,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, I wish I could say I've been following that space. No, I was very keen for Josh to educate and inform us. I had just taken note of a recent print last week of of the norex founders, um, coming at it again with a venture private company with some strategic, you know, lillian and abbott money, uh, to do the next gen, um, NMDA PAMS, so sort of small molecule with somewhat of an analogous mechanism of action as the psychedelics. But I would have to defer to smarter, groovier people to take the.\n\n00:53:32,459 [SPEAKER_1]\n The psychedelic question.\n\n00:53:33,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, if anybody wants to touch on the Gilgamesh news, feel free to weigh in. But I mean, here's the thing. This is one of the areas that RFK Jr. signaled part of the mental health, but he and part of his platform was highlighting that and we're seeing the investment. kind of follow in that space. It'll be interesting to see how that sector evolves. Anybody else want to comment on the psychedelic space?\n\n00:53:55,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'll just make one comment. I had a very interesting conversation last week about all the success that.\n\n00:54:03,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n j j's have with their ketamine molecules so you know they've crossed a billion dollars in sales which is impressive and uh the way it's working is quite interesting they are uh essentially working with pain centers. So they're helping pain centers get into business. Back in the day, pain centers might have been pushing some of the wrong drugs, more opioid type drugs.

And so J &J spent a lot of time sort of training.\n\n00:54:27,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n outpatient pain centers how to use their molecule to really get good results for patients. And the results have really been spectacular. The way the reimbursement works on the J &J drug is also very interesting. It's the services that the centers provide. And the drug itself are all sort of packaged into one payment. And so that provides those centers a way of capturing profitability, which is one of the reasons the drug has done very well. And we all know in our industry incentives for providers matter a great deal in terms of how much the drug actually gets used.\n\n00:55:07,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n And of course, time to efficacy or lack thereof is also very rapid with the ketamine and presumably the next gen catalogs. And that also is a potential system savings because you don't have patients. Uh, empirically going through a number of different oral agents waiting, you know, a couple weeks to see if they get benefit.\n\n00:55:26,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Absolutely.\n\n00:55:28,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n Michael, let's pivot. This is a big week, a big few days ahead here with ASCO, and then you've got the Jefferies healthcare conference as well. Why don't you speak to what's going on over the next week?\n\n00:55:42,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I'm at an airport waiting to go to ASCO. Maybe Josh is too, but obviously ASCO, which I guess in the relative scheme of all of our years doing this combined is a relatively lackluster ASCO, yeah. I guess Summit is also hosting a thing, so we'll see what they're saying on Sunday. Although their data is not at Asheville. Um so there's a lot of uh, a lot of smit cap stuff there. Maris was the big one. I don't know if you guys talked about that. Well, I guess not, because that abstract just hit uh, about uh, their head and neck data, which was a big splash. That stock is now approaching $5 billion market cap on the head and neck indication and other indications as well. So that was a splash at ASCO. We're following the DLL3 space. Obviously, Amgen's Terlatinab is going to have survival data. That's going to be a billion-dollar drug for Amgen and Zylab and also Idea. Are fast following them with some better drugs and Xyle Lab has got some DLL3 data there. So a lot of incremental sneak-tap stuff there, but a relatively lackluster, I guess, Astro from a big picture standpoint.\n\n00:56:44,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, yeah, look, hopefully the tone. Next week at the Jeffries Healthcare Conference will be a stepping stone to the second half of the year. I'm sure all of us are looking for a better second half. We're crossing over summer here. And Marty McCary will be at our conference on Thursday. And let's hope that. He has some positive things to say to the industry and hopefully releases some anxiety. And like I said, they're on a listening tour. And I think, again, from a stock performance perspective, which is what our job is, you know, I think that there's probably only some relief for the second half of the year. So I'm optimistic about that. And hopefully, Marty talks to a bit about his plans and that's not to do with the industry. So let's hope for a good week.\n\n00:57:32,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that's great. And look, you got to give McCary credit for being out there. And he's a good communicator. He's been in multiple forums. And I think the FDA, we do need someone who communicates with transparency and with intention. Scott Gottlieb was really good. We all applauded him as a communicator. So I think it's good to have a leader who can be articulate, who can explain things that we might disagree with. But yeah, I'm encouraged to see what the feedback is from everybody after the listening tour. I'm sure social media will be a buzz.\n\n00:58:04,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, you're right. I mean, this is one of the most regulated industries. Here is the head of the regulatory body. And it's good that we have a transparent. uh i'd say collaborative uh or at least working relationship with the industry and with the regulators right and that they're out there and speaking about how the framework is going to be for the industry and I think that's that's a positive for sure Right?","char_start":53724,"char_end":58189,"start_time":"00:54:27","end_time":null}

Yep. Hey, Nina, last topic. Do you want to touch on this whole Regeneron acquiring 23andMe? I mean, it's been a long, but any perspectives you have on that for our industry?\n\n00:58:39,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I mean, I think Regeneron has been a genetics-based drug discovery target and drug discovery company from inception. So there's a lot of logic to their interest. Um, you know, I think they prevailed in bankruptcy bidding against Anne Wojcicki, founder and CEO of 23andMe. Who continues, I think, to have a passionate conviction in in the ability to build value there and has challenged the sale to Regeneron. So that's a saga to watch play out a little bit. In parallel and this is, you know, the reality for the whole field of of privacy and genetic information, there's a writer in a bill in Congress that's seeking to provide incremental protections to consumers who may have genetic data on deposit with 23andMe to make sure that, in a bankruptcy proceeding, and this would apply obviously not specifically to 23andMe, but to situations like this. That there are protections for the identifiable information.\n\n00:59:43,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n And we could have a much longer conversation about it. Isn't just about anything in sequence potentially identifiable in today's day and age. But at least this is: name, date of birth, address, social information. That would be protected.\n\n01:00:00,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thanks for that. Before we close, any other final comments? From the co-host.\n\n01:00:05,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would just say I'm all for what Regeneron's doing. They've really done a nice job of identifying novel targets from de-identified genetics.\n\n01:00:13,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n phenotypic datasets, and hopefully they'll be able to continue to do that with 23andMe. So bravo for them, and I don't see any particular threat.\n\n01:00:21,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n to patients who are in love with the proposal too.\n\n01:00:25,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right.

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:24,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't know if the biotech hangout crew tweeted this or teased this, but John Crowley was actually supposed to join us today. So we had a lot of like. Policy issues to talk about, but sadly he had a scheduling change and won't be with us today. But there is a lot of to talk about. Sam and Eric, it's always nice when we get M&A. It's been. You know, lacking, at least in a big way, ever since January when we had the big J&J neuro deal.\n\n00:00:59,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n Santa Fe announced that they're going to acquire a blueprint for over $9 billion. That's a pretty good deal. I'll kick it over to you guys to comment.\n\n00:01:08,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n Erik, you go first.\n\n00:01:11,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, sure. Well, um. I mean, big picture, you're right. Brad, it's always great to have M&A in the space. This is, I think, the second largest deal we've seen after [itci] this year. So it's sizable, but the premium wasn't all that big. Uh, coming in at about 27 or so percent.\n\n00:01:31,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n But I guess, from my standpoint, I've been involved with this blueprint medicines for a while. The good fortune of taking them public.\n\n00:01:39,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I think what's great about this acquisition is this is kind of the way that biotech success stories really should play out.\n\n00:01:48,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n This company went public. About 10 years ago, I think the IPO price was $18 per share. At the time, not very many of us had ever even heard of the diseases they were going after. This systemic mastocytosis sounded like Greek to me, and uh, you know, we we came to learn that there were certainly a lot of patients suffering from this disease, both the advanced and indolent forms. And kudos to the team at Blueprint. At the time, it was led by Jeff Albers. Kate Havlund has followed Jeff in his CEO shoes. Of course, Alexis Boris, he's been a longtime chairperson there. They identified that there were these patients in need. They created a solution. I think they really executed to a T. And they built a ton of shareholder value, almost a 10 bagger over 10 years. Um, what if? What a great. Right, I mean this is the way that biotech should play out— you should invest wisely. You should. Treat patients, you should bring better solutions to the world.\n\n00:02:51,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I guess we're going to lose Blueprint, but the world is probably a better place because of this company's existence.\n\n00:02:58,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, that's what I would say here.\n\n00:03:01,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, Eric, the I was listening to our friend Adam Burstein on the podcast that they do on Thursdays and he was lamenting a little bit— or I don't know if you can call it lamenting— that we're going to lose again another company that could have been a more of a success story, therefore not getting to the future Amgen's. But frankly, we seem in the biotech world to want our cake and eat it. We ask for M &A deals.\n\n00:03:31,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n And when the little ones get done, we go, 'Oh, well, that's too little.' It doesn't really count. When big ones get done, we go, oh, see, there could have been an Amgen in the future. I'm not having a go at Adam, God forbid, but you know. It is something that I think is exactly the right thing to happen. Hopefully, fingers crossed, some of that cash gets redeployed back into the sector. I don't know, but I'm assuming that would be the case. I'm hoping that at least some of the specialists will have to do that still. And I think you're right. I've counted 11 deals on our database. M&A deals since the beginning of the year. And then the next larger one was the Lilly's acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics. So that was also a cancer indication.

Although these guys have a cancer indication, but this is not the main driver for this asset.\n\n00:04:24,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, what about from the perspective of Sanofi? Well, it fits rare diseases. It fits in the immunology space that they want to be the world leader in. And that is a stated hope. It gives them a possible, if consensus is right, $2 billion drug by 2030. You know, you're paying $9. 1 billion. That's not ridiculously stretched. And this, I can't imagine, is a is a low margin product in terms of the way you sell it and you find the patients. I don't know, you could probably talk better to that. But it fits well in the general story, but it's not a game changer for Sanofi. But then I suppose M&A deals generally are of this size will not be a game changer for large pharma, right? So.\n\n00:05:11,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n That's actually the thing that stood out to me, Sam. Like, I hate to say this, but Santa Fe has a reputation of like. paying a lot for risky things that many of which have blown up in the past. And I feel like this is a really mature deal for them. And I think. probably a really good thing and I think the timing is right as well just you know All companies, even good ones like this that have a lot of meat on the bones, all valuations have been affected. So, if you can strike for a pretty big deal like this at a time like this, I think it's probably pretty smart.\n\n00:05:49,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, it would be interesting to see if there were lots of other bitters out there because the um, multiple as or the or the premium wasn't like eye-watering right um, on the other hand, 10 billion dollars or 9. 1 billion dollars isn't bad and I quite like the idea of the. This is one time where the CVRs kind of don't matter. It's $129 per share in the $2 CVR for development milestones and $4 CVR for regulatory milestones. I'm assuming most of them are achievable given how low they are. But you almost wonder why they're even there.\n\n00:06:25,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n So.\n\n00:06:27,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Alright, let's move on to the other deal. Um and you know, we could probably talk for an entire hour about all the VEGF PD-1 deals. And of course, Bristol struck and has partnered with Beyond Tech on theirs.\n\n00:06:45,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, we recently had the Pfizer 3S Bio deal, they paid $1. 25 billion upfront and up to $5 billion more. We saw some of 3S Bio's data at ASCO this past week.\n\n00:07:00,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n And also we had the huge summit, Acaso News, that was pretty controversial. I think there was something for both bulls and bears. is in there so maybe I'll start with Eric. I know I read uh a report that you put out uh you know really questioning the sell-off and summit after the ACASO news. Let's maybe start with that, like what was your reaction when you saw that, and of course, like the headline was that The PFS hazard ratio looked fantastic. I think it was like 0. 52, but we still don't have a win on overall survival yet.\n\n00:07:38,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thanks, Brad. Maybe just a step back for the bigger picture here. I guess Selma Dennekeso, their partner, they're kind of the granddaddy of them all in the PD-1 VEGF by specific space. They're in the lead. They're running multiple phase three studies, and this is the drug, Ivanescomab, that really started it all, got people kind of excited about the field.\n\n00:08:00,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n and uh, as many of you know, it's someone at a cast so that about worked on two head-to-head phase three studies against temporalizumab. world's largest pharmaceutical today and beaten Pembroke head to head in lung cancer. That's why. The excitement is here.\n\n00:08:18,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n remaining piece of the puzzle that we had just not seen at all before. was whether the PCASO head-to-head data were going to translate into the United States. All of the Big key studies have been done in China. And I thought this was by far the biggest bear case on the stock and a reasonable one. One.

We got to see them at the ASCO conference. Spent some time with the management team. They're pretty adamant that they've checked this box, that translation, at least in this case, which is not the largest of markets. The case of the Harmony study, we're talking about a second line. subset of lung cancer, those that are EGFR positive. But at least in this Harmony trial, again, management was quite adamant that there's consistency across the geographic subsets, which is what I thought investors really wanted to see. As you noted, the stock sold off, not up, but down. And I think that was because in the second line EGFR positive population, which to me is a fairly small market. The company acknowledged that it may not be able to submit for FDA approval because they've barely missed their overall survival endpoint, P equals 0.\n\n00:10:04,232 [SPEAKER_2]\n 057. Not statistically significant. They've spent all of their alpha at this time point, so the p-value will never be statistically significant, even if the data matures. The P value crosses 0. 05. It'll still be a nominal P value going forward. Um and yeah, I guess you know the street's really really keen to see a survival result. Curious Brad on your views here.\n\n00:10:30,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n I I get that survival is important, but when we talk to people, if you have a hazard ratio for survival that's anywhere in the 0. 8 time 0. 8 range, that it seems like a strong trend. It seems like a drug that's going to be used based on very strong PFS.\n\n00:10:49,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n and borderline OS, but please tell me what I'm missing.\n\n00:10:53,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well.\n\n00:10:55,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n you know, What we're missing is there's still no real like conclusive hypothesis of why this combo in a bispecific should work. You know, Roche studied VEGF and PD-1.\n\n00:11:09,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n But, you know, it's two separate things in combo and never really succeeded. And there's always that hypothesis out there that VEGF can kind of accelerate mets initially or shrink tumors initially, but accelerate mets over the long term.\n\n00:11:29,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n Without a clear hypothesis of why one is better than two things together and nobody actually hitting on OS yet, I think it's still a legitimate risk. I'm in the camp that this is all going to succeed in the end. But I do think that we're not there yet. So I do think it's a legitimate, like, there's a legitimate risk that's still on the table.\n\n00:11:59,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, so okay.\n\n00:12:01,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n I watched. I was going into this thinking the e-value of this trial is not the potential to get approval and get some sales, because there's an incumbent out there called Johnson and Johnson, with a different regime for post-EGFR patients, as approved.\n\n00:12:17,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n And in fact, it is approved without an overall survival signal. Even on the second entry read, they haven't hit it yet. But it's approved. There are other drugs coming. Astra is working on a TROP2. And there are other ways that people are trying to treat this particular patient group. So I thought commercially, why would I, even if it doesn't get approved, all I was looking for was this cross read from China to, as Eric said, to the West, if you like, US.","char_start":8029,"char_end":11968,"start_time":"00:08:51","end_time":null}

And the issue I also heard a few people say, and this is, you know, I don't know, you want to call it misinformation, you want to call it just want to be a bear, was folks said, no, but even that patient group was so immature that couldn't have possibly made a difference to the, to the, to the, to the HR hazard ratio. And you look at it, hang on, how's that possible? Last patient treated was in recruitment closed in August. And it had been open for two years or roughly two years or a year at least a year and a half or so. So it's very possible that, at least on the progression-free survival hazard ratio, there's a lot of the U. S. patients already counted.\n\n00:13:30,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n You haven't had enough events in that latter group and that perhaps it doesn't work out in the end for OS. But I just, I was standing listening to some. someone telling me this, and I was like, these people are just looking for excuses, which is natural. It was the same as people did when it was the early days of coffee tea, if you remember. They were just trying to find reasons why it wouldn't work. And I'm not just here trying to parallel it to yet another Chinese asset. And the issue then also ends up being that you just have to now wait till you see the actual detail. You know, it was 0. 52, Eric. versus the 0. 47 or 0. 46, depending on which data point you want to look at back in China. So you can start doing some magic maths, which I hate doing because it's pretty much always wrong to see what the hazard ratio was in the US population. And let's say it's 0. 62. Why is that bad? Right? So I'm also, I was a bit agog at the share price reaction.\n\n00:14:35,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Do you guys have any thoughts on Bristol partnering with the BeyondTech asset specifically?\n\n00:14:41,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, sure. I'll kick that in. And then Eric, I'm pretty sure he has some meaningful thoughts on it too. One of the things that I always worried about the biontic acid, and there's another company who's got a PD-L1 VEGF, and that's that's InstaBIOS. So on the one hand, if you took a vote around the conference, anyone you bumped into saying, 'Is PD-L1 better than PD-L1?' They go, 'Yes.' because of the history of what we know, right? D-truidobdivo versus drubalumab and tizolizumab. Then you ask them, do you think a PD-L1 VEGF would be better? A PD1 budget, then they start getting all hypothetical, hypothetically PD-L1. Should really be the thing that you use to target things to a tumor, which is because it's expressed on the tumor. But it always made me worried that in the background, people are going to eventually find that this ends up going down the road of other PD-L1s. So the deal. Kind of takes some of that risk away.\n\n00:15:42,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't think it clarifies the situation, but it takes some of that risk away. And now you have the opportunity, partnered with Bristol, taking some of that cash, $3. 5 billion, pretty much guaranteed to 2028, to possibly do a combo with a PD-1. I know initially you think, what, Sam? But if you think about it, if you're using the PD-L1 as a targeting molecule, and you've got the PD-1 to do its job on the T cell, yeah, there is some kind of logic, but hell, I'm not going to be designing those trials. But that's what I thought about, and I think it's really it.\n\n00:16:19,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think Sam's touching on something that's really important in this debate. There's just so much that we don't yet know about these drugs, these bispecifics. You know, we know that they're interesting, active. I think we know that they're differentiated. And Brad, I'll take you up on your. Prior point that, you know, this this could be a VEGF plus.","char_start":11668,"char_end":15706,"start_time":"00:12:48","end_time":null}

Prior point that, you know, this this could be a VEGF plus.\n\n00:16:42,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n PD-1 monovalent. Antibody combination. It's possible, but I think we are seeing some differentiated properties here too. We're not seeing the side effects that you'd expect from systemic VEGF. seeing activity in squamous tumors that you wouldn't expect from VEGF. On a safety profile basis, we're seeing head-to-head versus Pembro was mad activity that we wouldn't expect. We're seeing activity in second line. EGFR-positive patients where you wouldn't expect PD-1s to have impact. There's a lot going on here, right? And that's why there is all this interest, whether it's from Merck or Bristol or Pfizer or others. Um, and I just think that we're going to need to be a little bit patient. We'll probably need to buckle up because certainly the world has shown us that summit is going to be extraordinarily volatile. As a security, as we turn over some of these cards.\n\n00:17:32,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, over time data will win.\n\n00:17:35,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, did you guys have a chance to see the 3S bio poster? I didn't, but it looked like from Twitter that everything was pretty positive and it looked genuinely impressive.\n\n00:17:51,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n I did. So we wrote on it, Brad. So the first thing, as an analyst, that you look at when you see data updates is to compare it to the last data update. So we've got a little table that follows it from the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference 2025.\n\n00:18:08,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n The ASCO abstract. So they went from 24 patients to 25 patients in the ASCO abstract. And then the data at ASCO itself, they went up to 34 patients. So the overall response rate did soften a bit from about the 70% range to 67 and a half percent range. I mean, is that even fair to call it? A little bit there as you add more patients.\n\n00:18:31,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n The cutoff is March, so there's room for some of those responses, maybe some of the stable patients might become a responder. Disease control rate remained at the top end, so nearly 100%.\n\n00:18:49,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n And when you look at these, what I liked about the spider plot, one of the things that people always say about VEGF is that it's a first scan effect so that you're getting that vasculature impact potentially on that first scan and you know when you look at the summit AKISO PFS curve it does give you that little hint, possibly you get a big drop on the first scan and then it's a parallel line on the Kaplan-Meier curve of the. But when you look at this data and other data from other presentations in this area in general, you see that the patients in the spider plot, the responses keep getting deeper. So this is not just in the same patient, right? It's not just the first scan effect. I'm pretty sure somebody much more knowledgeable than me can explain that in a different way and say, you know, Sam, it's still a first scan. In fact, you're wrong. I don't think so. But I, and you know, it just looks pretty good.\n\n00:19:52,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n It looks like it could be one of the best out there. And you look at it in terms of the.\n\n00:19:58,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n AEs, one thing I do worry about is I always look at proteinuria and hypertension in these trials because that is the VEGF signal, right?\n\n00:20:06,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n And it's not low, 17% grade three, no proteinuria, but 17% grade three. I mean, this compares to a much larger data set for even SMA of 5% grade three. So these molecules are different. They're not all doing the same thing. And of course, when you start looking at the BioNTech one, you see even higher numbers, but it's often combined with chemo. We haven't seen many single agent by Airbnb 327. data set so that gets a bit complicated to try and understand, but frankly it looked pretty decent.\n\n00:20:36,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right. Well, we'll get back to ASCO in a second, but let's. Talk about some other really interesting data that that came out that's non-oncology this week, and um, the first one eric is Eric is Vera, so that's the IGaN space, and we just had some news uh from a competitor company about that today at ular as well right.","char_start":15406,"char_end":19821,"start_time":"00:16:42","end_time":null}

I can imagine their heads spinning.\n\n00:21:08,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n You're right, Brad. They came out on Monday of this week with what we thought are some really fantastic data in the IGaN space, the IgA nephropathy space. For those less familiar with what's going on here, you know, again, it's been sort of an untreatable disease for decades. Standard of care is essentially symptomatic management or non-disease modifying therapies that allow the kidney to function a little bit better. But don't reverse or retard or slow the downward progression. And all of the therapies we're about to talk about and others are operating on B cells, which it appears are fundamentally causative agents in this disease.\n\n00:21:51,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n The folks at Vera have a drug called Atacicept and it's a BathApril. inhibitor. And the phase three data that they put forth earlier in the week showed wonderfully strong reductions in protein area, placebo-adjusted, at the low 40s. We already know from previous data sets, the test also does. slow, if not completely.\n\n00:22:14,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n retard the degradation of kidney function in patients so they've got a very comprehensive data set. And with this phase three result that came out on on Monday, they intend to file for approval.\n\n00:22:28,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Toward the end of the year. Meanwhile, competitor just on the tape today, has their drug, Sopranolab. This is a. an April only inhibitor, so very related in its mechanism, we're not quite sure whether there's benefit to inhibition of both BAF-APRIL in addition to APRIL, but at least in preclinical models, the dual inhibitor does look a little bit better. Nonetheless, Otsuka has some, again, very solid data of its own. If anything, they're showing protein area data that's a little bit. Better in terms of absolute magnitude of reduction than Atacisept from Farah, I don't think you can make a comparative efficacy claim on that. I will take issue with our. our friend at Stat News who published that the Otsuka data were better. I don't see that in the database. I think there are some baseline variables that confound any such analysis. And honestly, what kidney patients care about and what doctors care about isn't whether you have lower protein in the urine.\n\n00:23:33,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's whether over time your disease is more stable in terms of downward progression of kidney function. And again, that's data that that Vera has, and so far, at least, that Suka doesn't. Bottom line, these are both going to be, I think, very quickly embraced and widely embraced therapies for IGAM patients. We think this is a huge market. We think it's probably a 15 or billion-dollar-plus kind of an opportunity.\n\n00:24:01,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, you know, I feel for the folks at Vera who had some wonderful data and now are maybe playing defense.\n\n00:24:09,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n An area where again, you know, we've talked about this before on this show— there is no usual one winner, take-all phenomenon biotech. We're probably going to talk about this when we talk about Baikara and Mara in a few minutes. This Igan space certainly big enough for two players.\n\n00:24:26,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think both companies are going to make a lot of money here.\n\n00:24:29,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Brad, Sam, I don't know if you guys have additional thoughts.\n\n00:24:33,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I would just say, like, I always want to be careful about like talking about M &A, but, um, But that's kind of the Vera story is, as you pointed out, this is a huge market. And when I see data like this, that is.\n\n00:24:47,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n trying to compare two different companies. Well, I think about like potentially commercially one day, what would this drug look like in the hands of a much bigger pharmaceutical company? especially given what a huge market that is.","char_start":19521,"char_end":23745,"start_time":"00:21:01","end_time":null}

I don't know what will happen with them, of course, but I would say to be as competitive as they are in this space. puts them in a really good position. As you know, there's been a lot of deals in the nephrology space over the last couple of years. It's definitely an area of increased focus for the larger companies.\n\n00:25:28,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, Brad. I just wanted to add something not specifically on this, but I know how I feel.\n\n00:25:34,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n I can almost sense you two being, I'm not going to say that is the case, but. We're all exhausted from ASCO. But actually, we've had a pretty exciting week. And I think that maybe our, I don't know if others are hearing us. As enthusiastic and enthused. But I just want to make sure that folks listening are not thinking that because we've got a week that started with two deals, essentially, right?\n\n00:26:01,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, one much bigger than the other, we've had a ton of good data. Some share price moves in the wrong direction, but some in the right. You know, and the XBI for however much we love it or hate it is meaningfully up. Um, in the week and also since it's low, I just want to make sure that I. I suspect that we're going to to go and talk about all the magic of stuff that we've seen at ASCO. But I want to make sure people don't walk away thinking, 'Oh, God, this is not a very, you know, these guys are old.' Down in the mouth.\n\n00:26:34,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, yeah, and in fact, I'll take that hand off real quick and transition to our next piece of data that I thought was super exciting.\n\n00:26:43,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I would say, like, um.\n\n00:26:45,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, one thing that biotech always needs is like a new technology to get really excited about.\n\n00:26:52,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think the PD-1 by VEGF and just like the whole bispecific space is turning into that.\n\n00:26:59,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n One new technology that I'm really excited about, if you think about it, like really in the first inning, is protein degradation.\n\n00:27:09,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n So our Venus, you know, weeks ago had the first ever phase three trial of like uh readout of a protac. And the market viewed it as disappointing because it was a breast cancer trial and they degraded estrogen receptor, and it only worked in a subset of patients. But it was a successful phase three trial for you know, 40% of this particular breast cancer group. And then I think really exciting, Chimera had an announcement on Monday. And this is just healthy volunteer data, but they're big believers in the STAT-6 target.\n\n00:27:50,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n The whole idea here. And really the whole idea of this class is to, you know, have like a new modality that you can especially make, you know, potentially simple oral therapy. So the idea here is like. a once daily world. Competitor to do Pixent. And so, they had data. Again, healthy volunteer data, so we have to see how it translates into people with actual inflammatory diseases.\n\n00:28:18,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n But from doses at 1. 5 megs and up, and they went to like 200 megs, like some like huge number, but like from 1. 5 and up, they had 90% degradation.\n\n00:28:32,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n They had a real clean safety profile.\n\n00:28:35,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n And even in biomarkers that you look for, about like, potentially treating diseases, which is pretty tricky in healthy volunteers, because by definition, and they don't have the disease, but the T2 T2 biomarkers they saw really nice reductions in TARC and exotaxin 3 and like other biomarkers that would suggest that this might work in actual patients. So they've already moved to the phase 1B portion of this. So we'll see actual atopic derm patient data sometime like in the fourth quarter, towards the end of the year.\n\n00:29:15,150 [SPEAKER_0]\n Now they're moving it into to other things like um asthma. So I think it's uh, I think that protein degradation, I'm a big believer in it. I think that that's going to be a technology that could add some real excitement to the biotech sector over the coming years.

It's very early.\n\n00:29:38,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n Any technology there's going to be ups and downs, and I guess you could argue that we saw that with the Arvenis data, but um, in terms of like something new, like around the corner, I think it's something to be excited about.\n\n00:29:54,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, look, Brad, I think you're absolutely right, because it gives you a whole new – set of targets to work with that may not be amenable to standard enzyme inhibition, if you like, right? And it just opens such a big window of opportunity, assuming you get the molecule design right.\n\n00:30:17,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n And the pharmacology right. So it is absolutely, I think it's going to be a cornerstone of future drug development.\n\n00:30:28,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n For sure. And ironically, on the exact same day, Nurex struck a stat 6 deal with Santa Fe, and actually Nurix will have BTK data. itty-ha next week and we already saw.\n\n00:30:44,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n um We already saw Beijing have BTK data at the last dash, so I think it's something to watch closely.\n\n00:30:55,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Let's go back to ASCO. And Eric, I'm going to start with you. What were your overall impressions? Was this like an up year, a down year? kind of like middle of the road.\n\n00:31:10,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I'll come back to Sam's comments. I hope that our tiredness— i mean I'm just exhausted— it seems like uh you know this week won't ever end, but But I hope that our listeners are not. Interpreting that as anything but a wonderful week for uh for biotech and a wonderful week for oncology, I think. In terms of ASCO, maybe you know, you could say it was a down year in terms of there not being any major headlines, big game-changing clinical trial results that we were previously not aware of. Certainly, there were some game-changing results. I'm sure Sam might want to talk about Trevely, etc.\n\n00:31:51,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n But what I thought was the real theme here was just how much innovation was ongoing, maybe a lot of that in small cap biotech, maybe a lot of that in earlier stage data sets. But. You know this. This innovation kind of creeps up on you. I think both of you were old enough to know that. When we used to talk about pancreatic cancer or melanoma or some of these really, really difficult to treat tumors, we used to say, 'Wow, this company's got a 7% response rate, a 12% response rate. That's the best we've ever seen. That's an active drug.' And now in some of these tumor types like pancreatic or melanoma, we're kind of sticking our nose up at response rates in the 20s, 30s, even 40% on occasion. So things have changed. And even at this gas school in particular.\n\n00:32:42,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll point out some newer targets in pancreatic and melanoma that I think are going to continue to be game changers. Everyone knows in pancreatic cancer, the KRAS inhibitors, Revolution Medicine is kind of leading the charge there. But a new target, I think, is emerging that we're increasingly excited about. It's PRM T5.\n\n00:33:02,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n pioneered by Bristol Amgen to a certain extent, maybe Tango could be. One of the emerging leaders in this space as well. The data from Bristol at ASCO were showing about a 25% response rate in pancreatic cancer, which again, is a tumor type that's never really seen. Any meaningful success other than the KRAS inhibitors. That's highly, highly encouraging. And I think we'd love to see that combined with a KRAS inhibitor, a PRMT5 plus KRAS, and just see how far this presumably fairly well tolerated targeted combination can go. And then, on the melanoma side, one thing that struck me was the Amatix data. This is a European company that's pioneering a frame-directed CR cell therapy. Brad, I know you love the cell therapy space and, sure, you were very very happy to see that they've got response rates in refractory melanoma. Again, an indication where we're used to saying something in the 20% range might be interesting.\n\n00:34:07,150 [SPEAKER_2]\n They've got a 55% response rate in those patients.

All of the Kols were really raving about this candidate, at least those that we spoke to. Great to see that innovation can sneak up on you, and sometimes, you know, um. Being away from ASCO, you kind of come back after a few years and say, 'Wow, this is why we do this job.'\n\n00:34:40,179 [SPEAKER_0]\n And Sam? I think if you had to declare a winner of ASCO, probably most people— us bats would have been on Astra, and Inheritu, with their partner Daishi Senkyo, had an another important year.\n\n00:34:53,489 [SPEAKER_1]\n um and breast cancer tell us about astra's esco yeah i mean look brad um it's i i hear people go this is not a very exciting esco to go to and then we all come back with all these new molecules pmc5 that that eric just spoke to the evolving data for the KRAS, which I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit. And then here you get trials that are going into tumors that have not necessarily had the best of luck so far, pancreatic being one of them. So I'll start off by saying. this felt another. um astra uh asco or at least one of the key players with astra you know seven years in a row that they get a plenary and they're very happy to keep highlighting that No standing ovation, though. I was sitting next to a a friend of ours who's on the y side and they were looking for a standing ovation and they didn't get it this time, but lots of clapping. So what did we get? We got in Finzi in the Matterhorn Study in gastric cancer, really unprecedented event-free survival benefits.\n\n00:35:56,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n So that was really um, I think, pretty much ready to to give you that practice-changing setup. And then you went in HER2 for first-line HER2 positive setting in the Destiny Bristol 9 trial. That also seemed to suggest that it's opening up another significant patient population or opportunity. Of course, as Eric's highlighted trudelby in in the Acento 4 trial, first line PD-L1 positive, triple negative breast cancer combined with Keytruda, really pretty impressive PFS hazard ratio of 0.65. So, you know, and then you add that to the Ascento3 data that we had in PDA1 negative patients, there's lots really do suggest a meaningful opportunity here for Gilead-Trudelvi in that space. So, breast cancer. When I want to talk to folks outside saying, 'Look, cancer is a cure, everyone says, 'Is there a cure?'\n\n00:37:02,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm just saying there are now people with myeloma or breast cancer who live long enough to die of something else. That. If you can't pull that cure, I don't know what you're looking for, right? And I'm just hoping, melanoma is the term, right? I'm just hoping that the same will start happening with some of these other tumors. And the early data that we see at ASCO is what gives us hope that we're going to get there.\n\n00:37:28,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I would echo— I think Gilead had a really good ASCO. I mean, this is their biggest ASCO in years and years.\n\n00:37:35,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, Trodelvi is really starting to bloom. I mean, these breast cancer indications that they're succeeding in now.\n\n00:37:43,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n Are a really big deal and you know, let's not forget that cell therapy is cooking too. Um, like kite now is like two billion dollar a year revenue for them, which is really amazing. A lot of critics, you know, would have never predicted that. And I'd also say that I don't feel like we talked a lot about cell therapy at this year's ASCO, but they had some interesting brain cancer data that I thought was kind of fascinating.\n\n00:38:12,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n But getting back to Trodelvi, one thing that really stood out to me as I was thinking about that is: Look at all of the investments that, you know, they bought that asset for over $20 billion.\n\n00:38:27,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, look at the the roller coaster that has been. And one thing that I kind of thought of, just kind of thinking of like the long road of how they've taken it from where it was to like where it is now, like really accelerating.\n\n00:38:40,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't think a smaller company could have done that.","char_start":31716,"char_end":36195,"start_time":"00:34:07","end_time":null}

I think it really makes an argument. Of you know, the value of like scale and big companies for certain assets. And so I think they deserve a lot of credit for always being like full speed ahead on Trodelvy when.\n\n00:39:08,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n A lot of critics, maybe us included, at times were really critical of that deal and their development program.\n\n00:39:18,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, Sam speaking of Astra, um, one of the companies that I interviewed for Biotech TV was um, Arkis, and they had their Hip2 Alpha data at ASCO, but um, I know one thing that we were talking about kind of on the sidelines is the whole Tidget field and all of the disappointments that we've seen there lately. Roche, of course, had the big skyscraper mess. A lot of companies have divested of their programs.\n\n00:39:52,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Beijing did recently. We just had ITOs literally close shop.\n\n00:39:58,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n About a week ago, and Interestingly, there's two companies that are full speed ahead on Tidget. So one of them is Astra. They're specifically doing bispecifics, and then the other one is Arcus. I think it's setting up to be like, potentially a fascinating story because there's something that those two things have in common, which is that both of those programs are FC silent. I know both companies strongly believe that that's a huge, huge factor that makes them day and night different. What's your take on that? I think Astra now has like 10 key studies going full steam ahead, right?\n\n00:40:43,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yep, yep. I mean, look, Brad, I'm a simple person.\n\n00:40:47,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n When I think about having an FC active on a molecule that binds to a T cell, it just worries me a little bit. Right, you think. Well, why would I want anti-antibody directed cytotoxicity against the T cell? That's the only argument I find. Having the FC and maybe you can also manage the side effects a bit better if you didn't have the FC active. Um, but in terms of Astra, I mean they're they're really putting their money where their mouth is. They've got 10 trials. What have I got here? One, two, three, four, five in non-small cell lung cancer. Two in Billy Retract. One in HCC hepatocellular, one in endometrial, and one gastric. And what's interesting here, so this adds up to about 8,000 patients, all phase III, right? 10 trials. So they have seen a signal, and Susan Goldbraith talks about this signal that they had a poster on at CITSE, which unfortunately is one conference I didn't go to this year.\n\n00:41:50,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n and the one that probably had that one little interesting nugget at it.\n\n00:41:54,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that they're seeing an interferon gamma signature response in some of the patients. I don't know the full story. I need to see the poster. The reality is that they presented two sets of data. And just by the way, out of these 10, only one of them is monotherapy and this is not monotherapy— right this is my specific— this is pd1 teaching. So the rest are data, which is the top two. So it brings you back to the thinking about, well, how could that play out for a Gilead? Had given that they've got the access to the Arcus drug as far as I remember, that they must have given up right. I don't know if they've given up. You'd remind me. I'm getting a blank here. They have not given up. There you go. Yeah. Thank you. So you can imagine a combo of Tredelvi plus Tidget, if one of these trials creeps out. And they have TDXD and HER2 in combo. They've got chemo, they've got bevacizumab plus tremolumab. In fact, that's their answer. Every time somebody asked them, 'why did you get a PD-1 VEGF?'","char_start":35895,"char_end":40032,"start_time":"00:38:40","end_time":null}

Every time somebody asked them, 'why did you get a PD-1 VEGF?'\n\n00:42:57,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n They go, 'well, we're actually doing a tremolumab, you know, bevacizumab plus a hepatocellular carcinoma setting.' So the data they presented was. And this drug is called rilvogostomic, right? I have to say it looked pretty decent when I'm looking at the lung cancer data that they showed, I think, tropion lung O4, we had 71% ORR in the PD-L1 high patients, 40% in the negative patients right and then all the cuts surpassed monotherapy uh results that we saw surpassed river gossiping monotherapy results that we saw of course you have to watch out for adverse events right as soon as you put trop2 in there a whole bunch of new adverse events come along stomachitis being the one that really upsets people 53 was the was the rate in the trial so how this pans out into the uh phase three so i don't know and then they have the um the biliary tract cancer trial, the Gemini data, Which was a combo with uh versus infinity, it's uh with infinity and they showed a um a higher objective response rate here (31) only slightly versus the i think it was the topaz trial if i remember correctly um and so again\n\n00:44:17,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n another positive signal on pretty much every line uh and then of course now it's the btc's in two trials in phase three so the signals are there astra's going for it and we're going to see the real outcome of all this in um in uh from 2026 or 2027 i think as the date as the trials read out Maybe this is how AC is going to win, ASCO 2026, 2027, 2028, and beyond.\n\n00:44:47,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n Who knows?\n\n00:44:47,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think 2026 will probably be a vanza.\n\n00:44:51,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n Right, which is a drop toothless.\n\n00:44:53,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes. Brad, love your thoughts on the Arcus HIP Alpha that you mentioned. It looked pretty good to me. Do you think it's differentiated?\n\n00:45:02,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, well, I think it's. It's almost like the IGAN discussion we just had. I think it's potentially such a huge market that, if they're second and even just comparable, I think it's a huge market and a huge opportunity.\n\n00:45:17,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, for them and I do think that, uh, it like their data looks slightly better than Mercs right now, and People really like this asset because, of course, you have a validated target that's on the market right now. And I would say, if we were talking two years ago, everyone would have said that Tidget was Arcus's main program. And given all the volatility that's had— you know, given how Marcus succeeded with HIF-2 Alpha.\n\n00:45:45,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think for sure that the HIF-2 Alpha is now Arcus' main program, and I think it's super interesting.\n\n00:45:52,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm going to move on to— Brad, can I just correct myself very quickly here, just for perfection's sake? The Gemini trial is rivagostivic plus chemotherapy in HER2-negative BTC.\n\n00:46:09,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n Right. I'm going to move on. Eric alluded to it earlier, but something that was like a really interesting bull-bear debate at ASCO. And, you know, I always preface this by saying we're rooting for everyone's success, like obviously in our industry, everyone.\n\n00:46:24,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n The companies themselves are, you know, we want patients to succeed. But, you know, the reality of our business is that we do have competition.\n\n00:46:34,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think the big competition at this year's ASCO was Maris versus Baikara. So this is head and neck cancer, which traditionally is a very difficult cancer to treat, and the checkpoint inhibitors by themselves have very low response rates and so we definitely need something new. And these two programs are slightly different.\n\n00:46:59,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bicara is a fusion protein that's EGFR.\n\n00:47:04,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n By TGF-beta, and Maris is more of a traditional bispecific antibody that's EGFR by LGR. Five so Eric, I'll pass it over to you. I don't know if you cover both of these companies or just one, but I'm interested to know, like, what your thought is on this, like potential competition.","char_start":39732,"char_end":44103,"start_time":"00:42:57","end_time":null}

I don't know if you cover both of these companies or just one, but I'm interested to know, like, what your thought is on this, like potential competition.\n\n00:47:26,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and I think, thanks, Brad, we covered just by Cara, and I think the theme of our discussion today is this: I don't know, fight to the death, competitive match between drugs in the same class. You know, Wall Street, we always like to pick a winner. We always. Like to think we're capable of picking a winner and we always like to think that it's a winner-take-all battle that's rarely how these markets play out. We can go back to or discussion of IGAN or. Discussion uh, we just had on hip alpha now we're heading into a similar discussion on frontline head and neck cancer marketplace, which is a big market, probably a three or four billion market.\n\n00:48:07,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's a real disconnect here between what the doctors are saying and what investors are saying.\n\n00:48:13,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n Physicians are much more even-handed in their views toward these two molecules. They're saying that both are pretty much off the charts, better than anything we've seen before. We've got response rates in the 50%, 60% for both of these molecules on top of Keytruda and the frontline at neck cancer setting. That's about three times the response rate you would expect from Keytruda alone.\n\n00:48:36,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n This is coming back to our other theme of the day, major, major innovation. In the cancer space. Both companies are now in phase three. Maris is a little bit ahead.\n\n00:48:47,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Marist certainly has some potential competitive differentiation that might become an advantage for it. Um, on the other hand, you know, the street has accorded Maris essentially, you know, winner take all status in this battle. Maris has a market valuation of around. four plus billion dollars.\n\n00:49:06,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Baikara, much like Arcus, I think Brad Marcus is trading a little bit below its cash balance. Baikara is trading a little bit above its cash balance. Generally, these two companies getting very little credit for having competitive entrance in the space.\n\n00:49:20,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n And we think the Bicara molecule, Fiserafus, which as you called out, it's not just— EGFR, but TGF beta— we think it is looking differentiated itself in ways that might be positive from a competitive standpoint. The depth of response and durational response here look very good to me.\n\n00:49:39,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sure, you can certainly buy the class, and the class is probably undervalued in some of these competitive battles.\n\n00:49:46,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, markets have a way of kind of evening out over time, and we're hopeful that my car will get its due.\n\n00:49:53,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n What are your thoughts?\n\n00:49:56,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I think. Eric—um, you know one of the things that are that people are questioning about Bicara is the Marist one seems to be working in both HPV negative and HPV positive.\n\n00:50:10,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I know HPV positive is a much smaller like indication, but um, but people are just kind of maybe using that as like a benchmark for comparing the two, like if one is working in both patient populations, and one company seems to like have pretty much abandoned.\n\n00:50:31,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, that HPV positive group, maybe that says something about the strength of their assets. What do you think about that argument?\n\n00:50:39,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's a great, great point to make. Thank you for bringing it up. Interestingly, we talk about head and neck cancer as head and neck cancer, but physician experts these days increasingly think about it as you just parsed out, HPV positive and negative disease. And almost few of these two disease states is very different as if they're different histologies, different tumor types altogether.","char_start":43803,"char_end":47854,"start_time":"00:47:26","end_time":null}

And almost few of these two disease states is very different as if they're different histologies, different tumor types altogether.\n\n00:51:02,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n And you're right, it is true that Bakar has selected the HPV negative subset. It actually has very good biologic rationale for pursuing HPV negative patients. That's based on preclinical data and now increasingly translational data in the clinic. To support the use of not only the EGFR, aspect of the molecule, but also the TGF beta aspect, into why. Uh, molecularly mechanistically this makes sense to go after HPV-negative tumors. So I'm a big believer that they've actually turned what could be a negative into a positive by selecting out. The patients that are most appropriate for their therapy. This may be where we do see some differences. The Meris molecule doesn't work through TGF-beta. It may be active in HPV-positive patients. But it also may not be as active in HPV positive patients. So again, we've got something to learn here and probably not going to be a one-size-fits-all market.\n\n00:52:02,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n I just want to mention: I did 15 interviews throughout the four days of ASCO for Biotech TV, and the one I did with the CEO of Baikara, Claire Mazumdar, was actually my favorite.\n\n00:52:18,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I've always been a big believer that the best CEOs, just like the best leaders in our industry, period.\n\n00:52:27,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n Everyone wants to do media when things like [are] terrific and going great. And not to say that she had a bad ASCO or even that the competitive, as you're hearing now, there's an argument to be made, a strong argument to be made for this, but it was controversial.\n\n00:52:48,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Especially doing video, you know, is like a whole different, you know, it's like a whole different thing too. And, you know, people get nervous, like, you know, about maybe like saying the wrong thing on video or whatever.\n\n00:53:00,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n She came and really stood up for herself and her company and for her data. And we had a good, you know. a good, I think, balanced discussion about it. And I brought up a lot of the bear arguments and everything.\n\n00:53:16,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'll let viewers decide on.\n\n00:53:19,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, like the substance of the answers and everything, but I thought she did just a terrific job of being out there and being visible at a time when, like, her stock price, you know, wasn't so great after they put out the abstracts and analysts, you know, some analysts were kind of, you know, really being hard on this comparison and everything. So I just want to give her credit and just kind of point out that, that's what really like true leaders do. So credit to her for doing that. And I thought it was a great discussion.\n\n00:53:53,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um. We only have a couple minutes left.\n\n00:53:57,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, It's probably good. Sadly, it would have been great to have him on. But as I mentioned at the start, we almost had John Crowley on today. And given everything that we've talked about, I don't know how we would have fit in, like all of the policy stuff that's been going on. But I think maybe we'll just like briefly touch on one. So there was a big cell and gene therapy meeting.\n\n00:54:20,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of course, everyone is wondering, with Vinay Prasad, like some of the previous things that he said about some gene therapies like Srepta and things like that, like what the FDA's stance is going to be on some of those types of emerging technologies. Did either of you guys see any of like that meeting or any of the comments out of it? And do you have any thoughts?\n\n00:54:52,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I guess I'll start. I mean, I actually had the benefit of speaking with John this week. We did host Mr. Crowley on a Cantor webinar.","char_start":47554,"char_end":51563,"start_time":"00:51:02","end_time":null}

We did host Mr. Crowley on a Cantor webinar.\n\n00:55:02,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n I know he was at the meeting. And for those of us who are listening in, I think we all came to the same conclusion, which is right now we're hearing. Uh, great things from the FDA. I want to emphasize hearing because you know, talk is cheap. We still need to see the follow through, and there are still, in my opinion, some concerns about staff and resourcing that need to be addressed. But wow, I don't think the FDA could have had a better week either, right? They came out not just at that meeting, Brad, but the day before, Dr. Macri made some comments that were well received. I know he was also at a conference on Wall Street saying, pretty much exactly what investors wanted to hear, which is he's pro innovation.\n\n00:55:47,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n He's pro and efficient.\n\n00:55:49,779 [SPEAKER_2]\n registrational and regulatory body. and uh and we're not going to be you know maybe going back into the dark ages as far as wiring back some of the progress that we made under the prior administrations.\n\n00:56:07,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n I saw a comment in the news, too. I think it might have actually been his own tweet. I saw RFK commented on the the bass editing, the UPenn baby that happily went home this week as well. So I thought that was like A good.\n\n00:56:27,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, like you said, words, but a good boat of confidence in just like the whole gene editing field. So maybe that's a positive.\n\n00:56:38,150 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, of course, I'm sure everyone's seen this.\n\n00:56:41,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n The FDA also had their first— they're trying to meet with the CEOs of— companies in the industry. They had their first one in the DC area. I know they're headed to the Bay Area and San Diego.\n\n00:56:57,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Around bio time they're going to have one here in Boston as well. So I'm sure that, um, some details of those meetings will start trickling out as they start happening. So maybe we'll get a little more clarity on just kind of their relationship with the industry and, like, our industry's ability to give them feedback on you know what's really affecting us and what's important to us.\n\n00:57:23,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n And now, to end today's session. Down though, because it it has been so wildly positive in so many different ways this week. Sam, you're right to call that out earlier in the call. But Um, You know, John did mention that we're still not in a good place with MFN. We may be in a better place with the FDA. I think we're all feeling pretty good about that.\n\n00:57:45,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Where bio really does need our support and where I hope all of our listeners will stand up. And join hands and fight for the industry that we all love and believe in. is on the drug pricing side, where you know, unfortunately, things have not progressed as favorably maybe as some. As the regulatory bodies or other topics that we're talking about this week.\n\n00:58:07,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n I guess Eric and Brad, I think we're also all holding our breaths, hopefully not for much longer.\n\n00:58:14,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n On the tariff front, right? I don't know how much longer that would take. I don't know how much time a 232 investigation.\n\n00:58:23,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n As it might, it might take several months, from what I understand, so you've got that still hanging over our heads. But the MFN is the bigger one, and how it gets implemented.\n\n00:58:33,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Let's just remember that we've just had a week of great cancer data, and some pancreatic cancer patients, hopefully, in a few years, will be sitting in a world where the um— you're looking at second-line and third-line therapies, which are active, that would be great.","char_start":51263,"char_end":55253,"start_time":"00:54:52","end_time":null}

All right, let's start with who's optimistic from here?\n\n00:01:26,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n I am.\n\n00:01:28,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n I thank you.\n\n00:01:30,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I feel like so far, right? I mean, I assume everybody here saw that Bloomberg article and it's probably covered elsewhere.\n\n00:01:38,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Actually, it was covered widely, right? Because a reporter asked Trump around. The trader phrase, 'taco,' right? Trump always chickens out. That being the joke, that as a trader, you should be buying dips on tariffs and any macro news because things sort of alleviate. I mean. At least in my conversations with investors, I think there's some. There's a growing school of thought that therapeutics has played out the same way, right? I mean, you probably should have bought the dip when RFK was first appointed. That's a stock comment, not a not a political world public health comment, but that that's potentially the reality. Right. I mean, same when Peter Marx was uh dismissed from the FDA, same on the tariff day like I so I think We're going to talk about MFN. I think my only point of caution is a few of the CEOs I've talked to in my coverage universe who are very involved in pharma. They are— they're more worried than the average investor. I mean, I think they're— they're coming from the place that like farmers not going to get out totally unscathed. Right. Like some concession has to be made. But. I mean, it feels like things are improving, right? I mean, it feels like the FDA is really open for business.\n\n00:02:40,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n We've seen. companies without a buyer successfully launch drugs really, really well. We've seen some small companies be able to like micros be able to recapitalize themselves. We've seen M&A with premiums that are more modest, which I interpret as a good sign that maybe we're actually seeing mid-cap companies as more willing, realistic sellers. I feel like there's a lot. to like— even if MFN is still the boogeyman—I'd be curious what others think.\n\n00:03:07,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right. Erica, you're on.\n\n00:03:10,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n I like it.\n\n00:03:11,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n I like it though. I'm not sure I can be.

There's no way I'm going to go all in on biotech, but um. But what he said certainly resonates. And I think I'd add on that we're just seeing good. fundamental news flow. We had a bunch of conferences this week, whether it was ULR or EHA or ERA that ended up last week, and the data sets coming from those meetings is really favorable. We had an FDA approval, as Paul kind of alluded to, that no one expected to happen this week, that it was kind of surprise approval. So that was great. We got study results even outside the medical meetings that continue to pile up in a positive way. This had to be, you know, maybe even coming off of last week and ASCO, the best maybe two weeks. string of events that we've seen in the industry in a long time— at least, you know, in my recent memory, I can't think of a better two weeks for fundamental news flow. So at the end of the day, that's what's got to drive it, right? We can't just hope that investors are going to bid up these stocks based on nothing. There has to be fundamental progress to support.\n\n00:04:17,589 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with how things have progressed on that front. Yaron, what are your thoughts?\n\n00:04:23,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I agree. So, Paul, I totally agree. I'm probably maybe a little bit between both of you. I think we've hit the bottom. And so I really like the talk. Here. The valuations are stretched to the downside. Expectations were as bad as it gets. You know, buy-take is probably not going to go into a bull market. There's no bold structural thesis here. But the news floor, good. We've had a lot of positive data. I think we're going to talk about some of them. We're seeing M&A sentiments only going to get better. You don't think MFN is going to go through? And there's some positive movement, at least from both what Prasad is saying and Makary. So, yeah, we're constructive. I would say we're constructive, probably not bullish.\n\n00:05:06,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Anyone think there's another leg down with MFN or that's generally incorporated into sentiment?\n\n00:05:15,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n It feels like there are specific stocks that.\n\n00:05:19,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n Like depending on how this looks, could be more or less hit. You know, I mean, I think, like, if you think it's a broad impact to the sector where we're talking about disaster scenario, all drugs, I feel like there's definitely fears. Pressed, uh, priced in, and, like, you know, people are maybe on the sidelines of certain names or don't want to go more overweight. So I feel like there's some priced in, but. Like, the single stock impact to me is still kind of the wild card here. Like, for example, you know, look, I cover Al Milam. I'm very bullish on Mbutura. That's not a counter-consensus take. Um, you know, we'll see, like that. Like, what if? MFN is centered around Part B drugs, right? I mean, that, like, suddenly, you know, Almilam is trading close to all-time highs. By the way, I'm not sounding the r the alarms on Almilam at all. I have no edge in this. I don't know if it's gonna center on Part B or not. But I do think that there are like nuanced scenarios with MFN where certain stocks could get hit more than others. And I think, like, that is probably priced in across the sector in the XBI.\n\n00:06:20,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, like, you know, the single stock impact, like, there's a range of outcomes.\n\n00:06:24,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n Do you all think, as Soulside analysts who generally have a predilection for biotech, just because I think it's often easier to spot those undervalued assets, that we have a skewed perspective of the index? You know, we kind of cherry pick our coverage universes and, in doing so, tend to align ourselves with those companies that we think are, you know, most undervalued.","char_start":3418,"char_end":7556,"start_time":"00:03:07","end_time":null}

Like, we don't need the entire XBI to go up. As long as we have a good, strong collection of names that really are performing well, and we have the ability to identify what those are going to be. But do you think we all approach this industry from too narrow a lens to see the big picture and that big picture? Is actually not as rosy as we think it is.\n\n00:07:19,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n It seems like that's a prompt for one of us to take the other side of the coin here.\n\n00:07:23,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n And argue that MFN is going to be the detriment of all of us.\n\n00:07:29,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, yeah, look, I'll sound the word of caution on MFN, at least. I hope I'm wrong. And I think the points that Paul and Jerome were making, that sentiment's already pretty pretty poor.\n\n00:07:42,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n And more naturally has upside, not downside.\n\n00:07:45,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Am I worried about MFN? I absolutely am. I mean, you know that the industry, sorry, this administration is going to take its pound of flesh out of. Of drug pricing, I mean that's a no-brainer. There's no way that Trump, you know, despite his threats, tantrums, and tantrums and then willingness to settle for something less, is still going to get something that he will settle for. There's no doubt that drug pricing will be impacted in a negative way by MFS. And to me, that does put us on a little bit of a slippery slope, much like um much like the IRA did. I mean, we are still suffering from that legislation.\n\n00:08:27,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n The curtailment it put on long-term drug revenues so you know we're going to have to deal with that.\n\n00:08:33,789 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm not saying it's going to be terrible. But. there is something to be said about this populistic rise against our industry. It was crazy to me to see. You know, Bernie Sanders and and RFK Jr.—uh, this week mentioned in in headlines is agreeing on direct-to-consumer advertising and hoping that it is shut down when you have the right and the left colluding almost on. An issue that that probably stirs up as much popular support as anything these days. Our industry is on the defensive and we better be careful or else this could be more than just a pound of flesh. You know, that's that's the word.\n\n00:09:12,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. Why don't we move on to some of the regulatory updates, regulatory and related, starting with Urigin. Bit of a surprise, somewhat surprise approval error.\n\n00:09:26,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, yeah. I mean, I guess yes and no. Right there's no, there's no doubt the drug, uh, UGN102.\n\n00:09:33,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n What are they now calling it?\n\n00:09:35,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n Zervidice? I can't even pronounce this word. Zer-durry?\n\n00:09:40,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's no doubt it worked. It always was viewed as an efficacious drug. They didn't do a great phase three trial design.\n\n00:09:50,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n control arm of substance in that design so that got him in some trouble at ODAC last month. And I think as many of our listeners know, the ODAC panel vote went against them five to four. So, you know, that was a close vote, but it was unfavorable.\n\n00:10:05,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n The FDA probably did what we all thought it should have done, which is turn around and approve the drug.\n\n00:10:10,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n This is for low-grade, intermediate-risk NMIBC. Josh, you know the indication, I'm sure, better than anyone on this call. So feel free to chime in here, but. They priced this drug at about $21,000 per dose. For example, it could be as much as a hundred thousand dollars plus per. per course of therapy.\n\n00:10:34,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n We expect that Sudhuri is going to go up against basically interventional procedures like Terb-T surgery.\n\n00:10:43,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n will probably be best suited for those patients who either are elderly and can't really tolerate surgery, or have a highly recurrent nature to their disease.","char_start":7256,"char_end":11504,"start_time":"00:06:51","end_time":null}

There are, I think, 59,000 total patients with low-grade intermediate risk in MIBC, so it's certainly a large market. Know hats off to the team at Eurogen for persevering and getting this one over the goal line.\n\n00:11:09,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thoughts on what it means more broadly about the FDA, as we're all kind of on Paul's point, wondering—what, whether it's going to be rosy or gloomy.\n\n00:11:20,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll let someone else opine on that. I'm not sure I have a strong view.\n\n00:11:26,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I mean, at least from my perspective, it shows the FDA is continuing to be flexible, right? It was a narrowly negative adcom, and so one might have thought that they would, again, from a very dogmatic perspective, just kind of said no and highlighting some of the concerns that the reviewer had raised. But again, it, in many ways, feels like, for the most part, business as usual.\n\n00:11:52,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe where it's not business as usual is RFK Jr. tearing to shreds the ACIP committee. and replacing them with a mishmash of, I guess, specialists I wouldn't necessarily have thought would belong on an ACIP committee. There's a psychiatrist, nutritionist, an ER specialist, an obstetric-gynecologist (ob-gyn), practitioners, some very noted vaccine skeptics.\n\n00:12:20,640 [SPEAKER_3]\n This one, I guess, in my mind, feels maybe different than. That knee-jerk reaction many had when Drs. McCary and Prasad We're announced as head of FDA and CBER, and I think those appointments are actually starting to look.\n\n00:12:38,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Quite strong, even though you know one might have looked at their track record and had some concerns. Is there anyone who's optimistic that this new ACIP committee is going to really make sound, thoughtful decisions that are in the best interest of public health policy?\n\n00:13:00,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Seems like a disaster, doesn't it?\n\n00:13:03,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n Kind of.\n\n00:13:05,299 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't know what's the bull case. I don't know. My wife and I are expecting a kid in three weeks. I'm hoping that. I'm hoping we can get some vaccines in the next couple of years. I don't know. I'm concerned. I'm concerned for the world. What do others think?\n\n00:13:22,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, what comes to mind is trying to have a dessert menu full of pastries without a pastry chef. Like, people who make steak cannot make pastry. Like, vaccines are a very specific breed of therapeutics. This is not like a regular drug. But that's definitely concerning to me. And that some of them apparently have some ties to RFK relating to the Merck litigation.\n\n00:13:47,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't know if I have the facts correctly, but that's kind of what I've been reading. That's also raising some concerns.\n\n00:13:53,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the only thing I wanted to add is there does seem to be this um increasing narrative out there around the FDA being in a good place and Macari and Prasad being pro-industry and pro-drug approvals and exerting that flexibility we just talked about on UGN 102. But yeah, this is not okay, what's happening in vaccines. It's not okay to say, well, the FDA is functional, but. and then point to the disaster that's going on in our public health system around.\n\n00:14:25,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n around RFKs and juniors' agenda for tearing apart the vaccine world. Uh, we need to be very mindful of this. Josh and I think you're right to raise it as a big, big problem and sounds like it's only going to get worse before you know, someone, something happens to unfortunately stop it. And most likely that something is going to be a public health crisis.\n\n00:14:46,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n From what I've seen, this one, to me, is the one most across the line, or at least threatening to be. Just given the potential impact, if the committee really does start to unwind vaccine practices and not really appreciate the important nuances of herd immunity, immune compromised individuals, the 'what if' scenario of, well, what if you got the infection and not the vaccine?

But we will obviously see how much we can do about it, other than raise our voices and our cumulative concern, and then hope that ultimately good sound decisions will be made. All right, maybe on to another topic. Again, ultimately— for um— for the group to opine on, we're starting to see, you know, a continued amount of investor activism against boards. We've had 8R1 send a very interesting letter to the Keros board. DeepTrack has obviously been battling Dynavax. You know, I guess it kind of raises the question, in particularly in tough times, when companies have lost investor mandates.\n\n00:16:13,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n Are boards doing enough and meeting their fiduciary duty consistently? Are shareholders being too aggressive?\n\n00:16:22,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n Any of this even matter. Paul, maybe we'll start with you and get your thoughts.\n\n00:16:29,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I don't. I don't think these investors are being too aggressive at all. Like, I. I mean, look at what happened with Third Harmonic and you know, look at the reaction, not just on the street to the stock, but also just the perception of that team and the discipline they've had. And I think those executives, you know, again, I didn't cover that stock, my colleague Alex did, but my sense is those executives will have. You know, welcome roles leading another startup because you know they made the right decision. So I mean, I don't think I think there's a number I don't want to like pick out companies and on this, but you know, I think we've seen a number of times, right, where a company goes public and they've got a lead asset that is 90-plus percent of the valuation and they got some earlier-stage stuff that investors didn't really spend much time on.\n\n00:17:21,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n The lead asset fails and they've got you know excess of capital and they're you know going to ultimately spend that capital on projects that weren't really the premise of them getting the money in the first place. And look, that's their right, right? They have the money and that's their right. But understanding that every situation is nuanced, I can totally understand why. Uh, why some investors are making pushes in certain situations like this? I have no problem with it. You're on.\n\n00:17:48,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n How about you?\n\n00:17:50,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I've actually been speaking with a few people who are involved in these situations and kind of, you know, what we're hearing is that, and Eric, please chime in, you're sort of fresh off the company.\n\n00:18:02,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n Some boards are a little— I'm concerned that if they unwind the company, are they going to kind of admit defeat and are they going to open themselves up for litigation? While we all think they have, let's say, $100 million. On the balance sheet. They have commitments that they need to unwind, contracts with employees, facilities. They do need to keep some D &O insurance and insurance in case of litigation. A hundred million is never a hundred million, but I do believe that companies should make decisions faster to terminate programs. It's okay. We all know. Most programs won't work. They need to be equally skeptical on what they have, even if it means that the alternative is to shut down. And they need to be better stewards of capital, it's going to be much better for the industry. And we can use those shells then to take the next slew of companies out, given the lack of an IPO market. So I think it's the right direction.\n\n00:18:56,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very nice.

I guess I just want to point out how how amazingly quick this trend has occurred.\n\n00:19:04,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n Josh, you remember? You and I were writing about zombie biotech companies just about three or four weeks ago, I think it was maybe. A note that we published back in February, and we were calling out many of the companies that were trading it. Well below their cash balance, who had these recent blow-ups that Paul mentioned, and were you know, still kind of willing to spend their inheritance on projects that investors hadn't really supported. With the funds that they were giving those companies. And this was not happening six months ago. No one saw any of this happening. And now, today, it's almost commonplace. It's almost fait accompli. That when a company has its main project blow up and it's got three, four, $500 million of cash. The company, as Star Harmonic does, either waves the white flag and says, 'OK, we're going to return capital' or— where someone scoops in and tends to do it for them. I do find this to be efficient capitalism. I think we have way too much capital.\n\n00:20:04,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n Held out into these shells of companies that no investors were supporting. I honestly love the trend.\n\n00:20:12,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n Eric, since you were in a company, and I guess your own too, like: If you guys were in one of these situations where you're trading at a negative enterprise value. The lead drug failed. But you have a second clinical stage asset and, like, you are, like, the CFO, like you truly believe in it. But Wall Street doesn't.\n\n00:20:32,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Like, what do you do? Like, do you go with your belief or do you listen to investors who, probably, when you're on the inside, you probably feel like they know a lot less than you do.\n\n00:20:44,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n Your own, you want to try?\n\n00:20:45,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I think it's like the company that I was in, but I kind of left before a lot of the data read out. So I can't tell you what it was like to maybe beat that seed in general in a company during when Dave Zahn takes in.\n\n00:21:00,190 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it really depends on factors.\n\n00:21:04,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n What's the level of real support and conviction around the table in that asset?\n\n00:21:11,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n And also at the board. And you could see that in some cases, you know, we have to remember that they. These people then have to go find another job. So there are situations where the people around the table have already been successful and they're very employable and it's easier for them to make the decision. They'll find another role. The people who have been less successful have probably other considerations. If there's mixed feelings on the table and the chances for success, then where's the power of balance and what is the tempo of the board? If everybody doesn't believe in the second asset, then it'd be a much easier decision.\n\n00:21:47,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n But it's complicated.\n\n00:21:50,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, and I think the onus is on the company, right? Prove to the world or to convince the world that any asset— whether it's the first asset, the second asset, or the third asset— that you're willing to spend shareholder resources on. That that asset will give you a reasonable return, right? I think the problem we've had is that they're too many companies trading well below their cash balance who failed at convincing the investment public. What they were doing made a lot of sense. Some are still failing at convincing the investment public that what they're doing makes a lot of sense. We can blame that on a downturn in the market. We can say the market's inefficient, but. To me, that's a slippery slope. Josh, I know I'm going to engage you in this debate. but you know saying that oh it's just a bear market and investors aren't aren't listening and investors are the one tuning out all this great science and and they're the ones that need to change. I think that's some. That's a tough place for a management team to hide.\n\n00:22:47,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes and no, right?

I think at the end of the day, one of the big challenges here is so much of this is subjective, right? probabilistic analysis that we do to to predict the likelihood of a drug succeeding. Is as much an art as it is a science, and so it is entirely plausible that management teams and boards, especially with more information than investors, who you know, not infrequently think they know more than they do. You know, we'll have a very different sense of probability, and then who do you defer to in that case? And do you defer to a single, agitating shareholder— even if a powerful one— or Or do you fight back? Ultimately, do you wind up compromising? Certainly, seems like something that is increasingly of importance in our industry, in part an industry that has struggled, in part an industry that wants some of that capital back.\n\n00:24:04,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n In order to um, to redeploy it and/ or simply correct some valuation discrepancies of these very negative enterprise value companies and trying to generate at least some. Immediate return on the capital. All right, maybe on to another topic— an emerging theme that we're going to talk about when I was on a couple of weeks ago, but got pulled off. And that is the topic of psychedelics. And Paul, I know this is a space that you're quite interested in. We do have some upcoming data for Compass. How are you feeling about the Compass program and psilocybin? In treatment-resistant depression and then perhaps more broadly the psychedelic field in general.\n\n00:24:52,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I think this is a space I've become so much more excited about. And if you played me a recording of that statement, like when Compass was going public, I might have not believed it, because the space has come a tremendously long way. Right, if you go back to when Compass went public.\n\n00:25:11,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n Which, you know, look, it was a promising story. There were a number of academic studies around psilocybin. There were still just an enormous amount of questions in this area, right? One being the FDA regulatory hurdle and what they're going to want for safety and trial design. Two, are these products even commercially viable? and three— this isn't a compass comment, but more of a whole space comment. You know, I think most of the companies—um, in the kind of first wave of this space— right were led by very untraditional management teams, which sometimes can be okay, but oftentimes management teams, or at least in certain cases, that had less drug development expertise, but they're trying to pioneer programs that are probably more complicated than average, right? So that's where we were. I think where we've gotten to, and I think what's made me a lot more positive on this area— is really first the success of Spravato, commercially. That's Johnson & Johnson's esketamine drug. It's not an easy drug to use. It's two hours inpatient. It's given every every other week. The efficacy is not amazing. I'm not saying it doesn't help a lot of people, but it only worked in two out of four of its clinical trials, right?","char_start":23214,"char_end":26822,"start_time":"00:22:47","end_time":null}

I'm not saying it doesn't help a lot of people, but it only worked in two out of four of its clinical trials, right?\n\n00:26:15,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it's not an amazing drug and yet it's it's selling well over a billion. You know it's growing rapidly, right? Like I think that could ultimately be a three-plus billion-dollar drug and so for a company like Compass, or companies like GH, or MindMed, or ATAI, has a 5-methoxy DMT study reading out this year too. I mean, it feels like the market has been validated. It feels like the FDA has become a lot more on board with this space, with the approval of Spravato and also with a number of these companies having pretty rigorous regulatory discussions around things like trial design and functional unblinding. And so, you know, I think ultimately the bottom line is psychedelics feel like they're going to be a real commercial drug class, right? They're going to be premium price products that are used predominantly in treatment-resistant depression or anxiety. You know you could be looking at something that is a five-plus-billion-dollar class. I don't think that's crazy. Um, you know, as it relates to Compass, I mean the setup around their Phase Three study is nuanced because, you know, I think for that stock, the investment debate does continue to center more around the commercial setup versus whether the drug works.\n\n00:27:21,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, for context, they're going to have their Phase Three data likely this month from their first of two Phase Three trials for comp. for Comp360, which is their psilocybin compound. This study is placebo-controlled, and as a result, it's generally expected to succeed, not just because the drug works, but also because, in any placebo-controlled study of a psychedelic, you have some level of functional unblinding. We're also going to get more limited disclosure at the top line because they want to preserve the integrity of their second phase three, which the control arm is not a placebo, but a sub-therapeutic dose. And so, you know, I think, as an investor or as, you know, as an analyst covering Compass, right, I mean, I'm bullish into the data because I think the data are going to be positive and I'm confident in that. But, um. But I think, you know, ultimately you have to be realistic that the investment debate here is more around how this is given. You know, eight hours in a center. Um, they have a trained therapist with the patient at most sites in these studies. It seems plausible that that's not going to be a requirement in the real world.\n\n00:28:22,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, certain things there— i think— are kind of the longer-term investment debates that aren't going to be resolved by these data. But the context is this space, felt, you know, a little science project-y. A half decade ago, and now it feels like there's a number of real companies. It should be taken seriously.\n\n00:28:38,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n What are you thinking? Any guesses on the magnitude of mattress benefit in the Compass trial?\n\n00:28:44,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's a good question, man. So, you know, for context, again, like they are going to only be disclosing the placebo-adjusted effect on Madras, right? And, you know, I think what we've seen across these psychedelic studies specifically is the magnitude of placebo response is just like enormously variable, right? Like in some of these bravado studies, even though there was quote-unquote functional and blinding, you still saw a healthy benefit on the placebo patients. Right and that benefit might just be from participating in a trial coming into a clinical center. Some level of spontaneous resolution. You contrast that with the GH phase 2 study where the placebo arm didn't improve at all. Right and you know that could be due to a variety of factors. Right, one also potentially being functional and blinding to some degree. So for psilocybin, you should have functional unblinding. Um, which should attenuate placebo response. But you know, the experience for the patient— even the person on placebo— is potentially like more involved. Right. You might get some therapeutic benefit from being at the center and being in the room and all the interactions and stuff like that.","char_start":26522,"char_end":30939,"start_time":"00:26:15","end_time":null}

You might get some therapeutic benefit from being at the center and being in the room and all the interactions and stuff like that.\n\n00:29:45,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so I guess what I'm trying to say is, like, they could put up josh a four to five point difference between drug and placebo in the top line. And some could say, 'Oh no, that's half the effect size of five million DMT in the GH study.' And what I would say is, well, we have to see what placebo did before we can really interpret that. Um, but I think, like in that ballpark, that four to five point range. I mean, that's kind of a likely base case for me, if this works, that or better. Just because I do think, ultimately, this probably will have a below average placebo response as far as MDD studies go. You know, I'm fairly confident that the drug works and, so, you know, I think mid to high mid to high single digits is probably like the right range. But again, there's a lot of There's a lot of nuance, and we're not going to know some of the key details to really making that cross-trial comparison when the press release comes out.\n\n00:30:35,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I think it's a great summary.\n\n00:30:38,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n One of the early questions as well is, you know, who's going to figure out how to deliver this, right?\n\n00:30:46,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Psychiatrist offices. It's a room to see a patient in a waiting room. Where on earth are you going to find— a room or suite of rooms— to deliver this care to patients.\n\n00:30:58,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n All along, Compass kind of said, 'it's building itself,' it's building itself. And lo and behold, it's absolutely building itself. I am literally looking out my window across the street at what used to be a convenience store, and now it's an interventional psychiatry behavioral health clinic. Right? That's crazy, man. Is that right? What is going on here? But I think it reflects the fact that psychiatrists— I think— realized that they've partly been practicing pseudo medicine because they just haven't really had anything meaningful to offer these patients outside of, you know, some modestly efficacious medications that also have some pretty significant side effects, maybe not life-threatening side effects, but certainly. Life-altering side effects. And so now that they have within their grasp something to provide patients to really transform their lives.\n\n00:31:54,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n Why wouldn't you adapt your practice and clinic and kind of figure out a way? How you can deliver these a little bit more. You know, intensive type monitoring therapies, but with ideally the benefit of just really transforming lives. In ways that that they really do um aspire to, so yeah very much looking forward to the the compass data and a stream of catalysts like you know, a lot of this has been in the works for some time and and now we are starting to see the late stage clinical trials reading out. To your point about Spravato. A therapy that's not the easiest to administer, because you've got to keep going back to the office to weekly or every other week basis, the time to administer it, the travel time, the travel costs. And yet, it's you know, it's grown like a weed. It's amazing, man.\n\n00:32:46,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's really amazing. I mean, I think the last thing is just—you know, a lot of these centers figured out how to turn this into a business. A clinic across the street from you or even, you know, Mass General Hospital, right? If anyone's ever been in MGH, it's so big.\n\n00:33:02,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, you know, has so many different groups it almost feels like being in an airport in that lobby, and yet they figured out, you know, how to turn bravado, as I understand it, like into a into a revenue driver. Right. And you know, and that's going to have to play out with all of these individually. There's some concern that, with the longer duration of psychedelics, you might not be able to flow as many patients through the center in a day, but it's actually unclear if that's really going to impact the economics. And so, without going down that rabbit hole, I mean. You know, the money piece of it always helps.","char_start":30639,"char_end":34965,"start_time":"00:29:45","end_time":null}

All right, let's move on to some of the other important news of the week, starting with Avidity. Eric, what do we learn about FSHD and their regulatory path?\n\n00:33:45,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, kind of a multifaceted update from from the folks at. The video of Adele Brax for This is obviously a disease that has no approved therapies.\n\n00:34:00,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n It is quite progressive, so lots of unmet medical need here. I guess what we heard was: number one, that the fda is open to a potential accelerated approval pathway, though maybe there's some still some work that needs to be done there. Number two, that the company has started its confirmatory phase three study, an outcomes-based study. Number three, that the phase one new data extended data set, including longer-term follow-up, looked really good. The streets seem to focus on number one, maybe not getting quite what it wanted from the accelerated approval discussion that the company has had with the FDA at this point in time. Clearly, the FDA is open to accelerated approval. But I think the company is still kind of working out some of the supportive data sets that it needs to file on a Dux4 biomarker endpoint. And I expect they'll get there. And I expect that when they do file late next year for accelerated approval, the drug's going to be approved. But, what I think may be missed by Wall Street investors, the stock having been down this week, was the really consistent data that we saw.\n\n00:35:07,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n In terms of clinical and, for that matter, biomarker outcomes from the Phase 1-2 study. I was very impressed. This is a slowly progressive disease, the disease that can move down stochastically, sort of randomly. And two in a relatively small cohort of patients, 35, 40 patients over. course of 12 months to be able to see that consistency across multiple different physician and patient reported. clinical benchmarks of disease and also biomarker objective benchmarks of disease. I mean, that just tells me this thing works.\n\n00:35:42,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n To me, our probability of success for this drug should go up meaningfully higher as an investment community. We just haven't seen that price into the stock. But Paul and Josh, I know you guys know this one well too, so. chime in.\n\n00:35:56,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n It just feels like again, like we said earlier. Right. I mean, this is one of a number of catalysts that we've gotten, in the past month or two. And obviously, in the six months before that, when Peter Mark's days were right— where we're getting regulatory alignment—along with the degree of flexibility. I mean, totally, you know, Unicure's alignment in Huntington's recently. And this one is one I've been watching closely for. Not just for avidity in this FSHD program, which could be a really big drug if it works out, but also for just the DM1 space because there's an odd. Sort of a typical scenario there with Ability pursuing this full approval path and Dyne pursuing an accelerated approval path on a DMPK biomarker. With clinical data and it feels like the receptivity here. Probably has some positive read through to the potential receptivity there and we should know soon.\n\n00:37:03,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thank you.\n\n00:37:06,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n Josh, did we lose you?\n\n00:37:10,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n You did. I was talking to myself on mute. So I was just moving on to the Innsmed data update. A big week for that company and Will Lewis, the CEO, is on quite a run.\n\n00:37:23,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n The data for their TPIP inhaled prostacyclin analog for pulmonary hypertension looking quite good. Delivered as a once-a-day administration, in contrast to United Therapeutics' blockbuster Tyveso, which is three times a day. Um. Let's see if anyone knows a little bit of history on this one, because if you recall, Tyveso is a three times a day. And held prostacyclin at one point was competing with another company that I think was delivering. And held. Iliprost four times a day or more.

No, crickets.\n\n00:38:09,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n It was Cotherix's Ventavis, and just perhaps a reminder that for these inhaled therapies, that can take up to 10 minutes for each session to to inhale the ability to reduce the number of times that a patient has to do that. Can be very powerful in terms of claiming market share. What was also interesting about Insmed now—um, know this is this is going to be a pretty large company; it's close to 20 billion market cap and Adam Feuerstein from STAT was kind of commenting on that. Wondering, you know, is this is the company just too big to be acquired?\n\n00:38:49,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then, and then it's not a bad thing or a good thing for biotech? Are we ever going to stop talking about pharma M&A as an important driver of stock performance and maybe start getting behind these companies that might ultimately kind of become, perhaps, the next Regeneron or even even bigger? Anyone have any thoughts as to um why we are so M&A obsessed as opposed to large company building obsessed?\n\n00:39:22,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I agree with you. We need Vertex, Regeneron, Celgene, Alnylon, Argenix.\n\n00:39:31,830 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know the companies that, but these companies all had one thing in common—right? They had a sizable first product that then allowed them to develop a pipeline underneath and become a large cap. Um, so I think the the obsession might be warranted for the smaller companies that really need a bigger partner. But for those who can really make it on their own, I'd say you know, fly the armada and sail across the ocean. Acceleron, to me, was one that I still believe he was ashamed that he was acquired again. No offense to Merc, but I think they would have done fantastically on their own. Um, but um, you know, we probably need both. Is kind of the way I'm thinking about it.\n\n00:40:12,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and I would say that the more we have larger biopharma companies in theory, the more acquisitive they will be, perhaps, of the companies that don't necessarily have the type of assets or portfolios to turn into a very large acquirer on their own.\n\n00:40:31,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sorry, Paul, what were you going to say?\n\n00:40:33,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, yeah, I mean, I think I think the interesting M&A piece, and you guys, I'd love your perspective on this too, is just that like, it feels like. Investors.\n\n00:40:44,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n They don't. Like, you know, stocks in this space are not really valued on DCF. Like they are, but they aren't, right? It's almost like, I feel like as a sell-side analyst, I have to have one. But I also know that when I talk to people about valuation, it's often It can be a little bit hand-wavy, right? You know, peak sales, multiple comps, things like that. And so I think in the context of that, like. You know, the possibility of M&A, even if that possibility is like a couple percent, it just. It almost just helps put a company into a different. Valuation conversation right. And you know Josh. You and I and I think your own— actually too—er. Eric, you might have even covered this at one point when you were a cow and like Ionis, right? Ionis has built like pretty impressive company. They've got a number of programs, they've got a number of shots on goal. It feels like, because that company is seen as an extremely low likelihood target, that it's not going to get that valuation premium that many people hope it should. And so, you know, right or wrong, I feel like it's not just about you know, investors feeling like they need an exit.\n\n00:41:50,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's also just feeling like, for biotech, for the risk that you take on, you almost need a couple percent chance of that dream case at least to sort of justify everything else. That's my gut feeling.\n\n00:42:03,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n No. Any other thoughts on that?\n\n00:42:06,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, how ironic that Ionis is the one company that binds us all together.\n\n00:42:12,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah.\n\n00:42:13,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n That is awesome.\n\n00:42:15,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, Ionis, you know, we all wait for the next 12 to 18 months where the golden age of Ionis is coming.

They're smart drug developers, but it's fascinating how the psychology of these things can be an overhang for a very long time.\n\n00:42:38,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, Paul's comment is so interesting, right? We build these DCF analyses and think that that's the right way to value really. any company and then we throw out the towel because it doesn't seem like companies actually trade around DCF fundamentals.\n\n00:42:57,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n So there seems something a little- wrong or off about that if if a company is not worth the cash that it can likely generate.\n\n00:43:07,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n um, attend to. almost any company in any other industry and how they're valued.\n\n00:43:14,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n shouldn't they be? What's the reason to not?\n\n00:43:25,959 [SPEAKER_0]\n Look, I don't know if you can hear me. What I struggle with with a DCF is.\n\n00:43:31,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is that everybody does a DCF in a different way and so much of it is the long-term value I don't even know how people look at working capital, right? Because that should be a part of the DCF. And of course, what we all use as a discount rate is highly sensitive than really what we think apply the future cash flow. flows and forget about capex— it's just there's so much subjectivity that I think DCF is so challenging. I think in some ways, if you think about it, if you're trying to model a financial company, a bank, how do you possibly figure out what is their earnings? going to be in five years. Impossible, I would argue. At least with biotech, you can figure out what the five-year outlook looks like, and then you can apply multiple based on growth. So I tend to think that a PE is a better way to do it. We do these CFs, but I just don't have a huge amount of confidence in them. That's just kind of our view.\n\n00:44:22,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n Eric, what's your approach?\n\n00:44:24,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I guess, as you know, Josh, for these development stage companies at least, I think valuation is a fool's game. I agree with your own. It's kind of garbage in, garbage out. What really, really, really matters is whether the drug works or not, right? And that's a black or white outcome. Drugs either work and they're probably worth more money. Then they're weight and gold and will grow and grow and grow and succeed and change medicine and benefit patients. Where they don't and they're zeros. So we should spend a lot less time as a community working out models that are fictitious. A lot more time doing due diligence on what's going to work.\n\n00:45:01,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right, maybe next topic, Jeroen, do you want to take us through the Ascendus Coach data?\n\n00:45:07,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and chime in too, Josh. You're an expert here. So this is, for the audience, this is Ascendus tested their Transcon CNP.\n\n00:45:17,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n Drug just filed for chondroplavipiduphan November 30. And uniquely, they decided to also bridge it, marry it to their own growth hormone. Growth hormone is not the standard of care for patients with chondroplasia because, as you know, they have an FGFR issue in their bone. Their bones are not normal. So if you give them growth hormone, they benefit, but it's not.\n\n00:45:39,840 [SPEAKER_0]\n They're not fixing the underlying issue, so they said, 'Why don't we put them together?' There was no control, so we had to look at historical controls, and everybody came off their TransCon C &P alone. The data was very provocative. 21 patients. They showed essentially an increase in the annual growth trajectory and also the body proportionality. As many people know, achondroplasia, have normal body proportionality.\n\n00:46:06,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n So the data was very intriguing. It looks better than Transcon alone in the past.

Sogo from Biomarin.\n\n00:46:15,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bridge Bio is an oral FGFR, pen FGFR drug, which looks really, really good. We're waiting for the phase three data late this year. The combination now looks even better than that, and it looks like even on body proportionality the data continues to get better. We only but we are looking at 26 weeks now and that data already looks as good as you know the 52 week data from the previous therapies. So the next step is to do a phase three.\n\n00:46:43,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n They're going to do CNP alone, plus or minus growth hormone. They're not going to test growth hormone alone because that's obviously not approved there. The big question is ultimately: is? As we all know, patients who have short stature, they're kids, they're only usually on two years chronically for life and so naturally the question is going to be: should a patient be on growth hormone with CNP for a year? Is it chronic? There is some data out there historically that suggests that patients typically benefit for one year on growth hormone chondroplasia, and then they don't lose the benefit. Two years onwards, they don't really benefit further. So it's going to be a one-year study, but it'll be interesting to see whether FDA is going to say, 'Hey, just remember for Voxogo.' FDA said, 'We really want to see your two-year data to get you approved.' That was the first C &P replacement. And whether FDA is going to want two-year data here too. I don't know.\n\n00:47:43,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's interesting because my impression was that the BOM were in two-year data. Ask stems from the historical issues where growth hormone in this disease might have a short-term benefit, but tolerate out over time. Isn't that right?\n\n00:47:59,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n That is totally correct, absolutely.\n\n00:48:02,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. Okay. What do you guys like? I actually have a question because I cover Bob Moran and it's been such a tough story. And it's like. stuck in like a Alexion-like universe of the undisprovable bear case with Ascendus and, you know, the pipelines lacking and all this kind of stuff. Like, how. How do you guys think about? the Ascendus launch because I feel like there's really two credible sides of it. The one side is just, hey, we've got a once-weekly drug that maybe is clinically better, maybe not. Like, why would anyone take a once-daily drug? And then on the other hand, like you look at, even the growth hormone space, right? With how the once-weeklies originally launched, you look at. You know, you look at like hemophilia with long actings, and then you think about just, you know, the global nature of the chondroplasia market. And you could also, I think, make a pretty strong case that Bauer might be much more resilient than people think. I only cover Bomber and I don't cover Ascendus, but I just I get the sense from the investor community that. Um. This is a super polarizing topic and would love to hear your guys' perspective.\n\n00:49:03,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it seems like a common theme that we encounter in biotech: right when you have an incumbent, entrenched player, and there's something shiny and new coming along that maybe investors and even the physician community is enthusiastic about. And everyone's nervous and very paranoid that the entrenched player is going to rapidly lose market share. Oftentimes, they don't, for various reasons. But then sometimes they do. And so, how on earth do you really kind of know when that entrenched player has some stickiness versus not? Aside from just trying to do a lot of diligence, I guess in this case, at least for the checks that we have done for this patient population with specialists, we hear—um, you know— not not that much enthusiasm, a little nonplussed for Voxelgo, because they lament that it's a daily injection, and it's a daily injection for kids.\n\n00:50:05,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n Who don't want any injections, nor do parents ever want to have to inject their kid with a needle.

I think that goes without saying. And on top of that, they're a little underwhelmed with the efficacy that they're seeing with Vox Sogo.\n\n00:50:20,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n When we did the checks, we certainly picked up— a high degree of enthusiasm for Bridges and Fagratinib, assuming that it stays safe and competitive on its efficacy profile.\n\n00:50:33,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n As an oral option for kids.\n\n00:50:37,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think anyone who's ever had to inject themselves with a needle probably realizes that it's not. I mean, if you have to, you do it. That's fine. Like, probably better than, you know, having a disease go untreated. If you could have a pill instead, in many cases, that actually, from a patient's perspective, would be preferable. And then you just magnify that quite substantially when it comes to kids, of course, who would certainly prefer. Uh, appealed to, um, Twin needles. So, you know, our, our checks do suggest that Voxogo does have vulnerability and that's probably why.\n\n00:51:15,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, do you point out that that's been an overhang? On the stock. Is it possible that this becomes a setting where Biomarin can kind of defend its territory by highlighting long-term safety data, etc. You know, it's nothing's ever absolute. And I think one of the things we struggle with the most is when it comes time to predicting not just the size of a market, but how it's going to split among different agents. How introduction of new options into a field can potentially expand the field by bringing more patients onto therapy. With or without necessarily cannibalizing others that are already there, but I think, from our view, again, very positive feedback that we've heard on Infogratnet. Primarily because the docs that we've spoken to, like the profile, the efficacy, the tolerability, and very much appreciate it being an oral option. I'm not sure if you've heard something different.\n\n00:52:15,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, totally. I, you know, that's the drug that we've been following. So our colleague Tyler, as you know, excuse me, Cover Bridge. And we've been following that program through Ascendus, thinking that could be the winner.\n\n00:52:31,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n What's interesting is that they're going to have data late this year, as you know, so they're going to be on the market, I don't know, late next year. Oral option could be really great for new patients. I guess the question is these. Which we think Biomarin is obviously going to lose share. And then the question is going to be, what do you do when the CNP-Skytropha data shows up? And does that change things again, as two weeklies that they say they can co-formulate? So that'll be interesting. And then, of course, there's hypochondriplasia and all the other indications, right? By Moran is talking about a billion going to five billion. So that's.\n\n00:53:07,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n good for everybody.\n\n00:53:08,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Right. Well, it's just crazy that Biomarin gave long-term guidance a couple of weeks before this to send us data. Right. I mean, that's. You know, like I know they talk about how they've, you know, they've incorporated competition and they've gone back and done the work, but like it's. Like it's tough, tough timing, tough luck for them.\n\n00:53:27,259 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, agreed. All right. Well, maybe at another point, Paul, we'd love to hear your thoughts about whether they can buy more in block ascendance through the International Trade Court?

I'll write Roche and Mercera, Imgen and Mercera from Roche. Yeah, I don't know.\n\n00:53:44,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's like two so obviously I have like no idea. I feel like IP stuff is so hard. Um, I mean, look, they send us challenges against the bomber in Europe, and that patent was, uh, the key patent was narrowed, but like, there's still claims right that like have kind of an argument probably on both sides as to whether ascendance infringes it. I mean, We've done some patent calls, and they've said, 'Hey, like, you know, Biomarin's got a real case here,' but it's always so hard to handicap. I mean, I feel like for Biomarin stock, it certainly doesn't give option value to the scenario, but blocking is really, really hard. In the US, you know, I mean, one nuance here, and again, I know maybe we want to cover other topics, but like, I just think this is so interesting, I guess, since you guys cover Ascendus is, I was really surprised that Ascendus got priority review, you know, because again, going back to your comment, your own, we've been talking about whether Ascendus is going to need the two-year data for approval, and instead they get priority review. And to me, that suggests that the FDA is not looking at that as merely a convenience product, right? That could also feed into this IP piece as well.\n\n00:54:47,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Like, you know, if, if, if Ascendus can make, you know, they're going to make their argument their own data, but if they can actually make a regulatory based argument. That it's not just a me too that probably makes it, you know, more challenging for Pomerant to block them. Did you guys think anything of that priority review?\n\n00:55:04,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n That was definitely um definitely interesting that definitely caught my eye um.\n\n00:55:10,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I got to tell you, we immediately thought that Biomarin is now going to set a new precedent that FDA is comfortable with this mechanism and that they're not going to require two-year data. But you bring up a good point, the priority review. Might be another angle.\n\n00:55:25,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah.\n\n00:55:27,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right, I think we're at final minutes here. I do want to touch on some of the EULAR updates, in particular, Cabaletta BIOS. CAR T for myositis, scleroderma, and lupus nephritis that had a very strong showing at Ular. This is one of those scenarios, maybe not unlike the psychedelic field where it feels like the buzz in the patient and physician community is far, far greater than the buzz in the investment community.\n\n00:56:02,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um. Anyone with any thoughts as to why that may be the case in this context now for the CAR-T field, which, you know, it's not been the smoothest ride, but it does seem to be. kind of loving leveling out now in a way that does appear poised to deliver meaningful value to patients.\n\n00:56:21,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Eric, I know this is a field that you've kind of kept an eye on.\n\n00:56:24,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I mean, I guess, look. I'm a big fan of what they're what Steve and his team are trying to do at Cabellet as are you, right? And I believe that. they're showing something that's never been seen before in these very, very severe and difficult to treat patients with all sorts of rheumatologic disorders. So good for them for fighting this charge. I also understand, to some extent at least, why investors are not yet on board. And it's because of the capital issue right i mean we just saw the company take in Unfortunately, it was forced probably to take in, but take in $100 million at a fairly low valuation, and that's going to. Uh, you know, be very dilutive for their future shareholders, so that's the mindset we're in right now with Wall Street. Maybe, maybe this is a short-term, inefficient market as we were talking earlier today. Maybe, maybe we should have more enthusiasm, but it's it's a little bit like a vicious cycle right now for all these cell therapy companies.

To get to those milestones and to get closer to market where they can start to make money. That's my only consideration, but Jeroen, I don't know if you have different thoughts.\n\n00:57:40,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I agree. I mean, this is still early, right? But seven out of eight responses across several types of myositis was definitely very encouraging. Um, they're working through the kinks. These are refractory patients.\n\n00:57:54,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, that market is going to be a growth market. There's a lot of innovation there with the FCRNs. There's an nephron beta antibody. There's upcoming phase three from Berpracitinib from Roivin, from Matt Glein, our colleague on the show, who's featured routinely. That data is potentially coming in September. So patients are going to start having a lot of innovation. And CAR-T is going to be a great option for those who are pretty refractory. And that data is definitely encouraging. And again, kudos to Steve. I know it's not been easy. And he's been doing a nice job shepherding through.\n\n00:58:28,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n I trained in rheumatology and can certainly attest to the unmet need in myositis and then, probably, one of the absolute biggest needs in rheumatology and just in general that one of those indications investors for whatever reason just haven't. Given the time of day is scleroderma systemic sclerosis that is, that can be a very, very, very troubling disease with high morbidity and mortality. Some of the early data coming out of the CAR T experience is very promising. Now, one of the things that I always find interesting is trying to find those potential sleeper programs where you know maybe there is some early exciting proof of concept and yet you know, investors are just preoccupied with other later stage programs and missing a big opportunity.\n\n00:59:17,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n Another one that comes to mind, actually, back to our conversation on psychedelics, is Compass and PTSD. No one ever talks about PTSD, Paul. I'm not sure if you've got a view as to that unmet need and the potential role of psilocybin, but that data has been.\n\n00:59:33,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n You yeah, I mean, look it looks like it works right, and there's also just a number of other studies in PTSD too that sort of support this reset effect of psychedelics. I mean, Compass has.\n\n00:59:45,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think investors just look at on paper what's the biggest market, right? I mean, depression is just so, you know, it's so much bigger that I feel like if people feel like PTSD might just be sort of like, more of the upside thing. But uh, I'm with you man.\n\n01:00:01,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, and similar to scleroderma and lupus, right? Like, one of the indications does have a number of treatment options for patients to cycle through until they get to. You know, new innovative therapies, whereas scleroderma, PTSD, really nothing approved for them and as such, perhaps.","char_start":58310,"char_end":61685,"start_time":"00:57:24","end_time":null}

I'm Chris Garabedian and my co-hosts today are Daphne Zohar, Sam Fazzelli, Tess Cameron, Paul Matisse, and Tim Opler. Um, again, thank you for joining in. Let's start with kind of general sentiment. Sam and I were just chatting with this a little bit, but Tim. I mean, your reports are always a must read every week and you follow this stuff closely. And I did. Note that you spoke to Brad on biotechtv at bio.\n\n00:00:35,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n decidedly upbeat, especially on the m a but would love to hear uh.\n\n00:00:38,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n You kick off with kind of the general sentiment uh over the last two weeks since uh biotech hangout met last Yeah, so the XBI is down for the year. but up massively since Liberation Day. So it's all a matter of perspective. So if you were to back up the clock to April the 8th, the famous liberation day. you know, sentiment after that was just completely disastrous. And I would say today's sentiment is mixed to positive. And specifically what you'll see is it depends very much on the fund. In my last weekly report, I likened it to the old Star Trek episodes where Captain Kirk would like land on a different planet. Every week and you know, sometimes the planets were good and sometimes they weren't. So we're seeing the same thing with investors Tess and I. We attended an event this week hosted by Royalty Parma, which was awesome, by the way. And there were several investor panels. And Tess was quite interesting to see the differences in sentiment. So, like, one investor was like super negative.\n\n00:01:41,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n And then others were more positive.\n\n00:01:44,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n And it depends very much, I think, on you know the type of investor and how that how they saw the world. So I would say overall sentiment has improved and specifically, uh, what's I think very important right now is that both IPOs and follow-ons are performing well. So early in the year, those were not doing well at all, uh, since liberation day, the average IPO stock uh that went out earlier this year is up like 50– 60 and follow-ons are also performing quite well. The other thing that's really weird right now is that China biotech is just killing it. So like last month, China biotech was up almost 40%. Uh, and so you know, whatever we don't have they've got right now, and uh, you know, if you talk about sentiment, you kind of have to mention China as well.\n\n00:02:33,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Hey, Tim, I'm just curious for the decidedly bearish view. From the royalty pharma meeting was that a public, uh, investor or a private investor?\n\n00:02:42,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n It was from, uh, Samsara. So, Samsara, uh, screening Akaraju is, is, uh, does both privates and publics, and so you know, he's, he's obviously, um, experiencing the challenges facing a private VC right now, which is it's really hard to raise money as a private VC right now. Like, you can have a company that discovered the last Dutchman gold mine under your headquarters, and you still like struggle to get money raised. It's just very tough for the privates, and then the public's, you know, he's obviously experienced the full brunt of Liberation Day, so you can imagine his sentiment was different. We also heard from, like, Rajiv Kahl at Fidelity. We heard from Rebecca Sykes at Wellington. And they were much more positive. And that's because they have a funding base that can kind of write through the ups and downs. But I wouldn't describe them as rosy either. I mean, it was— it was.\n\n00:03:37,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n they were optimistic, very much optimistic about what they heard it ADA. That was very exciting.","char_start":0,"char_end":3787,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770_chunk_0001","doc_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770","order":1,"text":"ore positive. And that's because they have a funding base that can kind of write through the ups and downs.

That was very exciting.\n\n00:03:44,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, my interpretation is obviously the public markets will lead us out of this ultimately and make the VCs feel more comfortable that they can get to some exits. When a lot of VCs let's just throw a number out, they might be sitting on 15– 20. Thank you. Private investments they definitely know that they're not going to make all those public. And so I think that's where the pain is being felt more on the private venture side, just because there's so much that is hard to get to a liquidity event or an exit—uh— in this current environment. Um, and then on the China trade, I'm just curious: do you see it almost like an inverse correlation? Like, things looked really bad with us, and we got to get our ducks in a row. So the feeling that you know, this is an advantage or an opportunity for China to fill the gap— is that part of this?\n\n00:04:33,390 [SPEAKER_4]\n It shouldn't be. I mean, in theory, we should all kind of go up and down at the same time.\n\n00:04:39,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n Industry. I mean, what's happening in China is they don't have Trump, so they don't have that source of uncertainty. They don't have high interest rates, so all the things that have come have impacted our sector, have not impacted China. Then they have the the wonderful tailwind of, you know, big pharma starting to buy into China. You know, we just keep hearing more and more rumors of, like, these 500 million dollar plus deals coming for China. So you know, we're going to see more of those coming in the weeks and months ahead. And so the Chinese investors know that because they all talk to each other using this thing called WeChat.\n\n00:05:17,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know that the markets are just very very excited in China right now.\n\n00:05:23,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Hey, Tim, can I just jump in on that? There's a couple of other things I'd add to, sorry, Chris, to Tim's comments. Uh, there's.\n\n00:05:32,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n The Chinese government is supportive of biotech. that's I think that was embedded in what Tim said, but there's one other element too. In the US, one of the biggest drivers of S&P 500's massive performance is the Mach 7. And they have been on it here. NVIDIA is knocking on $4 trillion market cap.\n\n00:05:54,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that is not really available to this extent in China. They have AI companies, there's lots of tech, but it's not the same. And biotech is in a younger place in terms of its position. It's not a 40-year sector. I think those are also considerations that help, especially when they keep pumping out the drugs, as Tim says, 'sell off for $500 million upfront.'\n\n00:06:27,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, that's great. So we haven't met for two weeks as biotech hangout. One week of that was bio, and I'm going to have Daphne talk to that. Daphne, anything else to comment on the market sentiments or China?\n\n00:06:38,790 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, so maybe I'll start with China and then I'll talk about bio. So I think Chinese biotech is a huge problem for small and mid-sized biotechs in the U. S. because a company can be working on a novel target, spending years and money to advance it, and then, in China, they can quickly move a copycat asset forward and then you see, as they know to Tim and Sam, a big pharma company paying a fraction to buy that asset or company compared to what they would pay in the U. S. And that trend is now also impacting startups with VCs going to China to buy assets. I heard that Umer Rafat is taking a bunch of public investors to China on a tour. And what I heard in particular from a number of public biotech CEOs that this is one of the biggest problems they're facing. Because investors are applying a huge discount in areas where the China threat is real. And one aspect of that is big pharma companies and investors— I think— need to consider carefully how the excitement around China and Chinese assets and the speed of development intersects with the current administration's messaging.","char_start":3489,"char_end":7773,"start_time":"00:03:37","end_time":null}

So I understand there are a number of proposals being discussed, including incentives for doing deals with US biotechs and also penalties for advancing China assets. And one quote I heard was, 'all those pharma companies doing deals with China are going to drop those assets like hot potatoes soon.' So I do think. I don't know how much weight I'd put into that one quote, but I do think we need to recognize there's some hype here. And in the meantime, a smart investor or pharma dealmaker should view the opportunity with a balanced lens.\n\n00:08:22,700 [SPEAKER_5]\n So in terms of bio, bio was in Boston this week. And. was as usual very big conference there was around 22,000 participants, around 50% actually notably being international with 70 countries represented. and lots of partnering meetings, the vibe was mixed. The capital drought, which was mentioned here, both private and public, being a major overhang, and everyone navigating the uncertainty and looming threats that have weighed down the sector. So, you know, threats like most favored nation or MFN pricing, tariffs, China, and a need for clarity and consistency from FDA.\n\n00:09:04,370 [SPEAKER_5]\n On the positive side, there are some opportunities as the new administration takes shape. So they have Their stated priorities: increased speed to market, removing red tape. Excitement around cell and gene therapy, and AI in drug development.\n\n00:09:19,350 [SPEAKER_5]\n So I know there's some big and justified concerns regarding vaccine policy, but from a small and mid-sized biotech perspective, the administration has put out some, I think, very encouraging messages. RFK posted on X that Maha also includes Maba. or make American biotech accelerate. He particularly called out that we need to stop giving an edge to foreign interests and large incumbents, which I read as negative for China assets and big pharma. And then FDA Commissioner McCary announced this new national priority voucher, which sounds intriguing and is a nice testament to the FDA's commitment to moving medicines through regulatory review. More quickly, but we need to better understand the criteria, considerations, and process for granting and using vouchers. The vouchers. And then. I am on the board of BIO and I see several people in the audience that are also on the board of BIO. So, from a bio perspective, in addition to pushing back on threats like MFN and tariffs, Bio has been working on a few priorities in this one big, beautiful bill, including R&D, immediate tax deduction.\n\n00:10:31,360 [SPEAKER_5]\n So that would allow for the immediate deduction of R&D costs. I don't know how many of you have been following this, but over the past few years, companies couldn't deduct R&D in one swoop. Rather, it had to be amortized. You get a ridiculous situation where, for example, you get partnering income for R&D and that could be taxable if you can't deduct the expense that year.\n\n00:10:51,180 [SPEAKER_5]\n BIO also continues to push for reauthorization of the SBIR program, which Congress needs to reauthorize by the end of September. And then additional top priorities include educating administration and Congress on the negative impacts of tariffs and offense. Industry is going to be watching closely to see if there's an MFN amendment in the reconciliation bill.\n\n00:11:13,270 [SPEAKER_5]\n Lastly, BIO has been encouraging Congress to pass the pediatric review voucher authorization, reauthorization, and this program costs taxpayers nothing and has significant bipartisan support. We also hope that the Orphan Cures Act will stay in the bill. It would allow for additional indications of an orphan, rare only, drug. And we heard that that might be at risk of being removed so Push to let people let their congressmen know that that's important.","char_start":7473,"char_end":11694,"start_time":"00:07:44","end_time":null}

Now, also, as the week of bio, right, McCary also was part of the listening tour in Boston. I know these were somewhat closed meetings and very structured. And actually, I had a colleague who attended the Washington, D. C. at DIA and heard comments. Uh and she came away with a positive take, generally speaking. But any comments on the listening tour and then, uh, we'll go to Paul for kind of a specific action. Uh, uh, that was perceived that McCary made on Cal Vista, but, but any general comments on just summarizing the listening kind of sessions that took place.\n\n00:12:21,450 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, yeah. So I had a chance to meet both Makary and Prasad, who came across to me as earnest. Very well informed, motivated to work with industry. The in-person Prasad, I think, is very different from the one some of us have gotten to know on social media. I think an outsider perspective has some benefits. There were over 100 CEOs in attendance. We each had a minute on the clock to make comments in the general session. Some of the key themes, which I think we heard back from FDA, that they're very interested in. Our desire for regulatory reform. Focus on speed and efficiency.\n\n00:12:56,570 [SPEAKER_5]\n They want to address cultural and structural issues at FDA, like removing silos and hierarchies, transparency and flexibility.\n\n00:13:05,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n Which some of this is going to speak to the next point, I guess. Surrogate endpoints and real-world data and maintaining US leadership in biomedicine. I'll give you one example that is like a flavor for the tactical ideas that they seem interested in implementing. They're calling it a one-card or two-card system where each sponsor has a card they can use to request an immediate response or clarification during the FDA interaction. So this is to address the lack of clarity sponsors sometimes experience in the long, cumbersome, and bureaucratic process to get answers while companies burn in cash. So that was my thought— a really interesting example, but there's a lot more that was discussed.\n\n00:13:46,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great. Paul, obviously in the news, McCary, everybody on the concern side is the politicization of decisions around coming out of FDA and influence from the commissioner. And his appointees. So you want to comment on what's going on with Cal Vista and the controversy there?\n\n00:14:06,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, sure. Thanks, Chris. So, um, yeah, I mean, I think, just in general, just to bridge up the investor sentiment conversation, I mean, I think The market is telling this story too. I think investors more or less have become a lot more comfortable with FDA risks to the sector outside of the vaccine space, of course. If we just think about the past few months, and, you know, a lot of the public commentary from McCary and Prasad that, you know, especially in like the rare disease space and the gene therapy space, that, you know, sounds kind of more like Peter Marks than not, right? So I think, in general, the perception is mostly good with the caveat that I think investors are watching a number of the upcoming decisions in RARE and certain decisions that center around flexibility to try to figure out the true direction and where this FDA stands on the spectrum. The really odd piece of news, though, and I know we're going to talk about Capricor as well. And, you know, I think that there's some thematic overlap there, even though it's a really different situation. But the interesting news that came out this week from Endpoints, who had multiple sources in this reporting, described a situation where Calvista, who's developing an oral drug for acute treatment in hereditary angioedema, Calvista came out a few weeks ago and said that the FDA had notified them that\n\n00:15:18,840 [SPEAKER_0]\n they're not going to meet their PDUFA goal date because of resource constraints. And this was what the language that Covus are using in their press release. And, you know, Covus is a microcap company. So, you know, they have to say something, right?","char_start":11394,"char_end":15791,"start_time":"00:11:46","end_time":null}

So, you know, they have to say something, right?\n\n00:15:32,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n from just a materiality perspective. And I think the interpretation by myself and most investors was that that product is still very likely to get approved. The data really aren't that controversial. There's a lot of drugs approved for this indication that sort of give us analogs. And they had said that they were pretty deep in labeling discussions. So it was a surprise this past week when Endpoints reported that that Macri had essentially told the review team to issue Cal Vista. A CRL. And the initial reporting was a little bit, it was a little bit like inferential, because, you know, it was, it was, I think, citing folks at the FDA who did not directly hear that this order came from Macri, but said that they knew that it did. And now there's actually an updated piece that came out this morning with more reporting on this topic. Topic. And so, I mean, look, I think it's an interesting situation. I think, from a practical perspective, for Calvista, you know, I cover the stock. We still think that drug is very likely to get approved. And I think, if there actually truly was any sort of political impetus to give it a CRL, I think that, that's probably even less likely now that that's been reported.\n\n00:16:40,830 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is really you know why would this happen was if this did happen was this because you know that the commissioner felt like it would be better to give this a CRL than you know have a delay and what the optics of that are it's really hard to speculate but I think you know back to what you were saying Chris and you know we'll talk about the Capricorn situation as well I mean, it does raise the concern around politics at the FDA, right? And I think, you know, when I talk to investors about know, a certain basket of biotech companies that have these very favorable FDA agreements some of which they've kind of attained with the prior FDA and then may or may not have reaffirmed with this new FDA. I mean, I think everyone sort of has heard on the listening tour what Macri and Prasad have been saying, and it all sounds great. But there still is a little bit of an unease as we head into maybe, you know, a year and a half of a bunch of important regulatory reviews in PDUPAs. Just as it relates to, again, like, you know, we've heard what they've said. They've said all the right things. They sound like they're a partner to industry and innovation. But where do they stand on the spectrum, right? Because ultimately, a lot of the reviews that are upcoming are subjective, flexibility is subjective, right?\n\n00:17:46,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n And so, know the composite thing is in its own bucket, because I don't really think that doesn't feel unless there's something we don't know it doesn't feel like it's really about the merits of the product. And it sounds like this issue was passed, but, but for sort of guessing again, this agency and how they'll behave. I mean, it's a topic that comes up in a lot of my investor discussions still.\n\n00:18:05,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah and I mean I'll just comment a little bit on this and again, it's I'm always a little skeptical with anonymous sources and kind of inferential data without the company and what they can formally communicate or what the FDA is formally communicating.","char_start":15491,"char_end":19078,"start_time":"00:15:18","end_time":null}

There was a decades-old management team. Many of them were not the right fit, and we needed to replace some of them. And when you're coming in new with a different kind of framework, the first thing you want to do as a leader, and I think most CEOs can relate to this, is that, 'All right, do I have people who are aligned with this vision And it's not going to be implemented tomorrow, but like over the years. Am I going to be? And you're going to see displacement. You're going to see people quit and leave and disgruntled. And I just, you know, I always think about what if the tables were turned? Let's say, four years from now, the new administration comes in. The same people that are booing and jeering against every action and every departure, they're going to be cheering and saying, 'This is amazing' and 'This is great' that we're getting rid of all of these people.\n\n00:19:21,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I think you know it's expected that a leader needs a team that he can rely on. And I also think about, like, the Calvista, maybe the Capricorn, like, um, I think he should delegate to the people he's put in place, like Vinay, et cetera, and not, you know, be visible as commissioner, right. To get involved in these, but you know, you have to believe he's going to get the criticism for any misstep for, I mean, the, the microscope is on, right. The spotlight's on. And so I'd imagine that he wants to be a little leaning in to almost every key decision because if he just kind of lets it just play out, then he's going to be the one as new commissioner that's going to get the criticism. So I would expect that some a little bit more intervention to just figure out. Now that it's on his watch, right, what is he gonna see? And then, the last thing is: there's been a longstanding, decades-long battle between the divisions and the higher hierarchy. The hierarchy policy doesn't always align with the divisions or specific divisions, and that's got to play out.\n\n00:20:27,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n We got to figure out what this looks like. And direct intervention is not common. But I think, in this period and stage, that the new administration, the political appointees, are trying to work out. How is the new administration gonna operate as an FDA? I would expect a little bit of this uncertainty. How's it gonna work out, division by division? That's my perspective on this and why I always feel like we should all you know if we could go to sleep for six months and or nine months and and wake up to see how things are operating. It's probably better.\n\n00:21:00,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, Chris, do you think it's believable that an FDA commissioner would actually, in effect, to order a CRL because that's better than the optics of a delay? I mean, it feels like that is.\n\n00:21:15,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Been what's inferred here without really saying, and again, I think, like, you know, kind of what you're alluding to, and I'm trying to think out loud about, is like, does that actually, does it actually like pass the smell test? But if it is true, I mean, that's certainly disconcerting. Like, how do you mix? sense of that.\n\n00:21:31,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't think it should be a unilateral kind of, you know, flying in, right. Helicoptering in and saying, 'This is what, this is what my guess is.' And this is just from personal experience. He's getting a lot of information, right. And we don't know who's bending his ear. And it could be that somebody's raising an alarm and they may be misguided, right? But I would expect that. If he's got an internal dispute.","char_start":18778,"char_end":22882,"start_time":"00:18:05","end_time":null}

If he's got an internal dispute.\n\n00:21:56,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n And people are, you know, and if they want to listen, it sounds like they want to hear everything and make the right decisions, that he's probably hearing countervailing views. That he's gotta consider. And he's hearing what, you know, division leader or the clinical reviewers to saying, uh, or the CMC right reviewer. And I think that he's trying to potentially. try to really get to the right decision. That's my guess. Now, if that is interpreted that, oh, he's ordering a CRL, which doesn't sound like it's going to play out that way, I would imagine it's based on he believes the group that thinks that it should get a CRL. I would be hard-pressed to believe that he's unilaterally looking at. the ind or the the nda and then realizing that oh yeah, I would definitely give this a CRL. He's he's listening to people internally and I can tell you just from my surreptitious experience internal debates. At the FDA are alive and well. Of course. You know and so I that's what that's my interpretation on it is you know who's he listening to who does who is he believing what does the data tell him in terms of uh who's true that that that's what I kind of read through you know in between the lines on what was communicated Yeah, makes sense.\n\n00:23:11,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. All right, let's move on to some data. We got a lot of news over the last couple of weeks. ADA was kind of the big medical meeting this week. Sam, do you want to kick off? We've talked a lot about diabetes and obesity, and this is a big conference. So why don't you kick us off?\n\n00:23:29,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sure. The first thing I'd like to say is whether we should be still calling it ABA rather than AOA, American Obesity Association. But of course, these two diseases are metabolic diseases and related. But let me just set the context here. There's this loggerhead between Lily and Novo. Novo, just as an illustration, Novo has gone from 230,000 prescriptions for Wegovy at the beginning of the year to 246,000, a 16,000 increase. Z-bounds have gone from 160,000 to 366,000. Sorry, total, right? So we're dealing with a 160,000 increase for Z-bounds and a 16,000 increase for Z-bounds. Uh, we go V and that band is now as I said, 366, 000 total versus 246 total. So we have this competition going on and Zetban and Lily are winning it. And I have to say that I think data that came out over the last weekend gives Lily the upper hand in terms of what we've seen.\n\n00:24:33,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I'm going to try and summarize as fast as I can here. Novo came out with some pagrysema data. And what were we looking for new in there? We knew already that the FPC was 22. 7%, whereas they had suggested 25% previously. That's already been covered. We've been through that. What was interesting in the detail is that for agrisema, the weight loss was not as favorable in terms of how much fat you're losing versus muscle.\n\n00:25:08,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n While it was even not as good as ZipBout.\n\n00:25:11,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n These are the details we were thinking about. If you remember, here we have an amylin. um analog and a GLP-1s semaglutide, so the idea has been that by adding enameline you might not only just manage some of the side effects better, but you might also push through weight loss towards more fat versus muscle. And that didn't turn out to be the case. In fact, it turned out to be worse than what we've seen for Z-Bound, but this wasn't a head-to-head. So this was the key data sets as far as we're concerned for Kegri-Sema. And now there is, of course, a head-to-head trial versus Z-bound redefined for, and that's due to read out sometime in 2026. sticking with NOVO and exactly the same mechanism, GLP-1 plus amylin, but in one molecule, as opposed to two molecules being delivered. for Kagisama. So that's amicretin, and that's moving directly into phase three, but we have questions on the dosing that still continue to be essentially unanswered as far as we're concerned.","char_start":22582,"char_end":26879,"start_time":"00:21:56","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770_chunk_0007","doc_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770","order":7,"text":"tly the same mechanism, GLP-1 plus amylin, but in one molecule, as opposed to two molecules being delivered. for Kagisama. So that's amicretin, and that's moving directly into phase three, but we have questions on the dosing that still continue to be essentially unanswered as far as we're concerned.\n\n00:26:15,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n 24% placebo-adjusted weight loss. So that wasn't bad. That's pretty good at 36 weeks, right? Remember, we're trying to touch that 25% boundary. At least that's what some-people have been focused on. And the response, 20 milligrams versus 60 milligrams, and overlapping curves at the lower doses. So some questions arose where the shorter durations were tested.\n\n00:26:41,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n The rates of gastrointestinal side effects from migrating were high. I mean, high. And they need to really be viewed in the context of a phase one, of course. But we hope that they can get the dosing. et cetera, in a place that they can manage that. There were a few other things: rate increases that were seen beyond what's been seen for Zipband and Wegovy. And so there's still questions on this combination too. And when I add all this up, and then we look at what Lilly reported, which was their first details of their Orforglipron, which is their oral drug. Which seemed manageable safety, good tolerability, decent efficacy, even some benefits on the cardiometabolic metrics. And I think you'd have to agree to give this conference to Lilly. There's no question that there's such a big market here, then. That NOVA can continue to have a significant share. And continue to be a big player and have growth there.\n\n00:27:44,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n But they do have something to deal with and that's in their competitive pipeline.\n\n00:27:49,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then, of course, we've had some other things. So Maritide from Amgen reported some details. The tolerability concerns continue to eclipse. The weight loss data. Remember, this is an antibody which tries to be an antagonist of the GIP receptor and an agonist of GLP-1, just like all other GLP-1 agonists. So this is slightly different to what Trisepatite from Lilly is doing, which is an agonist of both.\n\n00:28:19,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the data was, you know, compelling weight loss, but we've got that issue with safety and some questions about the way the trial was designed, KOL's question did, etc. There's more work to be done here. And then I'll move on to quickly to Metzera's GLP-1. Remember, Metzera's share price has been doing relatively well on the back of this. Well tolerated. It's called MET-097i. It's a GLP-1. In a face-to-face obesity trial, And it achieved weight loss that, in our eyes, rivals.\n\n00:28:52,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Lilly is retratratide, it's titration-free, and possibly monthly dosing could provide a differentiation, obviously. So we just have to wait and see whether they can repeat that. In Phase 2b, and we have the data for that coming over the next year or so. So the drug is a while away from the market, 2028.\n\n00:29:11,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n But it's got a fighting chance, especially given its policy regime. Of course, the next one is bimagnetide, but I think we're going to try and cover that with text.\n\n00:29:22,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. So, well, first, I like your comment about Novo. It's not out of the game at all, right? Even though Lily is prevailing. Across these products. And so, really, great tour de force there on. Lot of the data coming out of Ada and test— you want to to highlight Lily's uh by my group.\n\n00:29:38,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, absolutely. So, Bimigramab, so this is a myostatin activin drug that Lilly has been developing. They acquired it from Versana. And what this addresses— so there's you know— there's been questions with um You know, the GLP-1s were, hey, you lose a lot of weight. Isn't that great? You also lose a lot of muscle. And are there issues with losing a lot of muscle? Think that's an unanswered question. You know, I think, you know, many who are, you know, bullish on some of these muscle agents were, I think, hoping for the FDA to maybe be a little bit more, you know, positive about this as an unmet need and their obesity guidance that came out. But the FDA in their guidance was really saying that at this point in time, there isn't anything that indicates that it's an issue.","char_start":26579,"char_end":30914,"start_time":"00:26:15","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770_chunk_0008","doc_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770","order":8,"text":" muscle agents were, I think, hoping for the FDA to maybe be a little bit more, you know, positive about this as an unmet need and their obesity guidance that came out. But the FDA in their guidance was really saying that at this point in time, there isn't anything that indicates that it's an issue.\n\n00:30:30,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, you know, we don't know, right? And it may be that, particularly in certain patient populations, you know, who are taking GLP-1s, if you know, if it's a frail patient population or otherwise, you know, there may be greater concerns about muscle loss. So Bimigrumab is really looking to address some of those concerns. And it was, I think, pretty interesting data.\n\n00:31:01,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so what they presented is they presented both 48 and 74-week data on Bimigrumab, and they showed, at the highest dose, which was 30 mg per kg, they showed pretty high weight loss at 48 weeks.\n\n00:31:23,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Around, you know, I think 7% if you just looked at completers, or more like 5% if, you know, placebo-adjusted, if you looked at those, you know, if you looked at everything on an ITT basis. And that indeed strengthened over time as you got to the later time point. So in addition to that, what they showed is that, in combination, you really saw a much higher proportion of fat mass. So, you know, for the semaglutide, this was actually a trial that was semaglutide plus bimigrumab, since it was one that Versano started before Lilly acquired the asset. Lilly is now running these trials with triseptide. But in the Sema monotherapy arm, about 70% or so of the weight loss was due to fat mass. But then, when you got to the combo of Bimigrumab and Sema, it was over 90%.\n\n00:32:25,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n So that was pretty interesting. Now, what I think is important to note is on the safety and tolerability side of things. There were some side effects that looked not particularly pleasant. So there was a pretty high rate of muscle spasms. There was also pretty high acne. But when this was being discussed, you know, the discussants highlighted that these, you know, these AEs actually seemed, you know, fairly manageable. They didn't see a whole lot of discontinuity. As a result of this. And also, the way that Lily is studying this is, you know, rather than IV, which was this trial, the way that Lily is studying this in future, you know, trials and, sorry, ongoing trials with um, with the z bound is they're using subq. So, might there actually be uh, you know, a better AE profile if you have a lower Cmax as a result of uh, the sub you know, as a result of subq?\n\n00:33:28,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I think it was, bottom line, very interesting data that suggested that these agents certainly do have an impact on lean mass and that there is an additive effect of activin on top of myostatin that's actually consistent with uh, some of the data that we saw from uh, you know, Regeneron a couple months ago and just looking at the comparison.\n\n00:33:55,630 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, versus, you know, Scholar Rock as well, which came out with their myostatin data, you know, a few weeks ago. All of those are interesting, but we do see this incremental activity from Activen, which seems to be important here in getting to the incremental weight loss as well as lean mass preservation that these agents could provide. The big questions remain: what will the tolerability profile look like with this different dosing? And also, how much does this actually matter to patients?\n\n00:34:33,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Do they see any kind of functional benefit? That's something that we'll need to see over time with other studies, but certainly an interesting start.\n\n00:34:44,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thank you. Hey, Chris. Yeah, please. Let me just jump in very quickly. There was a couple of other things I wanted to add for this. One was just what I was a little bit surprised. That is that the cardiometabolic markers. improving for the combo versus semaglutide alone.\n\n00:35:02,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n So HSCRP, you know, the cardiac inflammation marker, 83% decrease in the combo arm versus 59% on Wegovy alone. Remember, there's Wegovy in the combo.\n\n00:35:13,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n That, to me, was quite an interesting one to observe and try to understand the mechanism and the connecting improvements, etc. So there's something else going on in there, which is not just fat loss.","char_start":30614,"char_end":35017,"start_time":"00:30:30","end_time":null}

I can't imagine any level of acne that would be acceptable to someone like this. So I think we can brush this side effect issue away and muscle spasms away. I don't know if it's going to be as easy as that when it comes to actual commercial. Use unless they manage it somehow.\n\n00:35:46,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I guess, Sam, it comes down to how do you trade off acne versus a leaner look? So, well, you know, it's. It's certainly a good point, but I think it's interesting and the kind of aesthetic aspects, you know, may play in a few different ways. So I was wishing that they had some before and after pictures that they could share as part of this presentation, but we didn't get to see those.\n\n00:36:13,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm sure there's some conjoint analysis that can be done of, is a thinner body with acne more attractive than a larger body without, right? Yeah. So, but what this all speaks to, to me and why there's so much activity in this space and continued investment and interest is that. You know, there's multiple efficacy parameters that a product can win on. You've got safety issues that a product can win on, regardless of mechanism. You've got, uh, you know, combinatorial approaches that are being attempted that could be flanked by a single product, even with multiple pluripotent actions. So, I think people are realizing this is too big of a market to not try to pursue a better. Or best in class around this with the various mechanisms. So it'll be interesting to see how this continues to evolve. Tess, do you want to cover on the hymns? Speaking of Novo has been a part of this conversation.\n\n00:37:08,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think continuing on that, continuing on the obesity theme. So, you know, some big announcements, some big announcements, you know, last week from Novo and HIMSS. Where Novo had—uh— you know— made a couple of different agreements actually with um uh— you know— with a few groups that can help with their uh— you know— with their uh direct-to-consume sales of Wegovy and HIMSS was one of those. And, you know, they'd signed this partnership just a few months ago, I think, you know, on the back of that announcement. I think that Hymnstock went up, you know, 30% on that day and, you know, kept going a bit from there. And then, just a few short months later, it went back down with Novo essentially saying that they, you know, we're no longer going to make Wigovia available on hymns. And they said that was a result of HIMSS selling illegitimate knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk. So not just ending the collaboration, but, you know, really coming out with some strong words on HIMSS.\n\n00:38:12,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n I know we have several other uh, you know, members of the group here who have thoughts on this. So Tim, maybe I will turn it over to you. And what was your reaction when you saw this, Tim?\n\n00:38:24,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, I thought it was weird that Novo and HIMSS did the collaboration in the first place. And the reason is that the business model of HIMSS, and for that matter, many other players in the market, is to sell compounded clip ones to consumers directly. And there's an obvious reason why that works. The price is lower and consumers care about price. And so.\n\n00:38:53,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, the original deal was sort of weird because you can go buy semaglutide directly from Novo from their direct website.\n\n00:39:01,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n And the hymns was literally just selling it. For a hundred dollars extra per month, and so it's just like a very odd deal in the first place, and I'm not at all surprised that Nova said, like, 'Why are we letting these guys benefit from an affiliation with us when they're essentially selling something that is more or less like a generic version of semaglutide in the market.\n\n00:39:25,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n So not surprising.

I mean, for what it's worth.'\n\n00:39:30,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, this direct-to-consumer movement with obesity drugs has just gotten very big, Tess, and I attended this Royalty Pharma conference and the CEO of Eli Lilly spoke and he said that, like, sales off of the Lilly direct website are much larger than one might, at least much larger than I would have expected.\n\n00:39:52,180 [SPEAKER_4]\n Just really interesting—I know it's controversial this area, uh, but you know, personally, I think it's frankly, probably good for consumers that they can access these drugs at a price that they could afford.\n\n00:40:07,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great. All right. Well, any other final comments on the obesity theme here and coming out of ADA, Sam Daphne, before we move on to some other data?\n\n00:40:16,260 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, I'll comment. I think that the direct-to-consumer aspect is really interesting and probably positive. And I don't have a problem with compounding per se or selling compounded GLP-1s, especially during a shortage. But I just find HIMSS to be so hypocritical. You know, they present themselves as champions of accessible science-backed healthcare. criticizing the industry for maximizing profit while profiting themselves. They're basically like a parasite feeding off of innovation.\n\n00:40:45,540 [SPEAKER_5]\n and development that Novo and Lily did. And then they're pushing. these unregulated compounded drugs and kind of circumventing IP protection through regulatory loopholes. And in particular, what was annoying was their advertisements. We're pushing really hard and slamming the industry, saying that the industry is designed to keep us sick and stuck and it offers one-size-fits-all solutions, it obscures the truth. And you know it has inflated prices and wants to keep us overweight and then they basically sell a metoo version of the same drugs developed by those companies so I just look—I think it's good. Novo cut ties with them and I just think they're a shady company overall.\n\n00:41:25,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. Yep. Tess, as you know well, Peter Kocinski likes to call them rent seekers as opposed to innovators in our industry. And that's a polite term.\n\n00:41:35,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, yes.\n\n00:41:37,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. So I want to move to some data and test before we go to the Sadara, I want to just highlight, you know, My last interview I announced on Biotech Venture Voices is Glenn Rockman, and he's one of the only VCs that actually still is focused exclusively on antivirals, vaccines, infectious disease, neglected disease around the world. uh so that that interview comes out on Monday but you know we mentioned Sadara and Lenna Capovir on HIV, uh you know in their data, uh you know to prevent HIV with two injections, but Sadara is over a billion dollar market cap and just shows that uh The universal flu vaccine still has a play here in the market. So you want to cover that one to kick us off on other data.\n\n00:42:22,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, absolutely, Chris. I think encouraging to see and an important reminder that we would still like drugs that help us from getting sick. Isn't that? But isn't that important? So Sedara is a company, I think, just highlighting what happened this week. So on the 23rd. Siddharth announced data showing that their flu prevention treatment reduced the risk of flu by as much as 76% at the highest dose in healthy, unvaccinated adults. And so the stock was, you know, was certainly up on this data. You know, the stock went from kind of low 20s to trading now in the mid to high 40s. And I think this is pretty unprecedented from an efficacy standpoint. And maybe just a little bit of background on Sedara, because this is one that, you know, Ari's been close to for a while. is Sadara had actually outlicensed this program to J &J many years ago.\n\n00:43:24,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um and uh, you know, we and some others have followed this asset at J &J and uh, you know, we actually had the opportunity to in-license, you know, the asset after J &J had deprioritized infectious disease. And so RA led the financing for Sedara to reacquire the drug back from J &J in April 2024. And my colleague, Laura Tedvelkar.","char_start":38726,"char_end":43187,"start_time":"00:39:25","end_time":null}

And my colleague, Laura Tedvelkar.\n\n00:43:50,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, led that transaction and was on the board, now transitioned over to my colleague, Josh. And, you know, really just exciting to see after this, you know, long, you know, kind of very biotech process of, you know, licensing and, you know, bringing things back. Um, you know, seeing data you know play out in a way that was um, you know, that was really encouraging. And maybe just highlighting a few reasons why we thought this asset was interesting in the first place was, you know, number one, the opportunity for universal protection, right, versus the kind of flu variants that, you know, that you see where a vaccine is really designed for some of those flu variants. Um, you know, two is uh, you know, the the the The drug was really designed for seeds and lawn protection. And then three is that you're not relying on an immune response with the mechanism that SIDARI uses. And so that's really cool because it's not just the potential to have efficacy on a standalone basis, but hey, something that could also be used potentially on top of a vaccine.\n\n00:45:02,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n So encouraging to see that even in a market environment where there is a lot of skepticism and many investors have, you know, really, as a result of the regulatory environment, are not doing a whole lot in the vaccine space. Hey, we still have flu. We still have infectious disease. And it's important to have medicines that can, you know, help people from acquiring these diseases.\n\n00:45:30,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep. And the market reacted, you know, with over 100% return. Congratulations to RA for that investment. And just a shout out, the CEO is a well-known executive in the infectious disease space, Jeff Stein. Brad Loncar posted a video of an interview with him from May on Biotech TV. Yeah, great to see an antiviral get that type of attention. Paul, let's move to Compass and the hallucinogenic or psychedelic space has been kind of hotly debated. Phase three data from Compass. You want to cover that?\n\n00:46:04,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, sounds good. Positive data that was not well received by the market.\n\n00:46:09,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n And a debate going forward as you're alluding to. So, compass announced phase three data from their first trial of comp 360 uh psilocybin for their two for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression. This was a placebo-controlled study, and to some degree, it was widely expected to succeed for a few reasons. One, you know, I think point we we kind of know that psychedelics are efficacious and two, while depression studies are high risk, right? And we've seen drugs like prozac fail in half their trials. I mean, the psychedelic data has been somewhat more consistent so far. And there's this kind of debate as to what degree is that due to the drug class, or is that due to psychedelics? Some tailwind from, from functional on blinding. You know, the stock traded off a lot. I think something like 40%. And, you know, the question is why and how much of that is the data. And how much of that is actually the sort of small microcap biotech market in certain nuances, you know. I think on the data, the interesting debate here was that the effect size was just not as big as people expected.","char_start":42887,"char_end":46448,"start_time":"00:43:50","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770_chunk_0012","doc_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770","order":12,"text":"ng like 40%. And, you know, the question is why and how much of that is the data. And how much of that is actually the sort of small microcap biotech market in certain nuances, you know. I think on the data, the interesting debate here was that the effect size was just not as big as people expected.\n\n00:47:10,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n It was a 3. 6 point difference on the Madras. You know, we've seen other psychedelic trials like Compass's prior trial or, you know, the G8 study or mind med in an anxiety population with comorbid depression. You know, show bigger bigger effect sizes in this, in some cases, much bigger. You know, I think our view is that it's really hard to compare across these studies because of the time point differences. Compass was six weeks. I mean, the GH data looks incredible with their effect size, but that was only at one week. MyMed different population, it's not driven resistant depression and and I guess our other sort of perspective here is if you just take a thousand-foot view, you know, while psychedelics are certainly a new class and maybe more cumbersome to you, so you could argue the clinical bar is higher. The converse to that is at least in the psychiatry space, I've long been of the view that investors grossly overrate efficacy and effect sizes on these scales that are really subjective and at the end of the day just don't seem to be driving prescribing decisions. And, you know, I guess case in point, if you're an optimistic on the compass data or some of these next-gen psychedelics, which I am, you know, Spravato from J &J is probably going to sell around one and a half billion dollars this year.\n\n00:48:19,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Heartfelt than half its studies, and its average effect size is less than what we've seen from Compass's average effect size. So I still feel like this is a real space. And again, I feel like investors often treat psychiatry like it's oncology. You know, these scales are hand-wavy. There's so many reasons why one trial might look one way versus another. Another. And, you know, I would say that, you know, the KOLs are often not really in the weeds and what the effect size is for a given drug or how many failed trials that drug might even have that aren't published or on the drugs label. I think the other sort of practical issue here, and, you know, I'd be curious to hear anyone else's view, like, you know, tests or Tim or Daphne. But just as it relates to stock setups and sentiment in the market, I think one thing that was challenging for Compass on these data, and we'll never be able to run a controlled study and see how it would have traded if the data showed a bigger effect. But I think one thing that was challenging there is a little bit of a sell the news dynamic with some of these little companies that head into a catalyst vacuum. The next phase three doesn't read out until second half of next year.\n\n00:49:21,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n Right or wrong, there's a perception that these psychedelics companies are lower probability m a targets because they're just so unique. Right and you know, a conservative pharma might not be as inclined to buy um a psychedelic like they might be inclined to buy Karuna. Right and I don't know if that's true, but that's the perception I mean. It's probably true in some cases, and so I think that's like part of this. And it's a little bit of a caution cautionary tale of, are we in a good market? Are we not in a good market? I mean, I feel like there is more risk on in small-cap biotech right now, but I also think you have to be conscientious when you're thinking about how stocks trade in these events on the exact setup. What comes after it? Does the next investor feel like they have to own the stock after the data? Timelines, things like that. Again, ultimately, our perspective is you really can't. You have to have investment ratings that are based on fundamentals, not based on these kind of month by month stock set up things, but the market's the market. And this is kind of how this played out.","char_start":46148,"char_end":50187,"start_time":"00:47:10","end_time":null}

And this is kind of how this played out.\n\n00:50:21,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yep, uh, I'll just also add that you know, obviously, RFK Jr. has been vocal about this being an area that he wants to see kind of more attention and focus, and I believe the Deputy Cedar Director has kind of lineage in the psychedelic space and is perceived as a positive. So I do think and Daphne knows as well in the CNS space in the neuropsych area. It's still the bastion of personalized, like where you're looking across at that patient and, like, if something's not working, they're going to try something else. But if, you know, it's an armamentarium-driven approach. Kind of, uh, you know, disease space, um, so it'll be interesting to watch that, but we've got a lot of data to cover still, so we'll try to rapid fire through this, uh, Tim Nectar's been the roller coaster company, ups and downs over uh the years, uh, what's the latest that they're back in the news?\n\n00:51:14,030 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yep, so Nectar had a data readout this week on a program that was returned from Eli Lilly. The program, ResPeg, had a huge Phase 2B win this week in atopic dermatitis. The drug works kind of sort of uniquely through an IL-2 Treg stimulation mechanism. And boy, did they make their point, which is Tregs really matter in this particular disease. The effect size was very substantial and I think all of us sort of looking at this situation think that Dupixent may have a new competitor. Now, Dupixent's doing over $10 billion a year. And, you know, by the end of the week, you know, Nectar stock was up like 200%.\n\n00:51:54,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n Like you wonder if maybe the company's worth even more still.\n\n00:52:00,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Excellent.\n\n00:52:01,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n So. the other news that came out in the last two weeks uh was out of Serepta and a second death and They really saw their stock drop precipitously. And just to put this in perspective, a year ago in June, they hit, which was their almost five-year high, they hit over $170 in 2020, but they almost hit $170 a year ago in June of 2024.\n\n00:52:28,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n And today they're trading in the $17. 40 range.\n\n00:52:34,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n So again, this is a company that's expected to do over $2 billion in this year. The FDA has said they're going to look closely at this. There's been a stopping of shipments to the non-ambulatory population because both deaths occurred in the non-ambulatory. And so people were worried another shoe would drop. And so I think Sarepta is being uh closely paid attention to, and then they still have over a billion dollars in the oligonucleotide business, which doesn't have the safety risks, but there is a lot of competition. Uh, coming out avidity dying you know others that are gunning for better, you know kind of oligo sequence targeting for RNA technologies. Um, so with that, any comments, Sam, on this? Elevitis gene therapy from Sarepta. What's your take on it?\n\n00:53:28,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, first, of course, the second tragedy, and, you know, you wish you, hope that you never, ever see this happen with any drug. So and it's been prescribed to the non-ambulatory group, which is just, I'll make the connection to the FDA. So this is the indication that Peter Marks did a lot of good things at the FDA, but this is one that he perhaps might be remembered for in the end.\n\n00:53:54,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I'll just add, Vinay was very vocal via his podcast of that particular decision.\n\n00:53:59,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah yeah, so he overruled the reviewers and um and pushed it for all patients, which includes um uh these non-ambulatory group uh so and that that that that is what I think is the one thing that everyone's going to remember here and point to and like we're doing right so. So I just wonder whether this will at all impact the newfound regulatory flexibility that they are talking about with regards to cell and gene therapies. Or at least the hyper-orphan diseases, ultra-orphan diseases? I hope not, because this is partly the agency's fault themselves.\n\n00:54:40,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Over.","char_start":49887,"char_end":54233,"start_time":"00:50:21","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770_chunk_0014","doc_id":"doc_2c1539ac5770","order":14,"text":"er whether this will at all impact the newfound regulatory flexibility that they are talking about with regards to cell and gene therapies.

And look, and related to DMD and-uh you know controversial data sets if you will uh arguments on both sides for capricor where it seems like the FDA wants to take a closer look, but uh canceled an adcom right so it's I think there's mixed feelings on whether this is a positive move. versus a negative. The company put out a press release stating that they just released even more data, stronger data supporting a potential approval. Uh, so again, you can kind of draw a line through the DMD uh experiences of you know controversial data sets uh and how the FD is interpreting it. But any further comments on kind of the Capricorn, Paul, since I know you've spoken about this in the past.\n\n00:55:28,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, well, I mean, I was just kind of mentioning with the earlier stuff with Macri and Cal Vista and, you know, whatever that. You know, the reporting here was that, you know, Capricorn. But the adcom may have been canceled because Dr. Prasad has reservations about that therapy and doesn't want an adcom. And that might have been part of how Nicole Verdun may have been let go. Also, there are other potential reasons that were talked about by Stat News on how she and why she may have been let go, related to Stiles. And I actually think, you know, I mean, the Nicole Verdun departure is. At face unfortunate for the gene therapy space. I've heard from a number of companies in this area that saw her as a really good regulator and partner. On the other hand, Chris like you were saying, right when you have new leadership in an organization like things like this are going to happen, and they're not shocking like I think of companies of mine, right where a CEO or CFO has changed. I mean, you often see, if the company's not acquired in the next year, you often see half the C-suite also turnover, right? As people bring in their own people or people they have better chemistry with. You know, I think, as it relates to Capricor, like, this is one of the decisions that investors are looking to as a barometer of FDA flexibility, right?\n\n00:56:35,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, we've heard Prasad and Macri say- quote-unquote all the right things in rare disease and talk about you know approving something on mechanism or small studies or things like that and so this Capricor product right it's something that has has natural history controlled data over time. That's the crux of the efficacy argument.\n\n00:56:56,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think the cancellation of the adcom is probably because of the reporting and because of some of the context seen is probably more negative. um i don't cover the stock but i just it's something we're watching as we think about other sort of regulatory stuff in gene therapy like unicure and this isn't gene therapy but in the space like unicure for example Great.\n\n00:57:14,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right. We're approaching the hour. I'm going to ask for some. So first, there have been a lot of activities with the ACIP, you know, removal and adding. Uh, in the first meeting, uh, where they basically uh, announced they want to take their Marisol out of the flu vaccine new cedar head. We don't have time to cover all of that. Sam, I know you would want to comment on that. We got two more items. I want to cover Sam on Illumina SomaLogic. Uh and then Tim, we're gonna go to you on the Bear. Blue Rock News. Uh before we wrap, Sam, quick on Illumina.\n\n00:57:46,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, what's interesting here is that this company was acquired for about $50 million about a year ago. So Thermo Logic was a public company. And then now, of course, Illumina is buying them. So this is just testament to the increasing importance of multiomics, if you like. So the demand for that application is on the rise. Illumina is paying $350 million. I'm doing it really fast, so I hope I don't get the numbers wrong.\n\n00:58:13,029 [SPEAKER_2]\n And there's a handful of smaller deals that have happened here. And these guys had a partnership before. So it's testament to the importance and breadth of what these companies are offering now for research. Soon moving into the more mainstream.","char_start":53933,"char_end":58393,"start_time":"00:54:40","end_time":null}

Soon moving into the more mainstream.\n\n00:58:30,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah and Illumina, I mean, you know, to their credit, you know, protecting their business and realizing that the The needs and technologies are moving fast, and they need to be, you know, ahead of the curve on this. Tim, Bear Blue Rock. This is one of those where I see it as a cautionary tale when you think.\n\n00:58:47,509 [SPEAKER_3]\n Your programs are going to move forward with a large pharma, but bears had issues. You want to comment on what's going on there?\n\n00:58:57,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tim, if you heard that bear in Blue Rock.\n\n00:59:01,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sorry, I was saying Bayer bought Blue Rock a couple of years ago with a focus on treating Parkinson's with a very innovative cell therapy program. Bayer shut down the Blue Rock R&D lab last week with the effect of essentially letting go about 50 people. To be clear, they didn't stop the phase three trial of their Parkinson's drug. What's exciting and I think very interesting is that there's a number of other players in this space, companies like Kenai, that look really good. And you know, we are seeing lots of talk of significantly better data coming out of some of the other companies and Parkinson's, so this is going to be a big space to watch—I think over the next year or so as we start to see the data sets emerge from some of these challengers to Blue Rock, which is the first generation Parkinson's Cell Therapy Company.\n\n00:59:53,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, and just want to shout out lastly that Revolution Medicines and Royalty Pharma, I think, may be timed with Royalty Pharma's meeting to announce this $2 billion deal, creative structure, part royalty, part debt deal for their RAS inhibitor pipeline.\n\n01:00:10,459 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tester, Sam, any comments on that? Tess, I think you were at the conference. I don't know if they talked a lot about that to wrap the final news of the week.\n\n01:00:19,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think absolutely. Very positive note on which to wrap up.\n\n01:00:24,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, wrap things up so Royalty Pharma announced a um A $2 billion investment in Revolution Medicines that was really a deal. Obviously, Royalty Pharma is not an equity investor, but they're really taking a bet on. Uh, you know, revolution medicine is having a leading drug and leading franchise.\n\n01:00:45,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, and I had an opportunity at the conference that Tim and I both attended to speak with the CFO. And, you know, he shared their thesis on really wanting to support biotech companies and staying independent.\n\n01:01:01,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n And staying independent and being able to create value longer, which is obviously. It's fantastic to have more groups that are really focused on doing that and enabling that. I thought what was also, you know, really encouraging was just, you know, I think the you know, the stock reaction, you know, was.\n\n01:01:25,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n was fairly neutral, I want to say, to the deal, just looking that up now. But that's always encouraging that. You know, you don't have this, you know, oh, everyone's just kind of sitting around hoping for a buyout. Right. So, you know, kudos to the RevMed team for. you know, working with Royalty Pharma for what sounds like a really impactful deal.\n\n01:01:51,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Excellent. Daphne, just to go to you for any final comments before we wrap.\n\n01:01:56,240 [SPEAKER_5]\n I think that generally the thing that seemed to be the most concerning is the fact the lack of capital for a lot of companies. One note on the Royalty Pharma conference, which I thought was pretty interesting since we're talking a lot about Lilly. Was Dave Ricks, Lilly's CEO, mentioned that they're looking to get back into neuropsych? They had some big mega blockbusters with Prozac, Cymbalta, and Zyprexa. And they said they're waiting for the right opportunity to get back in. And then one last note is that Rajiv called.

We've been away for a couple weeks and a lot has happened. I think we're going to start off with some of the M &A news in the space. Always welcome to see DealFlow on the tape. We had this week, of course, the Merc Verona deal. That was a $10 billion transaction. It actually is the second largest transaction of the year. And then, while we were away on holiday, AbbVie brought a private company capstan for $2 billion. And, as Daphne Zohar noted to us, this is actually the third takeout in six months. Of a company led by a female CEO. That follows intracellular medicines.\n\n00:01:03,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Congrats to Lawyer Scheuer and the entire biotech sisterhood. Very well done, ladies. Um, Taking a Bit of a step upward and looking at where we are— almost a little more than six months now— into the year. By our math, there are now, in terms of M&A deals, as many takeouts thus far in 2025, 18 in total. As we pretty much had in all of 2024, 20 total, and the value of those transactions in 2025 is already eclipsing. The total value of deal flow in 2024.\n\n00:01:42,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n About $30 billion worth of deals done in 2024, versus over $40 billion now, year to date. And we also have three large deals, three deals of $5 billion plus, versus zero in 2025.\n\n00:01:58,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think by most metrics, this year is shaping up to be a very good year for biotech M&A again. Welcome news anytime you see a transaction.\n\n00:02:08,479 [SPEAKER_3]\n But let's open it up to the team here to discuss whether there's actually something going on that's a little bit more than just by rote chance.\n\n00:02:18,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Is this a biotech wave? And is there even such a thing as a biotech wave? Who'd like to start on that?\n\n00:02:24,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right.\n\n00:02:25,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I'll jump in.\n\n00:02:27,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think of the deals that you named, to me, the most interesting one is the Capstan deal because, like, you know, Verona was priced for a buyout. It's a commercial stage product that's having an awesome launch. And pharma companies have future revenue gaps to fill. So that's kind of expected. ITCI is another great example of that awesome commercial product that's doing well. Blueprint, another case of that.\n\n00:03:02,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n What's been missing in action for a long time is companies buying science, so to speak.\n\n00:03:11,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n That's what especially like people who invest in like XDI type stocks hope to start seeing because that's the vast majority of biotech companies out there.\n\n00:03:24,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um. You know the capstan deal that's an in vivo car t company and they just entered the clinic like in January, it's you know it's practically a pre-clinical company.\n\n00:03:36,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n And we also saw Lily by Verve about a month ago. And so I think it's a positive sign that you're starting to see. Pharma companies start to do those types of deals again, where they're they're buying science for the long term. And so, I think if we start seeing more of that, those are the types. Like, Verona is not going to lift like the XBI and and make us feel like biotech is back, so to speak. But, you know, when you see companies start buying, like, a gene editing company, well, there's dozens of other gene editing companies out there that might benefit from it. So, to me, those are that's a. a really positive sign that we're starting to see that.\n\n00:04:22,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tim, what's your take?","char_start":0,"char_end":3932,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

So, I've said on a few previous episodes that there's a lot of blatant M &A demand. And what's happened is the Trump tariff moves and also the MFN conversations have just created tremendous uncertainty. And now that that uncertainty has cleared, you know, to some degree, I think pharma is sort of back in business. They were planning on being in business all year, and they're going to be in business for the rest of the year. We're headed for what I would describe as a normal. In a year. There was a really nice article this week in the Financial Times on patent cliffs, and that article just made it clear. How severe the upcoming patent cliffs are. So pharma has no choice. I mean, they've got to go out and do inorganic expansion. And so what we're seeing is, you know, I would describe almost workmanlike steps by AbbVie.\n\n00:05:19,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n Merck and so on to do what they need to do to prepare their companies for the future.\n\n00:05:26,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n Test your thoughts on where we're going with M &A.\n\n00:05:29,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n Absolutely.\n\n00:05:30,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think it's really positive to see. I'm kind of with Brad just about, you know, very positive to see. That companies are not just looking to fill near-term patent cliffs, but also really thinking about 2030 plus, right? And what are the technologies? and sources of differentiation that are really going to matter, like 20, 30 plus. I think that, you know.\n\n00:05:55,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Verve and Capstan are both great examples of that.\n\n00:06:00,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n Brad, I want to come back to you and Eric. So you've heard what Tess and I have said, sort of how the— you know, M &A is normal and we're all starting to go a little bit early. Do you see any changes, kind of coming up in M &A patterns? Is there something that we're looking for that we haven't seen yet?\n\n00:06:25,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I don't know what to say to that. I'll pass that one to Eric.\n\n00:06:31,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Eric? Oh, that's very kind of both of you.\n\n00:06:35,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, look, I think Brad's right. It would be wonderful to see M &A just for the sake of science. I'm not sure we're going to get there, to be honest.\n\n00:06:45,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n That only happens in a very typically in a very frothy environment and and typically when There's scientific disruption ongoing that seemingly challenges the. The normal state of drug development and distribution. But at least I don't know of any science that folks are going to feel like they need to acquire, though Brad's point about VIRB and maybe in vivo cell therapy from Capstan are well taken. I'm just not sure that they're going to be anything more than one-offs. Um, but Tim, I wanted to come back to you on this LOE thing, because we have all read some of the same articles, though I missed the Financial Times one that you cited. I've seen statistics that suggest there's something like 150 billion dollars in LOE approaching. You noted that they don't have any choice. I mean, what choices do they really have? And walk us through how you think. The pharmaceutical management team considers potential capital reallocation strategies.\n\n00:07:48,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, Eric, maybe I'm cynical. I've been a banker for 30 plus years at this point. And so you just watch organizational behavior year in, year out. And you would like to think that most organizations are focused on maximizing shareholder value. And certainly there's that element of that. But. Every organization at the board level, the CEO level, and throughout the management has one overriding goal. and that is to survive, right to live for another day, you don't want to be the CEO that was the last CEO that Bristol Myers ever had or something like that. And so, Companies do what they need to do to survive, and survival means keeping your revenue in place. And that means M&A or some type of organic growth, but most companies in our industry don't have enough. of growth to get there.","char_start":3634,"char_end":8003,"start_time":"00:04:22","end_time":null}

I mean, the premiums for Blueprint and Verona, they were good, but they were not. They were not astounding, right? Um, So, you know, just Curious. I mean, we'll obviously get more, you know, I think, you know, we saw in the 14D9 with you know, between Blueprint and Santa Fe, it looked like they were. you know, they were the only bidder, you know, well, obviously. get more, you know, get more information. as we get some of the documents out for Verona. You know, I thought that was I thought that was I thought that was interesting and like noteworthy. And it does make me.\n\n00:09:29,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, it made me wonder a little bit what that means in terms of just the competition for some of these commercial stage assets.\n\n00:09:42,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's a great point, Tess. And you could throw in, maybe, the Springworks acquisition into that trend also, a little bit smaller, but not much of a premium. But I think, if you go a little bit smaller cap, we have seen some very significant premiums paid for the likes of Regulus or a Chimerix earlier in the year. Um, Yeah, I guess what we're probably seeing is the market being a little bit maybe more efficient. I mean, Verona certainly is a company that is already up multifold in the last 12 months. And the marketplace was pretty good at sniffing out the fact that game drug was selling quite well and likely to be quite substantial. Maybe the same could be said for Blueprint where the company helped us. Putting out some very aspirational long-term guidance that you know would be hard—I think— to come on top of and pay much of a premium for.\n\n00:10:33,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n We've all read the documents on Spring Works, so we kind of know how that's played out as well, but. Good point. I mean, I do think Brad's view that. The XBI would really get a jump if we started seeing. more. meaningful premiums paid for development stage companies is a good one. Brad, you wanted to add on?\n\n00:10:51,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I was just gonna say, like, congratulations to Capstan and like, no offense to them. I was shocked at the the buyout price 2. 1 billion not to say anything about the quality of their science or anything, but just the valuation again of a very recently clinical company—uh, that's being bought for science, like if that was a publicly traded stock right now. I just don't, you know, I.\n\n00:11:22,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n I just can't believe that it would be like a multi-billion dollar situation in the public markets. And I think that says a lot about how challenging the public markets are. Are right now. So to me that deal—um, just was a fantastic sign of— Um, big pharma willing to pay a lot for very early stage science. So I'd love to see a lot more of that. And my guess is the fact that it was a private company. I don't know what its private valuation is. I think Tess would know a lot more about that than I do.\n\n00:12:03,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n That number blew me away when I saw it. That would not be the case if it was a public company, for sure.\n\n00:12:12,860 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think I said, 'I'm biotech hanging up maybe four to six weeks ago.' I don't remember exactly when. That. I'm a practicing investment banker, and I'm working on more.\n\n00:12:25,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n M&A right now than I ever have.\n\n00:12:29,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Since that time, the amount of M&A I'm working on has gone up. Um, It's all commercial. So buyers are shopping commercial now. And there's a very simple reason, which is, you know, you need revenue, right? and um You can buy revenue. There's so many commercial stage companies that got their drug approved that didn't get taken out when they're in phase two or phase three. And so it's a buyer's market.\n\n00:12:57,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Almost universally.","char_start":7703,"char_end":11893,"start_time":"00:08:39","end_time":null}

So that you know the median number of bidders is one; it's not like six. And that's why the premiums are low and the reason we're in this market is that you know, the population of targets has just grown so much over the last three or four years. There's so many commercial stage companies. There's so many biotech companies available. And that reflects the capital that's been pouring into our sector over the last decade. And so it's a very interesting moment for M&A, I'd say.\n\n00:13:35,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n Those are great insights.\n\n00:13:37,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n I just lastly want to say one last thing about the Verona deal. So Verona.\n\n00:13:41,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n is a UK company and, you know, is founded there. And it's kind of become a US company. It's NASDAQ listed. And, you know, a lot of people and all that are here.\n\n00:13:53,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n But one thing that I think is interesting about it is it's both a mega success for UK life sciences, like ecosystem.\n\n00:14:04,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n But it's also like the age old thing there is like. Right when a company succeeds and hits the big time like they've been doing, it gets bought up and acquired.\n\n00:14:16,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, and then you're like back to square one again and so it'll be interesting to see, like, how the UK biotech ecosystem both benefits from this, but also if it's able to bounce back and have more Verona's and more that are kind of lasting, that stay there is like cornerstone companies that, you know, help the whole ecosystem.\n\n00:14:45,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Know great, great point. Sad for the UK environment for sure. Uh, I want to come back to Tim's comment and insights here as a banker. I mean, this median of one potential buyer per transaction.\n\n00:14:59,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n And how that might influence a more modest premium. Being paid here. Of course, the seller doesn't have to sell and boards and management teams can choose not to sell for. More modest 20 or 30% premium, are we seeing any entrenchment on their part? I mean, this has been a market that's been very favorable for companies launching products, and I wouldn't think there'd be. Know, strong need to sell if the premium weren't more substantial.\n\n00:15:29,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, most companies get very few offers. So, you know, we advise, as you can imagine, a whole roster of companies. And, you know, you sit down when you get a new client and say, 'So, like, how many times have you been approached in the last decade? The answer often is never or maybe once or twice. And so.'\n\n00:15:49,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, boards learn that when you get approached, you need to pay attention unless your long-term intention is to, you know, just keep running this company independently.\n\n00:15:58,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n The reality is that most commercial stage pharmaceutical companies don't have enough products. So when you look at the P &Ls of these companies, you don't see so many like a blueprint where the company just is going to go into EBITDA positive territory forever. And so that's really the driver of these acquisitions is. Typically, a company is better off in the hands of a larger organization that can amortize overhead expenses over more than one product.\n\n00:16:30,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n Very fair point. Thanks for that discussion, guys. Maybe we'll change gears here and talk about some of the macro stuff that's come out of Washington when we last sat down for Biotech Hangout. I think there was a lot of uncertainty about whether Trump's big, beautiful bill would even make it through.\n\n00:16:50,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n Last week, of course, things picked up a lot of steam and that bill was signed. The July 4th holiday. We also had some headlines this week about the emergence of Trump's thinking on tariffs.\n\n00:17:03,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe I'm hoping that Brad could introduce the first topic of the big beautiful bill, which is now law. And Tess might chat with us a little bit about the latest on the tariff front.","char_start":11593,"char_end":16007,"start_time":"00:12:57","end_time":null}

And Tess might chat with us a little bit about the latest on the tariff front.\n\n00:17:15,829 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, on the bill, there were a few things that were relevant to our industry but, to me, there was only there was one that was like really stood out and that's how Rare disease and orphan drugs are handled through the drug price negotiations from the IRA. Basically, if you had a rare disease drug, if it was only approved for one indication.\n\n00:17:41,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n Before this bill, it was exempt from having to go to drug price negotiations. And as everyone in our industry knows, that, depending on- on what the mechanism, you might eventually succeed in multiple rare disease indications.\n\n00:18:02,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Rectified that, so now if you have multiple approved indications for, like, a rare disease type patient population, you're now exempt. Which of course is the right thing to do. So, so that cleaned that up a little bit, and then you know, the other things like there's, you know, some Medicaid spending reductions and some some things about how, like, certain types of hospitals that uh you know service, uh, lower income communities and patients, uh, may affect our industry. But I, I think, for like drug developers, the biggest thing to know about is that rare disease exemption.\n\n00:18:50,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you and test you want to handle the tariffs.\n\n00:18:53,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, absolutely. And maybe I'll just make one point on the rare disease exemption. I mean, I think— you know, certainly positive to know that, you know, our representatives were aware that that was. The construction of the IRA was creating a disincentive for orphan drug development, especially small molecule orphan drug development for multi-orphan indications.\n\n00:19:20,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think, of course, the, you know, a more impactful A more impactful fix would have been, you know, to really just remove the small molecule penalty and have that be 13 years. You know, I think that my view, at least, is that would have. You know, certainly have more of an impact on drug development and kind of remove some of these, you know, R&D distortions. Yeah, we need drugs that are for multi-orphan conditions. We also want drugs for, you know, more drugs for Alzheimer's and, you know, cardiovascular conditions— heart failure and other things that affect you know, an elderly patient population that may not benefit from this broad exemption. So it's a good step and a good indication that there's awareness of this issue. You know, in my view, it's certainly better than nothing, but not quite the. Not quite what I would have hoped for in terms of a more permanent fix to what I see as the major challenge with the IRA.\n\n00:20:32,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n Do you think this makes it more difficult to neutralize the pill penalty in the future, or is that just something that this administration wants to kick back to the latter part of the year and hopefully trade for some other for some other concession from the industry, of course, thinking drug pricing?\n\n00:20:49,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, we'll see, right? I mean, it was clear in the executive order that came out on drug pricing that there's awareness of the distortions of the pill puddle tea, right?\n\n00:21:02,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think that's positive that it didn't happen in this, you know, in this bill is, you know, a bit unfortunate. But yeah, we'll see. I don't know if it necessarily. I mean, it removes one tool, I guess, that was a bill that is moving for actually getting things done.\n\n00:21:22,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, maybe it decreases the probability somewhat. But I don't think that it necessarily changes it drastically over time. And part of the reason for that is it does give— it does show like an acknowledgement of some of these distortions. So we'll see if it can come up at a later point.\n\n00:21:49,280 [SPEAKER_3]\n OK, maybe continue on with tariffs.\n\n00:21:51,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure. Yes. So. cabinet meeting last week.

Where you know, Trump brought up tariffs, talked about pharma tariffs, you know, potentially going up to 200 percent.\n\n00:22:08,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, we're going to give people about a year, a year and a half to come in. After that, they're going to be tariffed if they have to bring the pharmaceuticals into the country. The drugs and other things into the country. So very, you know, lots of.\n\n00:22:25,419 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, lots of words in that statement. But I think the general idea was okay. Pharma is going to get a tariff if they don't bring manufacturing into the U. S. We've heard a lot of announcements of companies that had the intention of bringing manufacturing into the U. S. One to 1. 5 years is like, that is not enough time to like do tech transfer and move a lot of these processes over to the US. So.\n\n00:22:51,969 [SPEAKER_1]\n you know, we'll see what actually, you know, comes out of this. There was absolutely no like market move. I mean, there was a market move for like a very, very short period. of time that almost instantaneously corrected after the statement. And so my interpretation of that is more the belief that. hey, it's unlikely that something really serious happens. Um, more than, oh. you know, any tariff thing that does come in is like already priced in. I'd be I'd be interested in other perspectives of that. But that was, that was very much my view. Was that the absence of stock moves was more a reflection of, you know, the belief that, like, any ultimate policy was unlikely to be harmful than the belief that, uh, you know, such a policy, if it happened, were, uh, you know, would be fine and is, is kind of already priced in, but would love other perspectives on that.\n\n00:23:54,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I was also surprised by the market kind of shrugging off, not just the tariff headlines, but to some extent, the spending bill details too, which did have potential, as Brad noted, to negatively influence the biopharmaceutical industry in terms of a lesser coverage in Medicaid for, first. For healthcare, let alone for pharmaceuticals.\n\n00:24:17,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n But that was a bit of a head scratcher, right?\n\n00:24:20,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n That the markets have been so strong this week. I think, while we're giving back a little bit of the strength, this morning we were up nearly 4% through the first four days of the week.\n\n00:24:31,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n We've recovered fully from those April lows and seem almost like we're breaking out maybe. Maybe all of us who operate in the public markets have been beaten over the head so many times that we just expect that the knee-jerk reaction, again, to anything coming out of Washington is negative. But perhaps we're just, you know, that. Maybe growing a little bit numb to the headlines.\n\n00:24:56,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n And Trump is potentially, I don't know, losing his ability to influence the investment world.\n\n00:25:03,120 [SPEAKER_3]\n Hope that's the case. I think we need to naturally mature and navigate to a position where people care a little bit less about everything our new administration says and our new president says, but I'm not sure we're there yet. Tim, what do you think is going on?\n\n00:25:20,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll make a few comments, Eric. I think in terms of the overall sort of upswing or downswing of the market, it is driven very much by fundamentals. Those fundamentals are M &A, right? So we're seeing a lot of M &A lately. And I think the thesis that this might not be a great M &A year has sort of been disproven at this point. And so that's, I think, influential probably to a lot of funds that are on the sidelines that have discretion about where they put their money. But. Specifically, this week, I think there's been a lot more short-term trading that's been impacting our market, and rumors began to circulate. In the market the day before yesterday, that there were changes coming into the MFN rules. I believe that those rumors are true, but I don't know. I mean, I'm not a Washington insider at all. And so the story that was going around was that the approach to resolving MFN is going to mainly take place through the Medicaid system.","char_start":19780,"char_end":24143,"start_time":"00:21:49","end_time":null}

So that's very good news. For industry and you know, I don't know how this information you know, gets leaked out of Washington to some fund.\n\n00:26:39,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n As as that information got spread around the various funds that play in the market, you could just see the XBI just kind of popping up hour by hour. And then today, you know, there has not been an announcement on any changes in MFN, but we did see this FDA announcement. This morning, where FDA kind of came out and said, 'Hey, by the way, if you make your drug more affordable.' We may consider granting you a voucher to speed up your approval, which to me was certainly surprising. And uh, I think you know some people are like— so is that it? Is that what this MFN thing was? And I think the answer is no. I think there's something else coming, probably going to hit next week.\n\n00:27:22,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n I would just add, to put all of this in context, like, I hate to say this, but strong for us, let's face it, is like a poor man's strong. I mean, like the Nasdaq and the S&P are at all-time highs, like multi— you know, all-time ever highs. And um, the reason we're so excited is because our industry, like four months ago, was literally priced for Armageddon. Like we were going away, and like. There would be no drug sector, and we're at least like— I think some of the excitement is we're starting to feel like some things are normalizing, like M&A is normalizing, certain drug launches are doing well, even in the context of everyone bashing us on pricing and all of this stuff.\n\n00:28:12,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n All were really hoping to go through right now, and it seems like there's green shoots— is that we're, we're being priced from like pure like armageddon and destruction to something that looks a little more normal, so that at least segments of our industry can invest and run normal businesses.\n\n00:28:33,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, that's great perspective, Brad. And maybe, you know, before we get too optimistic about the green shoots that you referred to, there are there macro or other concerns that folks have that we still need to get past before we can feel truly the ability to breathe easier about biotech's future. Anything you guys are worried about?\n\n00:28:55,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think Tess said it, I can't remember, but one thing that's important about the tariff issue is that there will be a report that's finished at the end of this month.\n\n00:29:06,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n And so there should be good clarity on whether it's positive or negative.\n\n00:29:12,989 [SPEAKER_0]\n The guessing game should get a lot clearer. I don't know if it's going to be released on the last day of the month or if the report was ready and it'll be weeks later, but there should be a lot more clarity on that within the next 30 to 60 days.\n\n00:29:31,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll make a comment coming back to the big, beautiful bill, which, you know, for biotech might've been the small, beautiful bill. Um, the.\n\n00:29:42,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n The main— kind of big picture thing that came out of that bill was we didn't raise taxes, right? So we were on a path for taxes to be raised by schedule. The tax cuts that were put in place in the last Trump administration were extended. So unlike in the Reagan administration, where you saw huge expansion in the markets after the tax cuts that came in around 1980.\n\n00:30:06,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right now, we're just kind of preserving the tax rates that we had. If that bill had not passed, which to me seemed like a possibility at times, it could have actually been quite bad in the sense that the markets would not have done so well. Um and markets don't do well. You know, that does ultimately feed into risk appetite, which impacts biotech sector.","char_start":23843,"char_end":27988,"start_time":"00:26:24","end_time":null}

Um and markets don't do well. You know, that does ultimately feed into risk appetite, which impacts biotech sector.\n\n00:30:28,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n I do think that, despite, you know, some of the damage that the Trump administration's done to our sector, you know, taking down parts of the FDA and so on, that overall. There may yet be benefits coming from impacts on the overall market, which we're starting to see. Those impacts will affect risk appetite, Bruce Booth likes to call it— you know, risk— risk on environment. We've definitely not been in a risk on environment as that happens more and more. We should start to see early-stage biotech pick up, but that's a multi-year process.\n\n00:31:05,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tim, I have to ask you, because I know you've written a lot about the correlation between biotech stock performance and interest rates. Does the Big Beautiful Bill change the way you're thinking about where the. Where interest rates are going to be heading in the future?\n\n00:31:21,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Deficit spending. Yeah.\n\n00:31:23,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, I mean, deficit spending is not good for rates at all. And so that's not good for biotech. But, you know, the thing that I think we're all watching very carefully are tariffs. And, you know, fundamentally, I think Trump views tariffs as a bludgeon to negotiate deals with other countries and not something that he actually wants to do.\n\n00:31:46,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tariffs are not desired by the Republican Party to be at 50%. And so.\n\n00:31:52,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, if tariffs went up, that's going to be highly inflationary, most likely. And that would be definitely bad for rates. And that would be definitely bad for biotech. So I'm personally optimistic about the course of inflation. Despite the big, beautiful bill. And I think that will feed back positively biotech. But again, this is not like something that happens next week. So the effects of the Reagan Expansionary policies on the market took five to 10 years to play out. So, you know, long term, I think things look really good for our sector. You know what happens next week? I have no idea.\n\n00:32:31,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n As, as you shouldn't um well let's shift gears again to the third topic of discussion today, which is the FDA.\n\n00:32:38,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n There have been a couple now kind of surprise announcements this week. Tim, you just mentioned today's news on. Potentially trading faster review times for fair price differential between U. S. and ex-U. S. markets. But really, the big surprise I think came out.\n\n00:32:57,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Days ago or was it maybe just yesterday when The FDA released all of these CRLs for products that have since been approved.\n\n00:33:06,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n But received CRLs in the 2020 to 2024 timeframe. Just your overall, maybe you could just remind us what happened. Give us your thoughts on why the FDA chose to do this.\n\n00:33:19,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, such an interesting move by the FDA to like publish out of the blue, you know, 200 complete response letters, like in a zip file, right? Sort of, sort of, I mean, isn't it interesting that the you know, the Epstein list got like, lost this week. And then all of a sudden, it's like, oh, here's everybody's CRL. And. I guess to me, um, I think we should have transparency about regulatory decision-making, that's not a bad thing. But to ex-post release everybody's CRLs struck me as very odd. And I started reading through the CRLs. I mean, it's pretty interesting reading. A lot of companies were clearly not transparent with the markets as to what was going on. And that's not just a little biotech. I mean, some of these big pharma companies were getting CRLs that they never mentioned to the market.\n\n00:34:16,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I'd be very curious to hear, Eric, what you think and what Tess and Brad think about this sort of sudden decision to expose industry by releasing all of the CRLs.","char_start":27688,"char_end":31809,"start_time":"00:30:28","end_time":null}

One thing I will say about this FDA is number one, they are master communicators. Like the difference in communication between this FDA and, like, the videos that they do on social media.\n\n00:35:15,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n All the, you know, the tweets and the TV interviews and everything they did, like on a scale of one to ten as communicators, this FDA is like a nine and a half, like whatever you think of the messaging, just as their skill as communicators, they're like. Nine and a half, borderline ten. And I would give the last administration's FDA more like a four at best.\n\n00:35:39,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'll give credit where credit is due there. And then on the CRL issue specifically, a lot of people have brought this up. What they announced and what they put out is what hopefully is a first step, which is they've only made Publix. CRLs for drugs that ultimately ended up getting approved. And that's a good step, so I'm not going to bash them over the head for not going all the way with it.\n\n00:36:08,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm giving them credit for doing this. But the thing that we want as an industry is we want this to change people's behavior. You know, we want this. to be designed in a way if you're a small or, like you said, a big pharma company that's maybe not traditionally been 100% honest in how you've communicated those things. We want this to be designed in a way that people will be You know, that this will change their behavior and make them be a lot more honest. My guess is, especially with the smaller companies, if they just leave it where it is today— of like drugs that ultimately get approved— I doubt it will change anything. Because if you're a small company, you're just desperate to survive and eventually succeed one day. Down the road.\n\n00:36:58,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n So it would be nice if they start, like, Capricor got a CRL today for their cell therapy for DMD cardiomyopathy. It would have been amazing to see that CRL today. And maybe if Capricorn knew that that was coming out, you know, maybe or maybe not, you know, obviously it's just. A guessing game we don't know— maybe it would have changed how they communicate. The result of that— to the public— so really good first step. Credit to credit where credit is due. Um and it would uh be nice if it's just the first step and that this expands and um applies to all CRLs in the future.\n\n00:37:42,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tess, what's your take on what's going on at the FDA, either with regard to this initiative or just more broadly? He thinks that things are operating.\n\n00:37:51,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I think this initiative, definitely very encouraging. You know, as Brad says, I think the more, you know, the more the better. Getting the, you know, the CRLs for unapproved drugs is ultimately what would have a bigger impact, I think, on that behavior.\n\n00:38:08,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think that, you know, the FDA more broadly.\n\n00:38:12,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n Look, we saw some, I think Stat had a couple of headlines over this past week about just some of the internal turmoil and challenges that staff is experiencing, which sounds.\n\n00:38:28,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n sounds really unfortunate, right? I think that the FDA is doing an incredible job. You know, really managing, continuing to manage things with a lot of the companies that they're working with. Fortunately, many of the portfolio companies that we talk with, they continue to have constructive interactions. But. It's hard for me to. Think that that's sustainable when I see things like the stat articles that talk about how groups have really been overturned and just how low morale and everything is.\n\n00:39:03,870 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think it's something where we won't really know until we just have more time. And.","char_start":31509,"char_end":35938,"start_time":"00:34:16","end_time":null}

And.\n\n00:39:13,549 [SPEAKER_1]\n understand how some of these FDA-like early interactions are playing out as well, right? It's one thing to- get drugs approved, it's another thing to, you know, respond in a timely way to, um, you know, briefing books on end of phase two meetings and pre-IND meetings and stuff like that. So.\n\n00:39:35,529 [SPEAKER_1]\n you know, I would say. Generally, it seems like the FDA is having really constructive engagement with a lot of companies.\n\n00:39:49,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n really trying to keep things on schedule. I have heard in several instances of just senior reviewers being gone, and so maybe not having the quality of feedback that one might have received in the past. And that's obviously unfortunate. But. We'll have to take some more time. And I think companies are going to continue to just. work with other regulatory agencies as well because you can't. You know, I don't think we can really have confidence that everything is going to be. You know, continue smoothly with the FDA until we have more time and companies can't afford to. take that risk.\n\n00:40:32,100 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'll just pile on to what Brad said earlier. I mean, both Dr. Macari and Dr. Prasad are master communicators. That's kind of how they got their job, right? They were internet personalities or social media types.\n\n00:40:44,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh, they're extraordinarily well versed in getting out there in front of the media and cameras, of course, they're part of an administration that features many leaders who know how to communicate. Through electronic channels. So no surprise there. I guess the big question that I have and Tess, you touched on that is: what type of managers they are internally, in addition to the stat news article, there was also an article in BioSentry that reported on a leaked internal memo from Dr. Prasad to his staff.\n\n00:41:17,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n The good thing about that memo was Dr. Bassani, It. at least is aware enough to know that he may have some issues with regard to staffing and turnover and morale. And he's trying to address those issues by communicating. is urgency and hiring new. uh new review staff members and and also try to create an open environment where conflict is.\n\n00:41:45,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n is able to be brought forth and communication internally is stressed. So I almost got the sense from reading that BioCentury article that Dr. Prasad has a good sense of what isn't going well at the agency right now. Maybe he's focusing some of his efforts more internally as opposed to externally, which might not be a bad thing. In order to try and head some of that stuff off before it really becomes a problem for our industry.\n\n00:42:12,630 [SPEAKER_3]\n But in terms of a problem for industry, we did have this very unfortunate case of Capricor, Brad, that you referenced. Maybe just want to walk through.\n\n00:42:23,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Walk through our listeners on what has happened. With regard to Capricorn's DMD.\n\n00:42:29,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n MBA that was sorry boa that was filed now a few months ago and got the CRL today.\n\n00:42:37,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is this for me?\n\n00:42:39,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n If you don't mind, I know you're on it.\n\n00:42:42,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sure. Well, I'm kind of not. So I guess I'll give it a shot.\n\n00:42:49,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n So this is the.\n\n00:42:51,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n A cell therapy for like, you know, we're very, we.\n\n00:42:58,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n We commonly talk about DMD and we think of like the streptas of the world. This is a little different. So this is a cell therapy. And the indication that they're going after for this approval is very specific. It's cardiomyopathy related to DMD.\n\n00:43:16,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I actually don't know enough about the history of it other than to know, like, obviously got the CRL because like the data was like marginal going into this. And the other thing that's a really key element here.","char_start":35638,"char_end":39864,"start_time":"00:39:03","end_time":null}

And the other thing that's a really key element here.\n\n00:43:33,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n and maybe makes this decision the right thing to do is they have the same therapy in a key trial for a slightly different indication within DMD and a big trial that's going to read out like any day now. Like, I think it's scheduled for August or September.\n\n00:43:54,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n And even though it's not for cardiomyopathy, I think it's more of like a traditional muscle strength indication.\n\n00:44:02,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n It'll give us maybe a better view into whether this therapy and this whole cell therapy approach that they have actually works or not. So this is not a situation where it's like, uh— accelerated approval and we're not gonna know, like, for years and years about, like, you know, a follow-up study. Um, like that's like confirmatory, like, we're gonna to know a lot more about this exact same therapy within like the next 30 days. And so the the big controversy is, uh, you know, the head of— I'm drawing a blank on her name, but, you know, the lady. Yeah, she was. She had scheduled an adcom for this, I think, around like this time. By the way, the decision date for this was August 31st, so the CRL actually came a little early. But um.\n\n00:45:00,299 [SPEAKER_0]\n The reporting that had been in the news, I think Stat News, like Adam, was the main person who kind of dug this up.\n\n00:45:09,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n Based off of his reporting, what he was saying is that Binet was really not a believer in this. And part of what led to her departure was.\n\n00:45:20,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n He like you know scrapped the adcom and was like, 'There's no way we're approving this, like, based off of the you know the this indication and the existing data that they have.' So that's pretty much all I know about it. I'm sure that's a small fraction of like all the details of the story, but that that's my impression. But I think we'll know a lot more about this in a month or two. And I think it's probably.\n\n00:45:44,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n What little I know about it, I actually think this makes sense. Like, if there's some huge trial readout, that's going to give us a clearer picture into the. The utility of this therapy in like a month or two. Why go out on a limb based off of what appears to be thinner data on some approval right now when you'll know more about it in a couple of months?\n\n00:46:05,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n Brad, I'll add, just reading the press release that the company put out this morning. It is kind of interesting reading, right? Because the company says, 'Hey, we had a mid-cycle review and everything was fine.' And now they tell us that we have not met the statutory requirement for efficacy.\n\n00:46:26,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, I'm kind of on the FDA side here. I'm not saying that they made the right or wrong decision. I don't know the specific facts, but. Shouldn't the FDA have the right to?\n\n00:46:36,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Read all the evidence and then, you know, at some point make a decision. So just because the mid-cycle meeting seems to be okay doesn't mean that you're going to get an approval. And so I just thought that the implication in the press release that somehow the FDA wasn't straight with the company seemed to be a little bit off to me.\n\n00:46:55,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n I agree with that, Tim.\n\n00:46:58,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Another thing that I think should change about the FDA is just the rigid calendaring of everything and like another good example, like if you look back and especially now that like um we've had controversy about it, so like sticking with DMD, think of Serepta's um gene editing program. So remember, it got accelerated approval. I'm sure I'll have my date slightly wrong. But it got accelerated approval, like in the summer. And it had a big confirmatory trial readout scheduled for like seven months, like less than six months later.","char_start":39564,"char_end":43687,"start_time":"00:43:16","end_time":null}

And it had a big confirmatory trial readout scheduled for like seven months, like less than six months later.\n\n00:47:41,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n And if you didn't have to worry about, well, they filed on this date, so the decision has to be by this date and like all of this stuff, like you would think a rational person, if you weren't confined to all of those rules and regulations, would say. Should we give this an approval and then six months later find out whether this other, you know, follow-up study has succeeded or not, like the right thing to do is let's just like decide on all this once we have the totality of the data in front of us? But in those types of situations, you have to follow these, you know, PDUFA rules, and I don't think that serves medicine, as well as it should. And it sounds to me, again, what little I know about it, that this Capricorn situation is a very similar thing. They filed this thing, and they had to get a decision by such and such date, and they were going to have this key data a month later. Well, a rational person would say, let's just wait until we see what that data looks like.\n\n00:48:43,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that sounds like exactly what the FDA did in this case.\n\n00:48:47,940 [SPEAKER_3]\n Brad, I'm glad I put you on the spot because you certainly know a lot more about this than you admitted. And I think all your points are very valid. Uh, but the one beef the company does seem to have— and this came out on their call earlier today— is that, uh, they, in their opinion, have kind of been dealing with two FDA's, two sequential review staffs. When it was Nicole Verdun and her team, everything was hunky-dory. They were moving toward approval. They had that mid-cycle review staff meeting. And things were fine. And the FDA had accepted their statistical plan and analyses, even though part of that was post hoc. Obviously, Nicole was dismissed. The Stat News article came out as to why.\n\n00:49:27,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n And as of today, it seems like they're dealing with. But very different. FDA, one that is being directed by Dr. Prasad, who Obviously, it has taken issue with the circumstances that we find ourselves in. Maybe they're to no one's fault. I don't know. But I think it is a little bit unfair that the companies had to go through this turmoil in staff and turnover in staff.\n\n00:49:50,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n Had to deal with the consequences of it. But Tess, any thoughts here? It's certainly a controversial matter.\n\n00:49:59,109 [SPEAKER_1]\n Nothing I have to add. I think very thorough discussion.\n\n00:50:05,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay. Well, hopefully, again, as you laid out earlier, Tess, the FDA can sort of know right the ship and and and make sure that um things are moving in the right direction. We still are obviously in a very tumultuous situation with regard to the status of this agency. So maybe we should add the FDA to. Another potential future risk that we're not quite sure we've got clean sailing on just yet. Let's move to some better topics. We did have some good news, both on the approval front and then some good data sets that were reported today too. Brad, do you want to handle the CalVista approval for HAE?\n\n00:50:45,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And of course there's a whole underlying FDA saga with that one too. And I may just. especially for time, just skip that part of it. But this is an oral cow crying. Inhibitor for HAE attacks and It's the first ever oral drug period for HAE attacks. There's IV drugs and there's injected drugs. And now this seems like a really convenient thing. So credit to them. for getting it across the finish line and the science that they like the way they design these molecules in order to achieve this, obviously they're not the first to have the idea of having an oral therapy. It was pretty elegant in how they were able to design this and succeed. The drug is called Ecterly. I thought there's like an interesting backstory behind the name. It's supposed to stand for 'act early.'\n\n00:51:46,790 [SPEAKER_0]\n So if you're, you know, an HAE.","char_start":43387,"char_end":47634,"start_time":"00:47:41","end_time":null}

One thing that I think is interesting about this story, um, and it also is like, uh, you know, are the economics of our industry like ideal? So this therapy, it's like $60. It's like $16,700 is the list price, like per pill.\n\n00:52:22,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n And my own personal editorial on this is, I think that puts patients in a tricky situation. Because, if you're like, you know, do I like every time I swallow a pill? It's like somebody has to pay 17,000. Um, you might use it a lot less, or you might think twice about using something in a scenario where, if it was, you know, a lot less than that, you know, it'd be an easier decision. So, one thing I wonder over the very long term, I think that Cal Vista had to. Price it this way because that's how payers you know deal with these things today. But I think it'd be interesting if a company like that in the future is somehow able to have, like, a subscription model. Um, where you maybe pay an annual fee. And you know, whether you need to take one pill or you need to take, you know, a few a month. And you don't have to worry about the financial consequences of something like that, where it's like an emergency attack-type situation rather than like a chronic disease.\n\n00:53:27,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n Couldn't agree with you more, Brad. I feel like for you know, PRN drugs, right? You know, for, you know, several of these.\n\n00:53:37,229 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, for diseases like that. I couldn't agree with you more. I think a model like that is really the right way to think about it.\n\n00:53:45,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n And Tess, would you like to walk us through the kind of wild week that Pro Kidney has had?\n\n00:53:51,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n My goodness. I mean, yes. So I think, you know, so maybe let's start with just what Pro Kidney is developing. So ProKidney is developing a cell therapy. Uh, real parent cell, um, and uh, you know, this is a a cell therapy that they've that they've been developing. And they shared an update on their phase two.\n\n00:54:19,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n Where they essentially were comparing, they had two groups that got slightly different injection schedules. For this cell therapy.\n\n00:54:33,150 [SPEAKER_1]\n And These were These were patients who have chronic kidney disease, right? Chronic kidney disease, really, really challenging indication to treat, right? Not a whole lot of drugs. That, you know, have been successful in actually, you know, treating chronic kidney disease.\n\n00:54:56,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n What they showed is essentially with these two different dosing schedules, this was an open-label study, and they looked at the EGFR slope before the study, and then they said, 'Okay, let's look at the EGFR slope after the last injection.' And what they saw is they saw an improvement, pre-injection versus post-injection in EGFR slope. And for one of the groups in particular, the group that received two injections, they saw a more kind of dramatic change in EGFR slope, pre-injection versus post-injection. So, you know, how do we know this matters? Well, you know, what ProKidney is doing is they are, you know, also in a phase three study. that is a randomized study where they are, you know, where they're looking at this, you know, cell therapy, and that could be the basis for approval.\n\n00:55:59,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I think that's expected to read out at some point in 2026. And so I think there was a very positive stock response. The stock has gone from like 61 cents before these data to now being at you know, to now being at almost $5 a share, right? Companies at over one and a half billion. you know, market capitalization on these data. So it's another reminder that You know, with biotech stocks, it doesn't really matter what you were trading at before.","char_start":47334,"char_end":51602,"start_time":"00:51:46","end_time":null}

And investors will kind of bid you up to what they think that, you know, that data means in terms of, you know, what your drug might be worth. Still, like there's a lot of, you know, a lot of debates, I would say about. Um, you know, what these phase two data mean and how they should be interpreted. You know, I think questions are like, well, you know, hey, this is open label. How would this look compared to placebo? How about SGLT2 use? There's a lot of nuances around, like, the timing of follow-up, the timing of you know, when injections were given. You know, that I think we'll need to have, you know, some more information on, and we'll ultimately really find out. You know, will ultimately really find out in the phase three.\n\n00:57:25,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thank you for that excellent recap. Tim, you get the last word. I know you've been thinking a lot about obesity post the ADA meeting a couple weeks back.\n\n00:57:33,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, this is kind of a long time after the meeting, but I did work on a report which we put out this week. Just kind of talking about the obesity market, I would say that You know, when you really contemplate where Lilly is, they have quite a formidable portfolio. So it was a surprise to me to see how strong their Amlin was. It was a surprise to me to see how strong their muscle drug was. So all of a sudden. Lilly has a strong oral, strong amylin, strong muscle drug. Obviously, they have Ritatrutide coming in. And so when you start to look at all of the competition, you know, what all of these biotechs and other large farmers have in obesity. I think it's going to be much tougher for them to compete against Lilly. And you know, there's another thing coming up, which is semaglutide is going to be generic, presumably sometime around 2030. We don't know exactly when. And so, you know, generic semaglutide is going to be very inexpensive and that drug works quite well. So the key point I made in the report was that this market is a little bit less open than it seemed before.\n\n00:58:38,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n I do think that there are some companies that look good. I like QuarkCell. I like Chilera. Those are companies that have assets that could specifically compete against Lilly's best asset in that category, but just quite interesting to see how quickly. This market has matured.\n\n00:58:56,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n fascinating stuff. And congrats on another terrific report. Tess, Tim, Brad, we're out of time. But thank you all for sharing your insights. Thank our listeners for joining us too. We'll see you all next week.","char_start":51302,"char_end":54269,"start_time":"00:56:32","end_time":null}

Or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. As well, you will find our disclosures on the Hangout page. Please note that our commentary should not be construed as stock investment advice. I would note it's investing in biotech. Is as much as ever challenging even for experts. And I'm actually going to start on this topic because I'm biotech too challenging to ever be anything other than domain for real experts and specialists? Yaron, I'm going to pick on you first for that one.\n\n00:00:59,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh boy, this is going to be a spicy one. Um.\n\n00:01:03,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I would say, look, it depends on what we're talking about and it depends on which time of history are we talking about. If we're going back to the bubble, everything was going up, so you can also invest in ETFs, you know. If you're talking about large-cap bikes, they're pharma. They're not any different than investing in a pharma company.\n\n00:01:24,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n We all know, Josh, you remember the— days when mid-cap biotech was becoming large-cap biotech. And the call was, you don't need to invest in the S &P, just invest in these large-cap biotechs as they innovate, because these are amazing businesses. But let's face it.\n\n00:01:40,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n Environment, the smaller and mid-careerly volatile. We have obviously more concerns with FDA. We'll talk with Ultragenyx and some concerns about where the agency is going. It's tough. It's volatile. I mean, this is not for the faint of heart. So people need to be careful, unquestionably.\n\n00:01:57,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n Can I chime in on that question, Josh? Absolutely. So I think the sector has a serious credibility and accountability problem. And I think that until the industry as a group.\n\n00:02:12,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n And that includes you as analysts and investors and industry people. until that is addressed and is self-policed. This is an industry, unfortunately, which is going to be mostly um ignored. by the larger investment community. I think. And it's, I see it, you know. We can tie this into the Sarepta thing. today where you know we all thought Oh, well, maybe there is a bottom here. Maybe they've cleared the decks. And then literally 12 hours later, we find out about another death that was not disclosed. And if you're looking at this from the outside. What you're seeing is like a raging dumpster fire. Attached to a clown car. And.\n\n00:02:58,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n The only way that this changes is if you guys, as analysts, call out some of the bullshit and investors say, 'Enough is enough' and we're not going to take this anymore. And boards and executives have to be held accountable to these things. And until that happens, I don't see us being anything more than just some niche curiosity that people just laugh at.\n\n00:03:24,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Oh. Anyone else? I love having Adam on these calls. How can you follow that, Josh?\n\n00:03:32,859 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, Mike. Perspective on this is not so much that biotech is tough. Some other things are easier. You can get really good returns these days, and you have been for a long time. Whether it's a bubble or not is by investing in tech. It's a little bit more understandable. You can hold it. It's tangible. Unless you get into quantum and and some new LLM, but even then you can try it out. You don't have that here. So you add that to what Adam said, it makes it tough.\n\n00:04:03,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I'll just add, I think it's, look, biotech's always been hard and that's why it's such a specialist investor domain. But I think the and Adam alluded to this in terms of generalist investors. I mean, if you look at the XBI and we can debate if that's the best, like, index or not, but whether you look at three-year, five-year, or ten-year returns. People are going to look at that and say, 'whether I try to understand it or not.' or 'whether they can clean it up.' I think that is one of the biggest challenges we have is just this sector. has not really moved in ten years.","char_start":0,"char_end":4374,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I think that is one of the biggest challenges we have is just this sector. has not really moved in ten years.\n\n00:04:38,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think there's not a lot of signs for hope and optimism. I mean, we can talk about it insularly. about, oh, FDA signaling something positive or. Or it looks like tariffs might not be as bad or MFN is going to go away. Like we can talk about that. But at the end of the day, I think investors are, you know. Capital allocators and You know? Especially with interest rates that remain high. How can you justify putting a lot of capital to work in this sector when it just hasn't delivered? So I think that's a big, big point.\n\n00:05:10,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n I just think it's the self-inflicted wounds that are so frustrating.\n\n00:05:15,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, it's not like, I mean, everyone understands that biology is really hard, that there's so much risk. And you know, bad things are going to happen, of course. That's everyone knows that, but it's the self-inflicted stuff— it's the stuff that just doesn't need to happen. That keeps happening all the time. That's where it gets. That needs to be cleaned up.\n\n00:05:35,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n Adam, let's move to that. And I just want to, Josh, if it's OK, I want to because not all of our listeners, some of them might have like had a busy 24 hours, but. So we'll lead off, which, you know, Adam, you know, kind of, you know, let the match on this a little bit. I think it's worth talking about. You know, earlier this week, I think the market was surprised that Sarepta announced a restructuring refocus of the company, laying off more than a third of the employees. Really moving away from gene therapy. We all have talked, you know, a lot about the two deaths in the DMD. Right, commercial product. Um, and so everybody thought, okay, wow. The revenues guidance has come down. Right. Black box warning. Like, so some major communication updates from Sarepta. That sent the stock down, or I'm sorry, sent the stock up. Because they thought that they had this debt overhang that they were doing the right thing to get to cash flow positive.\n\n00:06:37,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n They said that there was a floor of the gene therapy of 500 million that they could count on. And so everybody was really reacting. And that was going to be the news of the week this week, which is still the news of the week. But then, as Adam said, 12 hours later. They announced a death. With their limb girdle. Their second program in limb girdle using the same vector RH 74. So, and the, you know, limb girdle is a, not like DMD. These are. Patients who live longer lives. This was an adult. And so. Like that. The question came, and I think the reporting from Stat and others have been great on this. It sounds like the company knew about this death. For maybe upwards of a month. Did not disclose it on the call. And this big communication, either in the press release or on the call. They were even asked by a specific analyst. Did safety have anything to do with jettisoning the limb girdle. And moving that aside. Was there a signal there?\n\n00:07:38,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n And they didn't deny that, but they didn't answer the question— is what I recall. Again, I'm trying to piece all this together. But so that's the setting the table, Adam. Yeah. You want to add to that.","char_start":4076,"char_end":7598,"start_time":"00:04:38","end_time":null}

But so that's the setting the table, Adam. Yeah. You want to add to that.\n\n00:07:50,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, I mean, but an important clarification here is that, you know, you said that they announced this death. Surrupted did not announce this death. Right. This was a death that was that was. first reported by BioCentury. It was then followed up very quickly by Endpoints. We were pursuing the same story. Our competitors beat us to the story, and good for them. Hat tip to those guys for getting the story before we did. But. We had also heard about this. So the company did not disclose this. And unless there were reporters out there pursuing these kinds of stories, there wouldn't have been a disclosure here. So I think that's a really important point to make. And, you know, the call today where, you know, Doug Ingram, their CEO, you know, didn't back down. He said this was not a material event. You know, we kept talking about the decision to close down the limb girdle. Most of the limb girdle programs was around. was, you know, an MPV based decision, you know, a financial decision and not a clinical or safety decision. And, you know, that may be so, but.\n\n00:08:52,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, when you are asked point blank on a call with analysts, when someone asks you whether there were any safety issues related to these programs, and you don't say— you basically avoid the question, so it's a lie by omission. That's a problem. I mean, from a credibility standpoint, like how do you. Like. Thank you. How do you evaluate a company like that, a management team like that, going forward? And again, it's a self-inflicted thing because they could have been.\n\n00:09:22,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n They could have been fully transparent. And this wouldn't have happened.\n\n00:09:26,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n Adam, I just want to highlight also, you commented on X. That it was, maybe, exacerbated. This by the fact that, and this was before the reporting came out with the Limb Girdle death. That there were promotions, there were increases, and that there was a little bit of tone deafness, if you will, of doing that. Right. Yeah.\n\n00:09:51,920 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, look, on the same day that you fire 500 employees, but 36% of the workforce, and then you announce promotions and pay raises for the top executives. I mean, Look, I'm not a PR guy. Yeah. You know, but I mean, that does not sit well. And I can tell you that we've spoken to. You know, quite a few of the laid off Sarepta employees that last, you know, 24 hours or so.\n\n00:10:17,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, that really angers a lot of people.\n\n00:10:20,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n that How do you do that?\n\n00:10:23,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, Josh, Jeroen, Sam, you guys want to chime in on this?\n\n00:10:27,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I was going to ask you, Chris. I mean, Sarepta used to be the CEO, and it's a company that does have a fairly lengthy history of controversy. Why do you think that is?\n\n00:10:39,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I mean, look, I can only speak to You know, going back to the history of the Teplerson is where it all started. And that was, largely, and people don't appreciate this fully.\n\n00:10:52,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n The FDA is not a monolith, right? There are. Raging debates, disagreements, different opinions within the hierarchy, between the hierarchy and the divisions. And during my tenure alone, we went through three different division directors. And CNS is arguably known as one of the more conservative and challenging and Thank you. There's a long history of that. And so we had a really good interactions and a good signal with the first division director. And then there was an interim director that came in, that kind of reversed all of that decisions. And that's when it became controversial and they brought in A third one, Billy Dunn, who kind of got it back on track. But then there was the protest that happened after I left, after the first ad comp. So I think part of it is this has just been a highly visible kind of charge. story that is a little bit of the lightning rod for industry trends. There was a period where people thought Sarepta was getting too much favor or has gotten too much favor from the FDA.","char_start":7298,"char_end":11712,"start_time":"00:07:38","end_time":null}

There was a period where people thought Sarepta was getting too much favor or has gotten too much favor from the FDA.\n\n00:11:58,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think it's just one of these. Stories. that is always not clear. I mean, the Teplerson was controversial because it was. arguably a small data set. that was not unequivocal. And that you could have arguments on both sides, right? And as CEO, I felt that it was doing something. I didn't think it was a cure-all or the best technology that was ever produced, but we thought it deserved to be approved.\n\n00:12:22,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think—um— But I will say this, what I tried to do as CEO was really be as transparent as I possibly could. I mean, back then we were putting FDA letters. Quotes from FDA communications into our press releases. Which not many companies have ever done that right. And that was just to say, look, you can disagree with my interpretation of it, but here's what they told us. And this is how we're interpreting it. And so I think the transparency is the issue. And I think that's what Adam hit on. I think it's the credibility that, you know, do you believe? What the management teams and the CEOs are telling you. And this is what I know, having been a CEO, I mean, every, you know, by-sider, when they go to these investment conferences and I have like stacked meetings with people, they're asking me the same question. Eight different ways to see if, like, my expression changes or do I answer it a different way? Or, I mean, it's all about how much do we trust this person? Right and can we believe what they're telling us and that credibility, I think, is a really important part.\n\n00:13:30,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n For by-siders to invest and trust the story that they're being told by a management team.\n\n00:13:37,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n So one of the things that Macri is talking about, right, is now beginning to post the CRLs publicly. I cannot, I think we're all going to agree. We need that badly. Now, there's going to be an element of information that's going to have to be redacted for confidentiality for legal reasons. But as much of it should be unredacted. acted and left publicly. And I actually think that this is a governance board and general counsel issue. Some of you might know, we spent a few years in a company and as an officer, and one of the things I always thought is when you leave Wall Street and you become, you know, a Section 16 officer, someone like a Gandalf would show up with a book of like 3,600 pages. It would give you, here's the rules for public disclosure. That book does not exist. It's all a question of how much risk does the management and the board and the GC want to take, and the CEO and CFO, et cetera, and ultimately risk-reward. And there's obviously guidelines, but so much of it is up to the scrotum.\n\n00:14:40,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's absolutely not okay. This is really a governance issue in our view.\n\n00:14:45,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, and Adam, to your point, an integrity issue that I think our industry almost more than any other industry owes. To the patients, if nobody else who often gets forgotten, but lack of disclosures, lack of integrity, cost the industry, and cost patients whose basically built on, our whole industry is built off of. Any other comments on Sarepta before we move on?\n\n00:15:15,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n The only other thing I'd say, and Adam, I think you also wrote an article about this. It was about a year ago.\n\n00:15:21,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n Where there was that conference where it was taken off the PPMD. Website and there was a you know kind of a mom that was in the audience that was just saying, 'We need more disclosure.' You know, we're putting our kids at risk. And it almost felt prophetic. Uh, in terms of you know, you know what was tried to you know be suppressed. And raising the voice of the patients. And Christine McSherry wrote a blog post that I highlighted on social media recently around this same idea just after the second death. But this is not something that wasn't discussed within the Duchenne communities and transparency around safety risks and benefits.","char_start":11412,"char_end":15728,"start_time":"00:11:58","end_time":null}

It's not a homogenous community, just like the disease is not, right? There are people who— are very much in support of Sarepta and like what they're doing. And there are people in the community who don't and have concerns. And that's healthy, right? I don't think that no one wants to have, like, there shouldn't be unanimous unanimity. Uh, amongst everything, right? I think that one of the problems that's coming up is that, and you raise it in that story that I wrote about a year ago, a little over a year ago, was that, you know, at these forums, in this case of the PPMD conference, where a mom, someone who has a son with Duchenne, who gets up, and raises concerns, wants to criticize, Sarepta in a public forum, as should be her right. Um, is it kind of harassed afterwards and then her comments are censored. Her comments are taken, you know, the video you know, at Sarepta's request, the video was edited and her comments were edited out.\n\n00:17:05,859 [SPEAKER_4]\n And delete it. That's a problem.\n\n00:17:09,099 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, that is a problem. And, you know, and that's not good for that's not good for debate. It's not good for the community. It's it, you know, and And there are knock-on effects to that. And I think that. When we see what happened last night, you know, you can draw a through line to that.\n\n00:17:26,839 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep.\n\n00:17:29,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's move on. Yeah, Josh, I was going to say, you mentioned the CRL, and maybe we can cover the rare.\n\n00:17:35,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, no, hold on, hold on, Chris, hold on. Yep, yeah, thank you. So, because, what I want to get to now actually is an interesting juxtaposition.\n\n00:17:44,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Amelix hosted a webinar at Endo for their post-bariatric hypoglycemia program and their GLP-1 inhibitor. It seemed to be very well received by investors, based on the stock move after post-bariatric hypoglycemia. As a very underappreciated potential complication of bariatric surgery, where patients actually struggle with significant hypoglycemia that requires a very restrictive diet, ironically, right? Because they're having bariatric surgery to control their diet, and then they wind up almost being forced to adhere to a nearly impossible diet to adhere to. But I think what's notable is this management team, Josh and Justin, who I'd heard such great things about. Before I had a chance to meet them earlier this year. And as you recall, talk about integrity. When the Rovio trial in ALS failed, they were very quick to pull that product from the market. And they're two young co-CEOs who I do think bring a tremendous amount of integrity to the job.\n\n00:18:53,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I think it's really interesting to compare and contrast and we need Amlex's, the type of leaders. and young leaders that Josh and Justin are. who really care about doing the right thing for patients, who care about appropriate integrity and disclosures, etc. So I just kind of wanted to put that. After the conversation that we just had. Now moving on. To regulatory. Um, it feels like Washington and the FDA is in the news every single week. Right, which is something very new because they were rarely um in the news. Adam you and your colleagues at Stat have been doing an absolutely incredible job in kind of helping us understand what's happening at the agency. And it feels like a little mixed messages. We have, you know, kind of messages from the top telling us everything's okay.","char_start":15428,"char_end":19385,"start_time":"00:16:00","end_time":null}

Quite so okay. Maybe morale's not quite as good as they'd have us believe, and maybe drug approval process is being slowed down in ways that they they'd not want us to believe— as resulting from um stresses on the the agency we've seen a couple of crls so we'll get to that particular one, Chris, in just a second. But curious to hear folks' perspectives on the FDA and, are we on stable ground? Where do we expect this to go? Adam, if you've got some views. Yourself because that again has been so exemplary here.\n\n00:20:33,290 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I really appreciate the kind words, and I will share those with my colleagues who have done just a tremendous amount of work. Lizzie Lawrence is our reporter who specifically covers the FDA from DC, and she's done a great job.\n\n00:20:47,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n What a time to be covering the FDA, right?\n\n00:20:52,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, yeah, you know, I, I mean, I, if it's okay, I mean, cause I actually do, I don't have a ton more time to be here. Uh, I gotta get back to work, but I, you know, with respect to what you're saying. Josh, I think we can talk a little bit about the CRL and talked about ultragenics. On our podcast, the Read Out Loud podcast yesterday, you know, we did speak with, we interviewed Emil Kakas, who's the CEO of Ultragenics. And as you guys know, you probably talk about, you know, they did receive a CRL for their gene therapy for San Filippo syndrome. And it was based around. CMC issues, manufacturing issues. There wasn't anything clinical. There were no clinical shortcomings in the package that stopped it from being approved. And it was really interesting to talk to Amelia today. And I encourage everybody to listen to our podcast at some point over the weekend when you get a chance, because I think. He was pretty transparent about. The stuff that was in there. And it was really what was interesting because it really ties into a lot of the some of the themes I think that you guys have been talking about on the show and everyone has been writing about is that, you know, sort of just the bureaucratic red tape and some of the things that kind of just seem to\n\n00:21:55,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n get in the way of. Um, getting drugs to market as fast as possible and you know, and just like You know, logistical things like he talked to us about one instance he said was that this was in the CRL was a deficiency in the CRL was, you know, there was a disagreement about the number of thermometer probes that were needed in the shipping container for their drug. I don't know if it's frozen or refrigerated. I don't remember that off the top of my head. But they've got like five.\n\n00:22:25,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n Temperature probes monitoring the temperature of this package.\n\n00:22:29,520 [SPEAKER_4]\n And the FDA wanted seven.\n\n00:22:32,409 [SPEAKER_4]\n And that's one of the reasons why this thing got rejected. And it had nothing to do with the drug, nothing to do with safety or advocacy.\n\n00:22:42,400 [SPEAKER_4]\n So it's stuff like that, I think, that frustrates a lot of people in the industry.\n\n00:22:47,920 [SPEAKER_4]\n People have called for, you know, whether it's like assays or things that were just like common sense things where it seems like you could eliminate some of these roadblocks. Hurdles that would go a long way towards um, you know, streamlining drug rules, and you know, it was careful to say, like he doesn't— he's not blaming Marty McCurry, he's not blaming Vinay Prasad, for this CRL. You know, it's more like these are just like these are um, these are just things like built in to the FDA right now that that really just need to be addressed. And, you know, if the leadership, the current leadership today, could do that and they have talked about that. Right. I mean, I think that you've heard. Current FDA leadership has talked about wanting to remove some of these obstacles. Like, if that happens, I think people will be very pleased.","char_start":19085,"char_end":23442,"start_time":"00:19:49","end_time":null}

Um. You know, there have been some things that definitely would you would say, like, wow, are you going to stick your neck out? And, you know, I think some of the, you know, the ousters, you know, the Culver Dunn's departure, you know, internally, and maybe that's the case.\n\n00:24:07,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, or the Cal Vista situation. I don't know if you guys talked about that on a previous show. But.\n\n00:24:13,270 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, just like I again, I just think like these these are like it seems like just like really in the weeds kind of things like, you know. You know, there was another instance, an example that Emil gave us, like, you know, something about, like, the way, like, a certain, like, assays being developed, like, the sterilization procedures that are being used, like. That were just like, you know, he says, like, you know. It's so. It's so dense and it just seems like, why are we wasting our time? Like, debating whether or not, you know, this thing is like, should be sterilized this way or sterilized another way. But again, these are all contributed to, you know, now, you know, now this is a gene therapy that for San Felipe patients that instead of being approved in August. Uh, may not be approved until 2026, and for patients like that, but that's that's a significant, meaningful amount of time.\n\n00:25:03,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so uh, radical transparency, but uh, yeah, you're on please.\n\n00:25:09,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n Maybe I'll just jump in, too, because that was an amazing podcast. Thank you. And we cover ultragenics. Let's zoom out, because there's two other things going on here.\n\n00:25:19,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n To FDA. So recall, this is one of three drugs that is up for accelerated approvals using biomarkers at CBER. This is the Peter Marks program. And the CRL talks about how the totality of the clinical data is supportive. They just ask them to update the clinical data when they refile. But Emil.\n\n00:25:40,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n Your podcast talked about how He's definitely detecting that what's going on is there is a move now to. not to use Heparin sulfate potentially is the biomarker, which is the underpinning for the approval, but rather the neurocognitive endpoint.\n\n00:25:58,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n So there was a shift at FDA.\n\n00:26:01,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n On the clinical side, that wasn't the reason they had the CRL. But that was pretty important. And then the other one is why issue a CRL six weeks or five weeks ahead of the PDUFA? when the company is technically still to resolve these issues.\n\n00:26:18,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think they'd which apparently was not even reviewed by FDA. So it almost seems that there was a political discussion to the political reason that they gave him such an early CRL.\n\n00:26:29,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n Hmm. That's interesting because on one hand, an earlier CRL lets you move faster to respond, but on the other hand, an earlier CRL that winds up in a second CRL because they didn't review the full package the first time is devastating.\n\n00:26:45,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I think this is still an important one to watch because if you look at it on its face, right, a single arm, small study, open label on a biomarker endpoint. When you listen to Vinay and his, you know, kind of questioning around, you know, accelerated approval, obviously disagreements with Marx about that. I think it will be interesting to see if this easily gets approved when they resolve the CMC issue, or if this delay enables them to. Right, um, you know, recast how they think about. Because this was a priority review prior to the new administration coming in, right? You know, presume marks. Was supportive of that.\n\n00:27:28,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that I think Emil probably managed this communication perfectly. But I still want to see that this gets the ultimate approval based on this smaller data set.","char_start":23142,"char_end":27536,"start_time":"00:23:37","end_time":null}

But I still want to see that this gets the ultimate approval based on this smaller data set.\n\n00:27:41,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, Sam, are you back with us? Because I know there's the ODAC panel uh on Thursday— a bit of a surprise for GSK's BCMA ADC, which had a string of positive, um, phase three trials in myeloma. It seemed like they're starting to get some momentum back. But, uh, the ODAC panel isn't thrilled with the risk-benefit profile of the product. I think, in particular, some of the ocular toxin. So, Sam, if you're back with us, because I think you had dropped— if you have any thoughts on that.\n\n00:28:23,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Or, as we're waiting for Sam, I think you're on, you had some views. I'm back. Oh, there we go. Perfect, Sam.\n\n00:28:31,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n Are we on to ODAC? Yeah, we are. I just teed it up for you.\n\n00:28:35,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right, thank you.\n\n00:28:37,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n been listening to all this until this weird um situation where I got thrown off um so talking about CRMs there's another one coming here I'm pretty sure of it we basically had the ODAC meeting for GSK's Balantamab mephedotin or Blenrep. This is the second time this drug wants to come back to market. It's been on the market before. They had a post-approval trial that they were asked to do, and that didn't work out as a single agent. So here they've come back with two trials in combination. And I have to say, it was a bruising ODAC meeting as far as I'm concerned. It was pretty much the FDA saying, look, we don't believe that they've got the dosing right. We don't believe that the tolerability profile, which is related to the dosing, is right and then of course they had a big problem with lack of U. S patients and during it, it was pretty obvious that they were telling the company, uh, that, along the way, that we need you to come up with a different dosing regime.\n\n00:29:39,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Don't start with these two and a half milligrams, etc. Um and and go for it for a lower dose and and GSK obviously didn't didn't follow their advice. So, for these multiple myeloma patients, which is second line, this drug, I'm pretty sure, would not be available in the US. They voted on two trials. Dream 7 and Dream 8, and both of them were ODAC voted down, essentially 7 to 1 and 5 to 3 for the two different trials.\n\n00:30:13,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n What's interesting is that Pastor came along and said, 'Look, why did you not increase your patient recruitment in the US? 5% of patients came from the US and said, 'look,' and you're asking us to approve the drug here for use in the US. The company said, 'Well, other trials have only shown I had about 5%.' Then, of course, you look at it in Cartitude 4 that Jeroen knows a lot about also. And I think I'll pass it on to him in a minute to comment on what this means for other companies.\n\n00:30:46,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n That ended up with 15% of patients in the US.' The only one that I could find very recently that got approved with 5% was Imroz from or Sanofi Sarclisa, but that's this CD38 that's pretty well known, known side effect profile, and already approved in later lines. much easier to to to shepherd that in, so it didn't. This is very important for for um gsg because we estimate it's about 30% of their growth to 2030 in terms of sales. So that's why the stock's taken a bit of a hammering today. I don't know if you don't want to add anything.\n\n00:31:25,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean this is actually important because we're beginning to see definitely a new posture from PASDA and ODAC, right? Historically, oncology, I don't want to have been more lenient. Do a trial design and you beat. And by the way, for the audience, as you remember, DREAM7 and DREAM8 actually showed superiority.","char_start":27236,"char_end":31201,"start_time":"00:27:28","end_time":null}

And by the way, for the audience, as you remember, DREAM7 and DREAM8 actually showed superiority.\n\n00:31:44,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Against the comparison arms, statistically significant with survival trends, which is pretty robust in myeloma. The challenge is twofold. So recently, recall, FDA rejected Columbia for second line DLBCL from the Starglow study because the control arm was outdated. And again, very few patients were in there. US. This is the same situation. The companies are increasingly continuing, and there's actually examples that are up and coming even now. Where companies are running outdated standard of care arms, no longer the standard of care. They're showing superiority or good data relative to that. But then the clinical importance of that is totally questionable because that's not at all what's being used. And that's especially when you're enrolling ex-US.\n\n00:32:32,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, again, we talked about credibility earlier today and what's the issue with biotech. A lot of the issues in biotech is that companies are not really trying to innovate. They're trying to manage risk and they're not really trying to.\n\n00:32:45,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n drugs that are really going to be transformative and are worth the price and will really make a difference. And this is exactly the issue. And I'm glad they're not getting approved.\n\n00:32:54,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, Columbia just got a CRL, literally now.\n\n00:32:58,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Exactly. Which is as expected. It was an eight to one or seven to one. No, I think eight to one. And the other thing is, it sounds like, I mean, they went to pace to say, 'we told you' along the conversations, we told you. And it seems like GSK wanted to run with a dose and a schedule that gave them the best opportunity for seeing a benefit. And at the end of the day, the reality is, if they'd done it, physicians would have found a way and a lot of physicians I've spoken to said, 'look, we know how to manage this drug. We want it on the market. They just didn't, I just wish they'd done a better job with it.\n\n00:33:36,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah.'\n\n00:33:37,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'd also note GSK has been struggling a little bit with its R&D engine for some time now, so another setback for them, but also perhaps reflecting. The extent to which the standard of care in myeloma has completely transformed.\n\n00:33:55,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, really, since the IMIDS came out, it used to just be a mishmash of toxic therapies and transplants.\n\n00:34:05,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Very heterogeneous, almost voodoo-type medicine that we're not serving patients well, and just the number of options that they now have. Survival of patients with myeloma is a testament to the incredible work that our industry does do when it's really firing on all cylinders. All right, let's move to. Market sentiment and Chris said he had some thoughts on second quarter and first half reports on VC investing?\n\n00:34:34,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so first, before we go to the markets, first, I wanted to reinforce what you said about Amalix, just to remind the users, this was the same co-CEOs of Amalix that pulled the ALS drug from the market after they promised they would do that. If they're clinical studies. So again, just going back to the theme of transparency and credibility, we need more management teams like that. The other thing I want to highlight on the FDA sentiment, and it's similar, I see Matt Herpers in the audience, and he has written about kind of FDA communications. And I attended a management, a CEO forum that had about 80 CEOs, private and public, that participated. And we all heard an update from people who were in the McCary room. Uh, they all of them spoke and we heard from New York, Boston, at Bio, San Francisco, and DC, and I just have to say it was, um. And these are not people who are necessarily sympathetic to the politics and the administration, but they, um, universally all walked away with a real feeling of encouragement and a real feeling, they said— even you know as they came in the room, they really listened, that they were taking active notes,","char_start":30901,"char_end":35230,"start_time":"00:31:44","end_time":null}

We were able to compare notes across the different forums and how they were consistent. In those four areas and how they would build on what they had heard. At a previous one. And so what was very interesting was that the CEOs came out as very encouraged and cautious optimism. But a real sense that The feeling was, hey, they are reading the headlines. They are paying attention to what people are saying. And that you know, they're really seemingly committed to prove The naysayer is wrong. And so I do think we need.\n\n00:36:23,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n Folks like Matt and Stat News and others to take a kind of maybe more skeptical. You know, like, can we believe what they're saying? But I can just tell you from the CEO. Forum. That was earlier Monday morning, that was kind of a debrief on all of it. It came out with a pretty positive feeling. That this FDA wants to make changes that are, and obviously we all agree with the CRLs being transparent and we want more transparency. So I wanted to highlight that. But and I think it relates to the market conditions because I think we need to get rid of some of these overhangs of concerns and uncertainty around right policy and right. Are we going to be able to do drug development the way we know how to do it? And there was a particular interest also in bringing. more of those early studies that more and more VCs, including myself, are moving outside of the U. S. because we just feel that the FDA has been too conservative to get drugs into clinical testing. And so there did seem to be a commitment to make it easier to do early studies in the U.\n\n00:37:25,483 [SPEAKER_2]\n S. Anyway, the markets: We had a pretty good Q1 and people had some pretty good signs of the venture investing. But Q2, it really ticked down again. And one trend that really changed was The appetite for early investments, and this is defined as seed or series A, really shifted. In Q1, we had more money in biopharma, I'm speaking. You can look at the different verticals: health tech, devices, diagnostics, and tools and services. But for biopharma, we still, in Q1, had more money going into series A and seed than we did series B and beyond. And that really reversed in Q2 where you really saw series B and later rounds dwarfing more than 2x the amount that went into seed in series A. And that's kind of what I'm seeing on the ground also: it's really, really hard to take a new company and get that seed to series A round. So I think we're still not out of the woods yet.\n\n00:38:27,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n A report out. Dealforma did some earlier data that was reported at endpoints. But the HSBC is getting better and better, I have to say. This is the former SVB. report led by John Norris. They're digging into like even seed investors. They're looking more at specific therapeutic areas and more depth. They're looking like. even on the device side and all of that, they're really going to the next level down of trying to provide some exposition. And one thing that they saw was oncology. We've kind of heard this for a while. That trend is dropping. And the good news is that there does seem to be an embrace of a broader array of therapeutic areas, looking at neuro and CNS. Looking at ophthalmology. We know INI has been big. That's continuing. Cardiometabolic obviously has ticked up. Respiratory, we've made several respiratory investments. So I think you're you're seeing a lot more diversity in the types of investments and really still being product focused and trying to get enough money to get to that elusive clinical proof-of-concept data set.\n\n00:39:29,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n And every VC I know is looking across their portfolio and they better have enough money to get to a clinical data set. readout or they're worried they're not going to be able to finance and they may not have enough money to do it themselves as insiders. So generally speaking, that's that we saw no IPOs in Q2. We did see M&A tick up. So I think that's encouraging. I'll stop there and let anybody else weigh in on the market.\n\n00:39:54,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Let's go to Sam on M&A because I think that's up next.","char_start":34930,"char_end":39426,"start_time":"00:35:47","end_time":null}

Perfect segue, Chris. So we've just done our M&A analysis for the first half. And this is data that I specifically focus on large biopharma, so not just large pharma, taking out biotechs.\n\n00:40:13,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n And as you just said, Chris, in the first half, although the numbers of deals involving the larger biopharma, taking out small guys was fewer than the same equivalent time last year. So 12 deals in the first half. The value was a lot higher, so $30. 7 billion. Of course, two of those we know very well: Blueprint Medicine, announced at least, and Intercellular Therapeutics. So those together come to $23 or so billion.\n\n00:40:42,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n And if you add in Verona, that happened just after the close of the first half, that takes us to about 40 billion. And then that puts it within reach, depending on what happens in the second half. Of being the second best year of 2022 was $73. 6 billion. 2023, of course, was the monster year of 121 billion. So it puts it on a possible trajectory if we get two or three bigger deals this year. To at least beat or meet the same number that we had in 2020. And then, of course, the reason this is worth looking at is because everybody wants their companies at this end of the spectrum of the revolution to be a target for M &A. And a lot of people look at it that way. And that's how they see it as the best exit for them. And in terms of the oncology angle, our data shows that in this type of deal analysis, oncology took over in terms of numbers of deals, INI.\n\n00:41:43,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n Where it had lost it in the first half of 2024. So I would say that, and we're talking about 33rd of the deals were oncology. But the trend is looking good. Maybe that will eventually start reflecting a bit more in the market as a whole.\n\n00:42:03,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n The biotech tape will often trade up after a deal like this is announced. Is that the right move?\n\n00:42:14,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Merck has chosen its company in Verona. They've allocated $10 billion of their capital, which means $10 billion less of Merck capital to deploy for anyone else in terms of M &A in theory. One might suppose that every other stock should trade down a little bit because the probability that they're going to be acquired by Merck just went down a nudge. Any thoughts on that?\n\n00:42:40,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let's try and be glass half-folded.\n\n00:42:44,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n At the end of the day, though, these companies have got massive firepower because we're only looking at the $10 billion. We do an analysis looking at their— dead capacity. And it's into several, you know, a few hundred billion dollars when you look at it, assuming, looking at how far they would go on a debt rebate multiple. So there's plenty of room there. And 10 billion, isn't that like about a year or just under a year of, no, less of Keytruda cash flow?\n\n00:43:16,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n So, you know. And Petruder just got an extra year with the IRA, right? From 28 to 29. So this gives them that much more chance to be able to to potentially manage that eventual patent expiry.\n\n00:43:30,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n And high range.\n\n00:43:32,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n Let me maybe chime in with a comment on the last question. So, if you, the sector, feels better, right? The last month, we're actually 6%, 7%. We're still down overall 10% this year. The question starts becoming: when this happens, you start hearing a lot of debates whether things are better now among investors or whether things are going to turn the corner and sort of crap back down. In the beginning of the year, we put out a report: what do we learn from history? And history, for this sector, is based on how the sector started trading. It suggested that the sector is going to underperform the market, but will basically be flattish. And if that's the case, then the sector needs to move up 10% by the end of the year. I'm in that camp, to be honest. I kind of feel like most of the bad news is already priced in.","char_start":39126,"char_end":43447,"start_time":"00:39:54","end_time":null}

I'm in that camp, to be honest. I kind of feel like most of the bad news is already priced in.\n\n00:44:20,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm incrementally more worried about FDA. I don't think I'm FN is going to come to fruition. And I feel like by and large, things are getting a little bit better. There's better, good launches, great earnings. It's going to be a stunning season, a lot of M &A. So I'm definitely a little bit more bullish or constructive, I should say. How do you all feel into year end?\n\n00:44:42,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm not going to comment on the public markets, I mean, venture, there's still a lot of dry powder on the sidelines and that's why you don't see. Like you've seen down ticks, but. You know, VCs have to use that capital. So and whether it's in a Series B or Series A, they have to deploy that. They have an investment period. And so we still are going to continue to see. private investment. And what I see is when I see a deal like Verona, you see everybody gets excited about that sector. okay, understanding that you might have taken a specific acquirer off the table for that specific target or that specific disease area. But I can tell you, everybody gets very excited that, okay, wow, we have hope that the investors will want to come in because this is a sector of interest. And so I think M&A has kind of a over— I think the positives outweigh the negatives that you're highlighting, Josh, which I think should be like, you know, the right way to think about it, right? There's less money to acquire. But I think it's a boost to a disease area or a category where I think people want to invest more, hoping that there'll be a future target.\n\n00:45:51,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I don't know.\n\n00:45:53,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't want to say I'm optimistic, but I do think that the more of these headwinds that get behind us, I think the better off people are going to feel more comfortable. At the end of the day, you guys know this better than I do. The public valuations have to be healthy. And that has the trickle-down effect. And until we see IPOs and healthy valuations and public biotechs. I think it's really hard to climb up that mountain.\n\n00:46:22,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Josh, let me just add one other thing. One of the things that's not included in this calculation is all these big, big licensing deals too. Bristol BioNTech, Pfizer 3S. And so I'm going to do that analysis with our data in the next few days. So there's a lot of all that money too. And, you know. Clearly, somebody thinks something's going on with Summit because the share price has been jumping up for for no apparent reason. People have been trying to find reasons. Was it something happened to the Chinese label for Akisa's drug? And which of course, nothing happened. Um, so um. There's all that coming, and let's see how much money they've been pouring into biotechs that way. Hopefully, we can talk about it next week.\n\n00:47:07,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think with Summit, it was the expectations for a deal with AstraZeneca.\n\n00:47:12,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, but I said yesterday, you're wrong. Yesterday was up 16%. It was the day before. And yeah, and of course, nothing happened. But I mean, look, let's see, maybe Monday.\n\n00:47:24,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n If I had a nickel for every time I was optimistic for the outlook of biotech and was proven wrong, I would at least have a dollar or so.\n\n00:47:33,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n I will, I'll send you, I'll send you ten dollars.\n\n00:47:36,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n I remain hopefully optimistic, but also realistic, given the track record of the XBI over pretty much the last 10 years. And a reminder of where we started, right? Is the sector just too volatile and complex? To really attract generalists, and can it work if you don't get generalists, and is there ever going to be enough M &A to lift the XBI? At the end of the day, that sets it up for great potential stock picking. You just have to be an excellent and sometimes lucky stock picker. Move on to some data updates. We've got a data update from Diametica for treatment of preeclampsia for their protein therapeutic.","char_start":43147,"char_end":47463,"start_time":"00:44:20","end_time":null}

We've got a data update from Diametica for treatment of preeclampsia for their protein therapeutic.\n\n00:48:21,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n It showed notable reduction in blood pressure and dilation of the uterine artery. Um of pregnant women, um I don't think we've ever seen a data update in pre-eclampsia, you know, significant unmet medical need. And, you know, for a number of reasons, it can be very very difficult to develop. There were PUDICs for pregnant women, but it looked like a good start for the Diomedica team and will be an interesting program to follow in part because there is such limited innovation for anything that may affect pregnant women. There's another private company, Comanche Therapeutics, that also has a very interesting approach. They've been a little bit quiet.\n\n00:49:09,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n As of late, I'm not sure if that just reflects some of the challenges that there can be when it comes to enrolling patients with pre-eclampsia or really any pregnant women. As you can understand, that's a time when you know, you really, parents want to do, prospective parents want to do anything and everything they can to make sure that their baby is healthy. And sometimes.\n\n00:49:32,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n The idea of something novel or experimental can lead to recruitment challenges, but nonetheless, Diomedica has been able to enroll their trial thus far. Sam, let's go on to the lung cancer survey.\n\n00:49:50,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh, yeah. So, look, we did the lung cancer survey with endless questions, mostly for our own model building and education. But in there, we squeezed a couple of questions about what trials that are ongoing in lung cancer do you find.\n\n00:50:08,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n Do physicians find, this was a US survey, 53 physicians, do you find, do you expect to be practice changing in the upcoming period? So, of course, Summits, PD-1, VEGF was there.\n\n00:50:22,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n AstraZeneca's dropped to Avanza trial, which everyone's focused on, won the most anticipated in terms of being practice changing. So 49% of respondents said they expected that. But surprisingly, another one crept in there, which kind of got me a little bit intrigued. And that was Bristol-Myers Relativity. You remember, this is Relatlimab, got there in the end, plus Opdivo in a combination. This is not the fixed dose combination in lung cancer. Now, But we know that there's been quite a few of these hoped for— Tidget, for instance, Tim Three, for instance, others.\n\n00:51:07,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n combos of trying to extend the response rates of survival or progression-free survival of PD-1 treated patients.\n\n00:51:17,779 [SPEAKER_3]\n And the promise hasn't come through yet. And we all know everyone's thing was PD-1 and PD-1 it. So I was a bit surprised that that turned up as I hoped for a trial to read out, which of course also fits in with, we put that note out on Monday, that also fits in with. Perhaps some of the excitement around 81 Vega for Summit that was at around 40% of percent of positions say they expect to be Practice changing. Interestingly, BioNTech's BNT327 trial in non-small cell lung cancer didn't. This was only in non-small cell lung cancer. didn't score very highly, but I think that's because currently it's only not like five or six or seven US centers.\n\n00:52:04,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n Familiarity is an issue.\n\n00:52:07,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm hoping and I'm pretty sure that they'll try and expand that recruitment. But the Bristol RelatMap one was surprising. Maybe we need to make sure that we're ready for that data outcome whenever it comes.\n\n00:52:20,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Excellent. All right. We also got an important obesity update from Hungary and Calera. Ron Renaud, the CEO of Calera, who's, I think, one of the most successful former sell-side analysts around, and it looks like he may be on the verge of even surpassing all the successes he's had to date, pretty incredible track record, Sam, and I think you're going to talk about that.","char_start":47163,"char_end":51341,"start_time":"00:48:21","end_time":null}

So this is, um, the drug's called HRS 9531, it's developed by Hangry, and then licensed it. It's a very similar idea to Trezepatide or Zeppound from Lilly. GLP-1 and GIP agonists, once weekly, and they had phase 3 data in Chinese patients, which is pretty much in line with what we saw with Z-band in Chinese patients, both using the same um method of analyzing efficacy. So, 17. 7 weight loss, uh, with the um Hangry drug, and 17. 5 weight loss for the Zeppelin drug at about the same sort of time point, 48 weeks, 52 weeks. Similar type of baseline weights for the patients. What's interesting, though, is that the cholera hangry drug seems to be, the curve still seems to be continuing in terms of weight loss.\n\n00:53:48,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Whereas for the Z-bound trial in China, it kind of started plateauing at 44 weeks. So is that just a statistical randomness? Time will tell, at least in the phase two trials. So discontinuations were similar. side effect profile are supposed to be similar, so and they haven't even got to the highest doses there. The there's still an eight milligram dose that's being tested and we'll see where that goes. But very clearly, at the very least, similar to Zeppelin. But where is this going to go? How is it going to fit? Maybe somebody will need to partner with them, with Calera, that is, for the US. I don't know what their plans are.\n\n00:54:33,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I think they're cognizant of the massive capital requirements for for what they're planning on doing and at some point likely need that partner. You're on what were you going to say?\n\n00:54:43,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, let me make a couple of this. I'm spot on. Um. So recall, the GLIP1 to GIP ratio is slightly different here than Terzapatide, and that probably explained the higher potency. It's got a little bit more GLIP1 potency and a little bit less on the GIP. The adverse event profile is distinctly, you mentioned wisely, Sam, that it's low. I would say it's actually definitively looks better than Terzapatide across many studies.\n\n00:55:13,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n There is no plateau. And what's really remarkable, recall, is the FDA requires 52 weeks of dosing at the target dose. They're not even close to that. because it took about five or six months to dose escalate the way they're doing it. And so the efficacy here should continue to get better with time. And Sam, to your point, I think they're even going to go. High there's an eight-mig [sic] they're going to go even higher than that in their phase three. Um, I think they're going to start, you know, they're saying soon it's potentially by year end is our our view they're 45 patient kind of phase three program. They're well capitalized. They'll, to your point, they'll probably need more capital. That's just a generic statement for anybody running a study like that. But the drug is looking pretty good.\n\n00:55:55,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n Again, another sign of great innovation coming out of China, too. And kudos that this is the Bain Deal with Uh, with Atlas, uh, to spin this out. Great management team, Scott Wasserman, developed Ripatha, developed the Vanity at Engine. This is really um, had a commercial uh, you know, ran ops, run commercial ops. Literally, this is an A-star study team. Here, I think they should do great.\n\n00:56:18,710 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, amazing. They're a cumulative track record to think that that is going to get even better. Pretty amazing.\n\n00:56:26,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, do you want to close this out? We'll talk about some of the earnings. J &J seemed very strong. Pharma, not so strong.

Maybe MedTech and then Novartis, which was a little bit more mixed.\n\n00:56:38,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, so J &J, you know, they had a very good day on the results. And basically, when you look at the numbers and how they did in the first half. They're being very conservative about the second half. So there's plenty of room for more better performance. And of course, I think one of the things that people were worried about. It was the medical devices side, and that came through quite nicely. So it dropped the tariff impact from $400 million to $200 million.\n\n00:57:08,819 [SPEAKER_3]\n The questions were, of course, asked: what's going to happen with tariffs? And I don't know if, I can't remember if MFN was in there, but MFN probably was in the. Was in one of the two. And of course, there's no answers, right? Everybody's having constructive conversations with the administration. I bet you that if you did a LLM summary of all the results, that's what was going to come out. And we'll see what this rate of tariffs the administration is going to come out with, you know, low percentages.\n\n00:57:37,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Allow people a year to put a shovel in the ground and then say, 'Okay, we're starting manufacturing' and don't hit them with a tariff. Hopefully, that's what's going to happen. What was interesting with Novartis, which did the opposite, although they beat and also raised a little bit in operating profit guidance for the year was a little bit of worry about the Cosentix, which is their 12% of 2024 sales. So it's one of the biggest drugs for them. And they reduced the 20 to 5 sales forecast for that, which is not a good place to be when you've got a drug that's aiming to be a big drug, $ 8 billion peak sales.\n\n00:58:12,870 [SPEAKER_3]\n Before it hits 2029 patent expiry, at least on paper. So the question ends up now being, what is the growth rate from 2026 to 2019?\n\n00:58:24,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n And they also went in for a 10 billion dollar buyback. So Josh, I'm convinced they have enough money to go and keep doing M&A. So hopefully, you will see them as an M&A player going forward still, because they'll need it as they're going to hit into this patent experience.\n\n00:58:39,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I would note J&J's bravado up 30% quarter over quarter, and a big wave of psychedelics coming. Nice to see the traction with that problem. It took a while, didn't it? It took a while to get. Yes, it's reimbursement challenges that they didn't anticipate— that I think the rest of the field has taken note of. Now we're going to close out where we started. The other shoe that we were waiting to drop just dropped. Reuters noting that the FDA will request Sireptotherapeutics to voluntarily stop all shipments of Levitas. So not necessarily surprising after some of these updates.\n\n00:59:18,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n Looks like Srepta shares were halted for volatility, so. We closed where we opened. Thanks, everyone, for a great discussion. I think emphasis from Today's overview is integrity. You know, something that's so important in our industry and those who have it and deliver it, the folks like Josh and Justin at Amelix get tons of respect and credibility for doing so. So let's make sure that we do what Adam chided us to do more of at the start and make sure integrity is an important theme to our industry.","char_start":54808,"char_end":58380,"start_time":"00:56:26","end_time":null}

To the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. Brian, Sam, Paul. Welcome and congrats for surviving a little bit of a wild and wacky week. I guess the news of the week has to be, once again, the Sarepta drama. I know we covered Sarepta. Quite a bit of detail on last week's biotech hangout. It seems like it's a whole new can of worms again this week. So maybe, Brian, you can take it away and inform our listeners.\n\n00:00:48,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just what happened in this crazy situation of late.\n\n00:00:51,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's funny. I think I was listening to Biotech Hangout last week, and as interesting as the Sarepta news had been up to that point, I think the real sparks started flying just as Hangout was finishing up. So, you know, just to recap what happened last week, there were a couple of events and sequences that occurred. On Wednesday, Sarepta made a big announcement about a restructuring plan. You know, there had been two deaths on Alevitis, their gene therapy for DMD, that have occurred this year in the commercial experience, both of them in non-ambulatory patients. This was leading to concern about what the sales of Alevitus were going to be. There was definitely clear hesitation among physicians and parents to continue using. Although it was still, you know, they were still seeing demand. They were still seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of sales per quarter. There was concern that these safety events were sort of. Accelerating, they had—um— stopped shipping for non-ambulatory patients. We're continuing to ship for ambulatory patients.\n\n00:01:53,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, I know talking to investors, there was a lot of concern about— would they be able to meet a lot of the debt payments that many. Thank you.\n\n00:02:02,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n Over the next two years, some of the milestones to their partnerships.\n\n00:02:09,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n So they had this big call.\n\n00:02:13,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n Mission.\n\n00:02:16,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n Take a couple. The opposite.\n\n00:02:18,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n And providing sort of a floor opportunity.\n\n00:02:22,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n On 11 on that call um and the bib debate start on this on Friday.\n\n00:02:30,259 [SPEAKER_2]\n Because I'm sort of whether or not there were any. Safety events drop. The decision of the. The program is in limbo. Muscular dystrophy.\n\n00:02:39,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n Indications that they have been targeting and talking.\n\n00:02:43,380 [SPEAKER_4]\n We'll be right back.\n\n00:02:47,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n Solar indications, but potentially address the same elevators within DMD using the orange 74 vector with a protein to sort of reconstitute the missing protein diseases.\n\n00:03:01,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, sort of didn't provide a direct answer, but I think the assumption that you know they didn't announce anything was that there wasn't anything on board about it. And then, Thursday night, there was a death in one of the Girdle muscula.\n\n00:03:12,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n This is only.\n\n00:03:16,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n four patients who will end up returning.\n\n00:03:20,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Damage control. Conference call Friday morning. Um, you know, to explain that they did, you know, they didn't think that this was a material event. I know I was on the call and asked pretty starkly, you know, where their threshold for materiality is. And there's certainly a disagreement on the street and with Sarepta.\n\n00:03:40,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n Material update. And that's sort of where we left off. Out last week. And then that was finishing up. It started breaking that the FDA had now asked Sarepta to voluntarily stop shipping Levitas even to ambulatory patients. So essentially, stopping all shipments of Levitas to any DMV.\n\n00:04:00,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, they sort of work that. What was going to be here. Um, Friday. Thank you. Serapta said that they were refusing to follow this request for voluntary talk to the small shipments of Alavidus. Of course, a lot of people who would advise in this industry that want the FDA to voluntarily do something. It's not necessarily a request to voluntarily do something, but more or less a demand by Monday.","char_start":0,"char_end":4486,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Peter Marks is his predecessor's decision to approve it over the death of seemingly a lot of CBER staff. Um, you know what, and you know we put in order last week. We like to say, uh, um. In all these situations, and he's the person that, you know, I think we have to.\n\n00:06:00,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n What will he do? Because so far he's been fairly active in his role as CBER director, chief medical officer, chief scientific officer.\n\n00:06:09,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n The FDA, and we've seen a number of decisions come out of CBER.\n\n00:06:13,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Come on.\n\n00:06:16,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's a derelict flag.

Since he's been appointed. So I think there's a big question as to, okay, are we in a new regulatory state here where, you know, you're really looking for a hurdle on that 9% in his line for getting this drug? Which may be in some.\n\n00:06:45,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n You might as well— Room.\n\n00:06:49,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um.\n\n00:06:51,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n sector for a long time.\n\n00:06:53,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n This is really going to be politically possible. I mean, if the FDA is really setting up an insurmountable hurdle to get this drug back on the market, they're certainly going to receive it. A backlash from the DMD advocacy groups who are very vocal and very powerful. And, you know, to some extent, the DMD advocacy groups had kind of diminished enthusiasm for Sarepta. But there's something to be said about, you know, a regulatory agency saying, 'Hey, no, you cannot have this product anymore.' And even, you know, even if there's, you know, a few months. Physicians and parents and advocacy group members that risk, reward doesn't make sense. Sort of denying parents and physicians the options of choice here when Thank you.\n\n00:07:38,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n Thank you.\n\n00:07:41,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n Brian, your connection's going in and out just a little bit.

Love to hear where your head is.\n\n00:08:13,840 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, look, I mean, Eric, I think quite a few of us around this conversation— I don't know the detail— but our parents. So first of all, I have to say, as I tweeted earlier this week, my heart goes to any parent who had this hope and now is facing potentially not having the hope. But let's get back to what the situation is. From a regulatory perspective, the job of the FDA is to approve drugs with proven efficacy, and a risk-benefit profile that favors the approval. When we went through this approval, I remember so well, and I did tweet over the episode where Brad and then a couple of you guys were on, where we discussed this when the FDA first expanded the approval to include a variety of children where the data was perhaps a little bit more sketchy. And the drug was approved on the back of perhaps not the most strong of efficacy signals.\n\n00:09:20,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n So we've all had our conversations about that. And that was something that we worried about. And it did give us all a memory or a recall of what happened with the Alzheimer's drugs, although there you're not dealing with very young children, which is even more emotive, I suppose. But. At the end of the day, from a harsh regulatory perspective, it is their job.\n\n00:09:48,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n To decide whether a product should be marketed with the efficacy that we know about and the side effect profile. Now, if it can be proven that the side effect issues are entirely in non-ambulatory patients, which seems to be the case. I mean, this is not an ordinary side effect, right? This is a grade five. These are deaths which are.\n\n00:10:14,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n So maybe there is a way that they could keep the product on the market. But I think this is going to be, as Brian very clearly said, a political hot potato. What's the right thing to do here is very, very tough. And you do always come back to, if there's absolutely no choice, should the parents not be given the choice of making that decision for their offspring if it doesn't affect anybody else at all? It's very hard. I really can't put myself in their shoes and make this decision for the parents or the regulator, to be honest.\n\n00:10:50,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, what are your learnings from this mess of a situation?\n\n00:10:55,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um. I mean, I actually feel like you and I think in other topics today.\n\n00:11:02,729 [SPEAKER_1]\n I may be, and others may be more critical of the FDA. I mean, I give them some credit here. I mean, they acted.\n\n00:11:09,630 [SPEAKER_1]\n Relatively quickly, right? I mean, we've, you know, there's been reporting around Sirepta and, uh, just referring to the stat reporting, and, you know, have they been sharing all the side effect data with the FDA? I mean, I think the FDA Look, we can look back at what Prasad had said about disapproval from the beginning and kind of debate whether there have been biases here. But they, I mean, they acted quickly when there was a severe safety issue and they might not be getting all the safety information, right? I mean, this all happened really, really quickly.

But I mean, I guess the way I've always sort of seen it is like, you know, and again, this is my bias. I've always felt like, from the perspective of covering many other rare disease companies, I've always felt like Sarepta has benefited from a confusingly lower regulatory standard dating back to the Exxon Skippers, right? And then not. You know, ultimately not doing confirmatory work there. And so, you know, I mean, I think hindsight's obviously hindsight's 2020, but I think ultimately, like I, I don't. Feel like this whole saga is informing my view on how I'm looking at other biotech companies in the space. Like, I do think that there is this nuance going on. In gene therapy, where we're seeing a lot of companies get breakthroughs or, you know, these accelerated paths forward. But then some of the recent regulatory headlines, as Scorny was alluding to, have maybe been more negative and less flexible on the margin. But I view this, I've always viewed, kind of the Sarepta plight as like a little bit of an outlier in the context of the rare disease space.\n\n00:12:52,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so, thinking about it from the investment view, I just kind of don't really know even how I would extrapolate this in anything else. And, you know, it's a really tough decision and I totally understand the patient side, but. I can definitely understand the FDA's perspective here and again, I commend them for moving quickly.\n\n00:13:10,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let me just pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the communication channels here that the FDA has used to kind of disseminate its views.\n\n00:13:20,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think you're right that they're— miscommunication through the media, through the great reporting at both Stat News and endpoints and other channels. I mean, it is certainly unorthodox.\n\n00:13:31,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Probably not ideal. Uh, and initially, I guess I was quite critical of this quote senior FDA official who seems to be spilling the beans to the media before, say, addressing patients or their families—those who are most important— even before investors. We like to think we're important, but we're less important. The patients and their families. And I hope, honestly, that this communication channel is cleaned up and it doesn't continue.\n\n00:13:58,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n On the other hand, the more I think about it, I kind of understand the FDA has been a difficult place, right? It did go to the company, and ask for the drug. Shipments to be paused and was refused, and clearly the communication between Sarepta and the FDA has broken down. That might be another whole topic of discussion— why it's broken down and who's to fault. And as Brian mentioned, it's pretty unusual for a company to refuse to do something that the FDA requests.\n\n00:14:27,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Having put in that situation, it may be that the FDA had no other choice. It wanted the drug off the market. Essentially, it had to use. court of public opinion to force that and maybe the most expeditious way of getting what it wanted. was to go to the media. So, you know, this is starting to kind of all make sense now from a communications pattern standpoint. But I have to say, I don't think it's ideal. It is a very, very messy situation for all involved.","char_start":11217,"char_end":14986,"start_time":"00:11:45","end_time":null}

It is a very, very messy situation for all involved.\n\n00:14:56,060 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, I think you're right. I hope it's contained, right? I mean, the worry here is that this further puts generalist investors off from our sector. It's pretty rare that we see a company that was going to have a four or five billion dollar top line, now, weeks later, become potential bankruptcy risk. So that is stark and unfortunate for everyone involved, including the investors. And it really puts a pin on just how much risk is involved with our sector, even for those companies who seemingly, you know, have it made. But Brian, you're closest to this situation. I think you got the last word on Sarepta. I love this. How do you? Do you think this should or will play out? Do you think the drug will ever make it back?\n\n00:15:45,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think the whole situation is really. Frankly, tragic. And I don't actually, you know, I understood why Exondus was approved. I understood why Elevitus was approved. I was a regulator. Probably wouldn't have been.\n\n00:16:03,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n myself.\n\n00:16:04,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think one of the issues with approving drugs.\n\n00:16:07,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, low levels. As you get into the situation where you know, removing things from market is a horrible, horrible decision to do. And, you know, you read these anecdotes from. From, you know, parents who have kids who have been treated with the drug and they think it's enormously effective. Parents who have been trying to schedule their kid to get this drug and now don't have that. It's really a horrific thing to go through. Whether it gets on the market again or not, I almost think it's going to be a political decision.\n\n00:16:40,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n Again, Vinay, who is a very stringent regulator. I mean, and I think this goes way beyond just Sorekta, man. And I think the world of Vinay, I think he's one of the smartest people I've ever met. I've learned a lot from his analysis, but he is a much more stringent regulator than a lot of us.\n\n00:16:57,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n And when you read what he says and the way he views clinical trials, it's certainly a higher hurdle if he is the primary decision maker at the FDA. But I also think, you know, he is.\n\n00:17:11,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n pushing on something that I think he may regret. opening up and and you know there is going to be a i think there's going to be a battle here and it's and it's going to be one of public opinion it's going to be messy i mean i just think about when a vast failed in breast cancer and the drug was pulled. I mean, it was, you know, despite the evidence, you know, it was a very, very tough battle. And even McKenna, which was really not, didn't have advocacy group support the way that D &D treatments do. But again, it was a big fight. So what the fate is, I think, has yet to be written.\n\n00:17:45,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, well, certainly not the last time we'll be talking about Sarepta on Biotech Hangout. And Brian, you already alluded to another topic of discussion, which is Dr. Prasad's rigor in terms of new drug approvals. We'll speak about the situation and circumstance with reprimand's RP1 for melanoma in a bit. But before we get there, the other FDA topic of discussion this week has to be the new CDER director, Dr. George Tidmarsh.\n\n00:18:12,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, do you want to introduce this concept?","char_start":14686,"char_end":18334,"start_time":"00:14:56","end_time":null}

I mean, I'm sure that the others had interactions with industry, perhaps advised some industry. I don't know exactly, but certainly here we have somebody who is a veteran, if you want to use that phrase, not meaning old, but meaning somebody who's got experience. Four companies from what I counted, La Jolla, Horizon, Coulter, Threshold Pharmaceuticals. um in different um different times and various types of products that brought to market. And so he's replacing Jacqueline Kerrigan-Curry, who was in a position, who actually resigned or announced her retirement last month.\n\n00:19:23,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, And it's one of the obviously one of the top positions to be in.\n\n00:19:28,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n And this is after, you know, Corrigan-Currie was in charge as acting theatre director since January after Patricia Cavazzoni stepped down.\n\n00:19:40,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I see that as a positive, as somebody who's actually been in the industry, understands what this takes for certainly swans. Companies to get drugs to a point where it gets to the regulator. I would say also that he's in many respects of the same mind as Prasad and Makary. Makary, I always get that wrong. Um. In terms of the way that they think about things and the ideologies they've had, the policies that they thought were wrong previously, for instance, with the COVID-19 pandemic. Et cetera. So those are things that I think are relevant. And I think it could be interesting to see what happens when we come to discuss direct-to-consumer advertising, drug advertising, prescription drug advertising, et cetera. So what would be good to see is that CEDAR and CBER are getting some kind of alignment.\n\n00:20:41,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because one of the problems with the FDA, and I think folks are going to talk about this now, is that it wasn't immediately obvious that the two branches or two divisions actually thought the same. When it came to drug approval, some had lower standards or lower bar. Let's put it that way, so not lower standards, lower bar. And others were really holding drug companies to account for everything that they could possibly do.\n\n00:21:08,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n That's the way I see it. I'd love to hear others.\n\n00:21:12,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I think you summed it up well, Sam. On the one hand, Dr. Tidmarsh is coming from a very industry-centered background. He's run biotech companies. He's founded biotech companies. He knows the industry and he knows investors.\n\n00:21:27,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's gotta be a positive. He'll be the first of these for HHS leaders.\n\n00:21:34,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Bhattacharya, Macari, Prasad to have really spent time in. in our industry, which has to be a positive. You know, as you've also laid out on the other hand, he's kind of coming to it from the same perspective that those outsiders have in terms of being very critical of the agency. I mean, I think he actually met Dr. Macari at Dr. Bhattacharya's Anti-COVID. conference at which point you know these these academics were criticizing uh the the administration the prior administration establishments criticisms of or criticizing the prior establishment for having stifled scientific discourse right so that's kind of how they all got their jobs they were all outsiders\n\n00:22:22,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n Looking in.\n\n00:22:24,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n Bye. critical of the censorship of free speech.\n\n00:22:28,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it's going to be really interesting to me now that they're insiders, now that they are the establishment.","char_start":18034,"char_end":22219,"start_time":"00:18:12","end_time":null}

We just talked about it. situation where um around the surreptitious drama. There hasn't been a lot of transparency from either side. Um, it isn't necessarily easy to become the establishment and then still embrace those ideals such as transparency, debate, openness, etc., when you're running a large organization like the FDA. So I'm really curious to see how. You know, not just Dr. Tidmarsh, but also Macquarie and Prasad, continue to um adjust their ways as they've already have done for sure, but will need to do in the future if they want to maintain control and operation over such a large established group of scientists and review staff.\n\n00:23:31,910 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, Brian, what do you guys want to add on this?\n\n00:23:35,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, you know, one of the things I just like to talk about, you know, I talk about with clients is just sort of like the. Odd bed of fellows that seem to have been made through.\n\n00:23:46,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n disagreements on COVID, right? And, you know, what's really striking is, like you said, you know, we sort of see this uniformity from Trump, Tarofke, Jr., Macari, Prasad, Ted Marsh, Pat Acharya, and all.\n\n00:23:59,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n being very critical of sort of the COVID mandates and the way that the prior administration handled.\n\n00:24:04,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n the pandemic and not to understate the societal impact that COVID had on, you know, the entire world is really tremendous. But when you kind of get beyond COVID, there's not that much uniformity in sort of world health care view among a lot of these guys. Right. And, you know, I kind of mentioned this in the. about than I. But Ray, you already see, and one of the things I thought was interesting on Monday, you saw Laura Loomer going all out to kind of criticize Prasad's.\n\n00:24:35,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n And, you know, I mean, again, he does seem like a very odd choice to have, you know, being this much of an activist role as a CBER CMO. CSO appointee to FDA when you hear sort of tonally GOP and Trump being very pro-flexibility. And even, you know, Macari saying things like, 'Oh, if we just have, you know, biological plausibility, we can approve things on that.' Right. I mean, that that is the essence of how, like, an elevatist would get approved. Right. Biological plausibility. You show it in rats and you can approve. Macari sort of made those statements about ultra orphan drugs. But it's very dichotomous with, with a lot of sort of the. framework of clinical design and the approach to regulatory that I think. Bye. You know, very clear about, you know, who's going to be your career. You know, if you read Ending Medical Reversal and all of that. Who's It does seem at odds. And I just wonder. How long?\n\n00:25:34,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n How those can play nicely.\n\n00:25:37,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. And, you know, I think I think, from my perspective, like we're still really figuring out, like who this FDA like actually is, you know, and I think that there's been a lot of paradoxes so far, from my perspective, right? Like on the one hand, what you just alluded to, Scorny, McCary's commentary on biological plausibility. I mean, that sounds like Peter Marks 3. 0, right? From the perspective of flexibility and industry friendliness and gene therapy, right? And we've seen a lot of companies in this rare space continue to get these regulatory agreements that you know, look very, very favorable, like small, pivotal, open-label trials and things like that. On the other hand, you have this whole piece with Prasad, right, with just all the past commentary he's had and then some of the recent things like. What happened with that? What was that DMD cell therapy for the cardiac component and then also the CRL last week? You know, I think the other thing too, Eric, that you were saying about.","char_start":21919,"char_end":26175,"start_time":"00:22:22","end_time":null}

You know, I think the other thing too, Eric, that you were saying about.\n\n00:26:34,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n just this concept of transparency and discourse. I mean, Maybe I can hit it quickly now because you don't have to spend a ton of time on it. But like, you know, there was this panel this week around antidepressant use in pregnancy. Right. And like. Yeah, I think it's a really, you know, I cover a lot of stuff in psychiatry and my background before being on Wall Street was in neuroscience. So, like, I think a lot of these questions are really, really interesting. And I think it's a really It's like a laudable goal to question, you know, certain medical decisions that are made by default without great clinical data, right? There haven't been like incredible randomized controlled trials of antidepressants in women who are pregnant because those studies have like ethical issues, right? So I think, like, you know, holding an open discussion to kind of talk about risk benefit sounds very, very interesting in a vacuum. But then, when you look at that discussion and how it played out, I mean, you have a lot of people or at least a number of people on that panel who have a reputation for being against antidepressants in general. And, you know, again, I point people again to the stat article this morning. I mean, some of the quotes from that are just wild, right?\n\n00:27:35,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n When I think about just the depiction of mental health. And so I guess, when I sort of take a step back, it's like, was that an open discussion or was that a discussion geared around? Seemingly, a preset conclusion to just question the orthodoxy. And so, you know, I guess that's my long-winded way of saying, you know, I was talking about this with one of my colleagues internally today, like, I still feel like we're really figuring out who this FDA actually is and we think about stocks and we think about drug approvals, like I think my FDA meter on just kind of the degree of flexibility and the degree to which this will look like the old administration versus the new one. I i feel like it's changing every every week, you know, I mean, I guess now I'm leaning maybe a little bit more cautious, right, but still feeling like there's going to be flexibility. But it's hard. Like, I think we've got a lot of countervailing points of evidence right now on kind of who these guys are and who their governing philosophy is going to be going forward. Do you guys agree?\n\n00:28:33,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I do, and I'm going to come back to something Brian mentioned when he was talking about the surreptitious circumstances. How some of these decisions increasingly are coming down to a single person, a single leader, either Uh, Dr. Prasad or Dr. McCurry— we presume, or maybe you know someone who reports directly to them. We don't know, but But they're not seemingly being made with the rank and file constituents, the review staff at the FDA. And there was another report out this morning on how. Those rank and file review staff are increasingly heading for the exits. So, so maybe the decisions are being made out of necessity by individuals at higher up functions, or maybe you know, the fact that the senior leadership team is willing to overturn so many different decisions by the rank and file. is causing that exodus of talent. I don't know, but it's another trend and one that I'm very mindful of. I think one that we're about to talk about as we segue into what happened with Reptile Moon. So, maybe we should. Go right there and then, and come back to others'\n\n00:29:35,510 [SPEAKER_3]\n thoughts on the functionality of the FDA. For those of you who are not aware, Reclamune got a complete response letter, a CRL, earlier in the week. As a drug called RP1 for refractory melanoma. Unfortunately, there are no good therapies for second-line plus. Melanoma patients, response rates for the standard of care, somewhere in the single-digit range.\n\n00:29:57,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n The data that RepliMune was able to provide in support of their BLA was fairly good. It had a response rate, the drug has a response rate in the low 30s. Durability of response that's actually quite prolonged. It's an immunotherapy.","char_start":25875,"char_end":30324,"start_time":"00:26:34","end_time":null}

It's an immunotherapy.\n\n00:30:12,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n It does benefit from long-term tumor control. What the drug did not have was a randomized controlled study. That was well known now for many, many months that they were going to try and get approval from a single arm study. As we all know, that's not something that Dr. Prasad has been in favor of either in his written work previous to coming to the FDA or even some of his quotes through his FDA leadership.\n\n00:30:40,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n Through his listening tour, we did get a sense of that flexibility that you were mentioning, Paul, that he might be more willing to accommodate industry in cases where there was much unmet need and plausibility of mechanism, and also certainly some evidence of activity, all of which RP1 had. The company really, I think, was expecting to get approval. Certainly, they were acting in ways that would have you believe. They thought they were going to get approval. Their mid-cycle and late-cycle review meetings went well. They had breakthrough designation for this drug. And they were all teed up to announce what we thought would be good news this week. But unfortunately, that CRL threw them for a spin. And it does seem like in this case, it was some higher up at the agency. We presume Dr. Prasad, who made the call here. Not to approve the drug, saying that a single arm study was not adequate to support approval in oncology, despite you know, the unmet need here.\n\n00:31:40,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I've got many thoughts on this, but I'll pass it on to others. Maybe, Sam, you want to speak. I know you follow oncology very carefully as well. And tell us how you think this should have played out.\n\n00:31:52,410 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so look, when you look at the data, First, they had accelerated approval.\n\n00:31:59,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n Designation so that is that is usually a helps you get through the process, even though you've got a single arm study. When you look at the data, overall response rate, as you rightly say, in the 30% range, it did deteriorate a little bit from one readout to the next, but still above the 30-odd percent. Pretty decent complete response rates. Half of that, basically half of that.\n\n00:32:28,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n ORR was from Complete Responses, which is great. It's an off-the-shelf product. A bunch of patients had stable disease. And you rightly say this is a group of patients that don't have a lot. Um, but what happened in the intervening period is that antagonism was approved. Now that's not an off-the-shelf product.\n\n00:32:48,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n It doesn't have the same rate of CRs, although this is not a head-to-head comparison.\n\n00:32:53,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n There are lots of reasons why you would be very careful in making these kind of comparisons, but that's just what we have to do. But yet it was approved. So to a degree, you could say, 'I mean, in FDA's defense, that the standard of care changed a little bit.' But in reality, again, oncologists are not. It's the same story as Blenrep. And I'm sure we can talk about that again, because last week we thought he might get a CRN and he didn't. That's a multiple myeloma drug. Oncologists are.\n\n00:33:23,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n Good at dealing with these situations.\n\n00:33:26,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n You give them a product, they find the right patients to treat with it, which is why it's so hard sometimes to model an oncology product in these kind of relatively niche settings. So, you know, if it was me. I think I would have, the opposite of what Brian said about Sireptin and all of this, I would have probably approved it and let the physicians decide how to use it.

Again, Dr. Prasad knows.\n\n00:33:53,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n How discerning oncologists are. Um, maybe the worry was that it would be in the community, there would be a bit more or less discerning, but I'm not sure these patients end up in the community at the stage that they arrive at. That's what my thought process is. So it's unfortunate. And I don't think it's got to read through to anything else. On the bottom line, it's possible that the FDA can say, look, standard of care has changed. You should have had a control arm. We know that Opdivo is active generally, or checkpoint inhibitors are very active in melanoma. You should have had a control arm. But they could have told them that a year ago.\n\n00:34:38,199 [SPEAKER_4]\n Over. Just in case. Sorry.\n\n00:34:40,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, no, I think you're right, Sam. I think it is that kind of last-minute change in tone, that arbitrary nature, maybe that singular individual driving the change.\n\n00:34:50,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Is potentially so disruptive to a company like The unfortunate thing here is that they don't have the resources to do a randomized controlled trial. They are unable to successfully lobby for accelerated approval, which I assume they will not be able to succeed in doing. This drug's never coming to market. It's going to die. Think if you had taken this product to KOL's. They would have supported the efficacy here. Obviously, it is an imperfect study, but. But most of the opinion leaders that we've spoken to believe the drug does work. And should be offered to their patients who don't have other choices. So it's a little surprising to me the way this played out from a decision-making standpoint.\n\n00:35:35,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n We never went to panel. We didn't get the opportunity for KOLs to weigh in. And provide their expertise, which I would have liked to have heard. Brian, Paul, any thoughts again on? on the nature of this decision-making.\n\n00:35:49,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n To me, it's just like.\n\n00:35:51,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n We're still figuring out what the deal is, for lack of a better way to say it. I keep having companies tell me over and over, nothing has changed.\n\n00:36:00,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n This or that agreement that is appears bullish at face value. And I'm not saying I don't, you know, don't believe what certain companies are saying that they got in writing from the FDA but, like, I'm. I'm very, very interested in how the rest of this year unfolds when we see a number of these other products that are kind of coming to the FDA.\n\n00:36:18,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n With some element of flexibility required for approval, I mean, I think we need to see, for lack of a better word, some wins in this kind of arena to, again, help us stay comfortable that, for small biotech, the FDA is as open for business as a lot of investors hope they are.\n\n00:36:41,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n Go ahead, Brian.\n\n00:36:48,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n Brian, we can't hear you.\n\n00:36:56,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay, hopefully we'll get Brian. Pack somehow. Can you guys hear me?\n\n00:37:02,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, I can hear you. Okay. All right. There you are, Brian. Go ahead.\n\n00:37:08,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think we need to all chip in and buy Brian a new phone.\n\n00:37:13,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, we'll see if he's able to come back in. But Paul, I agree. It's very well said. It seems like almost that. Anything that was agreed to in the past needs to be. Re-agreed to today under the new administration and leadership of the FDA.\n\n00:37:31,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n And there's going to be. You know, the risk of surprises going forward, the risk of uncertainty for sure.\n\n00:37:38,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n And we all know that investors hate that. So when it comes down to increased uncertainty in our industry, that means increased cost of capital.\n\n00:37:47,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n And that means something that's not directionally where we want to be for stock price movements. So we can hope for the best.\n\n00:37:54,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n But we need to see better clarity and transparency.\n\n00:37:58,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Eric, one of the topics we talked about earlier was what does this mean for investors?

It creates uncertainty, etc. But when I look at one particular story that's running with a single arm.\n\n00:38:09,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n Trial, and that's our SELEX. Actually, that stock price has been fine. It didn't suddenly seem to be a massive decision by investors that anybody with a single-arm study is not going to make it. And you have to admit, in that particular case, There is a standard of care, or that has changed, is Carvicti. So. There are other agents here, but But do you have a drug that potentially has a better scientific profile? Potentially, right? I know this is contested. I know there's a lot of moving parts there. Um, so perhaps investors don't just jump to a final conclusion after such events every time, which is hopefully healthy to see.\n\n00:38:53,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I know you want to talk about blend rep as well, speaking of myeloma, Sam. So maybe that's a good time to just mention what happened there.\n\n00:39:00,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Very quickly. So basically, they had a pretty, what I would call a bruising outcome last week. Was it last week? I can't remember now. There's so much that happens in it. short period of time and and the uh the uh adcom uh odak basically voted against uh the approval.\n\n00:39:21,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n And it was a pretty clear vote, right? It wasn't like a four to five or three to four. You know, for one of the trials, it was seven to one. So the vote was very clear. And what is interesting is that it would have been an obvious thing for the FDA to do— is to give them a CRL. Which they didn't. They've extended the PDUFA. We have looked at a whole bunch of other data sets that the company has that does show an opportunity to come back, perhaps. With a modified dosing request to the regulator, maybe 1. 9 milligrams, et cetera. But just to summarize, the issues they had was— they said, 'The side effect profile at the dose that you're talking about, especially the eye side effect profiles, we don't like that. And there was also this talk about why did you only have 5% of your— patients in the US.' Now, I don't think the company can deal with that in three months, but they could certainly go back and talk about lower doses, longer times. Between dosing from other trials that they've had, such as Dream14, et cetera, with the regulator.\n\n00:40:27,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n Again, the multiple myeloma community has endless numbers of drugs that they deal with. They have so many options and they have so many permutations they have to choose from. They know and they deal with. Seriously toxic agents in some of the older drugs that they were dealing with. Now we're a little bit better off. They know how to manage this. I think they should allow it. And what's interesting, of course, is that a whole host of other countries have approved it since, the latest one being the European Union.\n\n00:40:56,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Let's see if that happens. Maybe Prasad here with his hematology hat on has been the opposite influence that we think he might have been on some of the other discussions. So fingers crossed, this is a drug that I think needs to be out there for the types of patients who can't access or can't take some of the other agents.\n\n00:41:16,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well said. Paul, we also had another FDA decision in your neck of the woods, GH Research and their clinical hold.\n\n00:41:23,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n More garden variety, or is there some read-through to the FDA environment from this news?\n\n00:41:29,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n This was really weird.\n\n00:41:31,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n There might be some other read-through. I think, like.\n\n00:41:35,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n As an analyst in the situation, there's There's such a level of like informational asymmetry, right? Like it's not.

I haven't looked at meeting minutes or correspondence, and so it's hard.\n\n00:41:46,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n to opine with any level of like 100 conviction but you know, essentially these guys and have so far been unable to get their product off clinical hold. And the context here is it's an inhaled formulation of DMT, a psychedelic for treatment-resistant depression. They have phase two data from a decently sized randomized controlled trial in Europe with an unprecedentedly large effect size. Certainly there's a debate on how big will the effect size be in phase three. Will that totally hold up? But regardless, the data look very, very good. The safety profile was considerably better than expected.\n\n00:42:25,089 [SPEAKER_1]\n And there's been a decent amount of phase one work, too. So there's actually a pretty good human safety database here. This was put on hold in the U. S. and they ended up [in development in Europe and the UK]. And the FDA, I think it's almost a couple of years ago now, essentially had issues with a rat finding. That was a laryngeal toxicity finding, and they wanted the company to essentially show and justify that this is a rat-specific issue. And so, the company, at the FDA's request, re-ran a rat model and also ran a dog model— the mammalian model— essentially showing that this didn't appear in dogs. There's also this meta-analysis of inhaled drugs that shows that this finding is not uncommon in rats.\n\n00:43:10,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n But for most drugs, the majority of the time, it's a rat-specific issue. So there's good justification here. It looks like they did what the FDA asked, and they have human clinical data. So, you know, the FDA essentially asked them to provide further on why they believe it's a rat-specific issue or something else, right? And what that something else would be is TBD. I think our view is that it's just based on the fact pattern, everything we know, it's almost hard to believe that. You know, maybe one more correspondence will get this off hold. Like maybe it was something where they were responding to a number of FDA questions and. It wasn't just going to be waving a magic wand, but it's a little bit confusing, right? I mean, you can speculate in a whole number of ways, right, related to, you know, is there a bandwidth thing? Are teams within the FDA talking to each other, right? Is the non-clinical team? Communicating with the clinical folks who've looked at the clinical data, because the clinical data don't show any respiratory issue, and the company even did spirometry in their phase two study, which is you know, kind of going above and beyond.\n\n00:44:14,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n So it's a little bit confusing. I mean, I think, again, extrapolation here is TBD. But this agency, if we think about some of the actual underlying themes within this IND, I mean, this agency. Is I think geared up to potentially be you know bullish for the psychedelic space right and more accommodating there and they're also talking about right not wanting companies to to do clinical work ex-US just because they think they have to, right? And already predominant of the clinical work here has been done in Europe. So it's surprising for all of those reasons. I mean, I still feel like the- fact pattern suggests this should get resolved in the near term. But I also feel a little silly. What else can they really say to the FDA? And I think that's the thing investors are grappling with. Do we even really know what else the FDA needs to hear given the case that's been presented so far?\n\n00:45:05,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n All right, more mixed signals from the agency. I'm getting kind of wrapped around the axle myself just thinking about all this stuff. Let's leave the FDA if we can. And move on to some of the clinical news for the week. One of the better readouts, Paul, I guess, was the Alkermes orexin data.

Let's leave the FDA if we can. And move on to some of the clinical news for the week. One of the better readouts, Paul, I guess, was the Alkermes orexin data. So, would you like to tell us what we learned there?\n\n00:45:26,150 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, sure. Better readout, I agree, although the stock sold off. And I think that's more about kind of the market and tactical trading versus the drug itself. Orexins are a class of drugs for wakefulness promoting in the narcolepsy space and potentially other indications as well. This Alkermes trial was in narcolepsy type 1, and the data were positive, and the full data are going to be presented in September. WorldSleep, the stock, sold off. And I do think that ultimately kind of gets at sort of what the setup is here for this class and what investors take for granted and what they don't take for granted. It was widely expected that this drug would work in narcolepsy type. That's because the phase one data there was great. Tocatus had multiple positive trials there, and the biological rationale is very strong. So in that press release, we know the drug hit on almost all the clinical endpoints except for one in a study that really wasn't even that well-powered, so strong data. But the controversy here relates to safety.\n\n00:46:23,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n Algernes, in their phase one study, has seen a few cases of quote-unquote mild visual disturbances. Which largely have been described as like light sensitivity. A few other companies have reported these as well. And I think, as we get more data for this class, everyone's kind of trying to figure out what this is. Is this this benign, modest kind of overstimulation issue, right, that is self-resolving? Or is it a harbinger of something that is more severe? Our view. From digging through certain FDA regulatory stuff for CNS drugs, like the requirements for doing driving studies, looking at other drug labels and labels around kind of monitoring and driving stuff, because I think that's really the main question here, is suggestive that if this remains a mild issue for these drugs, it should be of no real clinical or regulatory consequence. You can see a number of stimulants have this kind of issue, migraine drugs, antiepileptics, even some antidepressants. And so we've been bullish on the stock and we've also been kind of just bullish on the category, that in the grand scheme of the standard of care in this space, which is oxidates, right, the safety profile of orexins looks very, very differentiated.\n\n00:47:30,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n But Alchemy's indiscretion release didn't really give us any color on this piece and sort of said, 'Wait for the full data, for the full safety update.' And I think opacity is often discounted even more than a mildly negative reality when it comes to stocks. And so thanks to the sell-off, and hence now we'll wait for world sleep and see what they show us.\n\n00:47:48,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great summary. I don't think we have to wait too long, Tom, right? The date will come out in September. So a little patience may be virtue here.\n\n00:47:56,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, the other big news we had from a clinical standpoint was Abivax, ABVX is the ticker. I don't cover the name, but. A big win in the INI field. They have an oral drug. It's a MER24 enhancer. And read out positively in ulcerative colitis, you see a lot of us had discounted the likelihood of success based on the mechanism here, it's a very strange, maybe even unclear mechanism as to. How exactly a mirror 124 enhancer might go about. Having an anti-inflammatory effect in the colon. That's exactly what happened here. The phase three data were really solid. We had about 15 to 18 response rates, complete response rates, which compare relatively favorably to the injectable agents, the IL-23s. Skyrizzy, Trampaya, that are used in the syndication. Really solid efficacy for a drug that's oral.\n\n00:48:58,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n And safety looked good too. So this could be a big seller. The stock had a wild run. It was up over 500% this week. Its market cap is now $4 billion plus. I think they raised nearly $700 million just last night.\n\n00:49:14,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n really great success for it. innovative product, even if we don't fully understand the mechanism.","char_start":45423,"char_end":49779,"start_time":"00:45:26","end_time":null}

So congrats to the team at Avivax. I wanted to take the discussion in a little bit different direction, something that I found interesting. Having served a little time in industry myself.\n\n00:49:34,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it relates to some news flow from Prime Medicine last week and Prime's decision to replace employee options. I can imagine that this is something that many in the industry are concerning. I'd love to get your views on this, guys. What Prime has done is take its underwater options. The company went public about three years ago at $17 per share. Most of the options that are held by employees, by executives, by boards are now underwater for sure. I think trading at around $4 and change today. And this creates a problem, right? If you have underwater options, you feel like you're not participating in the success of the company, especially if those options are way underwater, as I'm sure. Many prime options are. And it prevents the options from doing what they're designed to do, which is aid employee retention.\n\n00:50:32,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n And get buy-in from the employees and directors and executives of the group that's aligned with shareholders.\n\n00:50:40,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I know that we in the investment world hate. When options are replaced, we feel like that misaligns the incentives that investors have. Maybe even create some disincentives to properly perform on behalf of investors.\n\n00:50:57,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n But I don't know, Brian, do you want to start off? Any views on whether?\n\n00:51:02,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n Prime's decision is a good one. What else we could have done to further address employee retention for all of these companies that are seeing their stocks crushed, maybe through no fault of the teams themselves.\n\n00:51:18,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah.\n\n00:51:20,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I don't have great thoughts. I would say I think it's a very tough dynamic. I get the need to retain people. I get the need that we are in a much different state than we were four years ago when we were sort of in this big bull market coming off COVID. But at the same time, I sort of also see the value to seeing a little bit of the correction here.\n\n00:51:48,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n credit and over-employment sector, having too many companies.\n\n00:51:53,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n In development, you know, on one hand, that's sort of a.\n\n00:51:58,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n I totally feel. The need and desire to try to retain key employees and try to maintain operations.\n\n00:52:08,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n But, you know, it's a catch-22, right?\n\n00:52:13,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sam, any thoughts?\n\n00:52:15,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n No, I think it's state.\n\n00:52:19,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, I agree with Brian.\n\n00:52:22,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n Skip to that.\n\n00:52:26,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, one thing that— maybe caught my attention was that board options were being repriced as part of this. I mean, I think I could make the case that rank and file employees, you know, need that incentive. They need to feel like they're part of the team. They need to feel that they have a reason to work hard for the equity. And they also have a decision to walk across the street and get their options repriced, essentially, if they want to go work. For CRISPR or for EDITAS or for the other genes. But. But the board maybe has more fiduciary duty to shareholders to be aligned and to to not um you know take the easy way out. I don't know if you have thoughts.","char_start":49479,"char_end":53278,"start_time":"00:49:14","end_time":null}

I don't want to like come off as like disparaging them, just like not super close to the situation. But I mean, it's like I've heard of a number of other companies like repricing people's options when there's been a blow up, right? Because at the end of the day, you can't. you can't double punish yourself. You can't have your drug, one of your key drugs not working, then all your key people leave. So I think that makes sense. The board piece seems, like it seems atypical to me, but someone could also tell me this has happened 2,500 times and I wouldn't know. I mean, do you? You have experience in the operating side. Like, have you heard of anything like this before?\n\n00:53:43,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I mean, we do.\n\n00:53:45,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n We've seen it a few times in our industry. It's not the first for sure, but there sometimes is an exclusion to board and senior management. For whatever reason, you know, this time around, Prime decided not to do that. I'm sure they have. Good reason. They actually stated that it might be more cumbersome or more expensive to. to exclude certain people from the repricing, but you know it is what it is. And we can move on. I know we have another other topics we want to cover.\n\n00:54:15,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe Sam, I'll turn it back to you. I think you wanted to talk about some pharma highlights.\n\n00:54:20,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, just a couple of things. We published, we have a proprietary licensing data set that we've been gathering for years.\n\n00:54:28,160 [SPEAKER_0]\n And we've been looking at it. We look at it every six months. And I just want to highlight one thing out of it, and that is the perennial conversation about China.\n\n00:54:37,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n The share of drug licensing for drugs sourced out of China rose to 14%. And now there are many ways you could cut. This, right? I mean, so we focus on actual drug licenses, we don't do any of these— look at any of those clinical collaborations or commercialization-type deals in terms of regional commercialization-type deals. So 14% is quite a hefty jump from the average 9% we had last year. And then, of course, close to nothing a few years back. And what was also interesting was that the majority of the drugs. That's close to 90% of them are biologics that people are interested in. So of course we all know what they are like— the biospecifics, etc. That's in contrast to the ex-China deals, where only 50% or so are biologics. And a whole bunch of them are almost half are preclinical discovery type deals. And the last point I want to make on that is the value perspective.\n\n00:55:43,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n When we want to look at how big these deals are, I'll just simply cut it at a billion dollars in terms of buyer dollars. And. Uh, that's where the China deals had about a 40% share of the billion-dollar plus um uh uh deals. So that's that's pretty uh uh pretty chunky number to to be looking at. So I'm going to then leave that at that. And the other thing was, which we've heard this week, of course, we had the Roche reporting. Last week, we had Novartis.\n\n00:56:16,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n And Johnson & Johnson, the only thing I want to focus on in there is they're all talking about this direct consumer drug selling. That the US is asking for them for. And what we've heard from Rush has talked about it a little bit now in headlines. Of course, Bristol-Myers and Pfizer did it or announced it with eloquence. Now, watch this. See, I said there is. The core of all is discussions with HHS, which is quite interesting. So how the whole thing will come through, do we need any legislation changes or not, it's going to be interesting to see. But it's quite interesting also that it's at the same time that we're getting talk about trying to stop advertising direct to consumers. You can sell direct to consumers, but you can't advertise to them. And put that together with what AstraZeneca announced, which was a $50 billion, five-year investment in the US.","char_start":52978,"char_end":57357,"start_time":"00:53:06","end_time":null}

Or maybe most favorite nations is not going to come along because they're all, at least on surface, doing things that the administration has been asking for. Over.\n\n00:57:26,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n I also took note of those comments from Roche's CEO about how the easiest way to bring down pricing would be to go direct, cut out the middleman, market to the consumer himself or herself.\n\n00:57:40,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n And that you could take down drug pricing easily about 50 percent he said right but I don't know if you guys caught the remarks from our president earlier in the week, kind of. tongue-in-cheek comments from me here but You know, apparently 50% isn't enough. Apparently we've got to bring drug prices down 500, 600, even 1,000%. So I don't know, Sam, any way that the Roche CO can bring down drug prices 1,000%.\n\n00:58:05,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, it's a small way.\n\n00:58:07,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't think his HHS secretary wants people to be paid to take drugs.\n\n00:58:14,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Once you're ready. Yeah.\n\n00:58:17,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n But let's hope that these moves will help us escape some more, some of those what I would call more draconian approaches that have been talked about.\n\n00:58:27,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think you're right. Things are definitely looking out for the industry in terms of less of an impact from MFN or tariffs or any of the macro fears we were so obsessed with.\n\n00:58:39,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Be careful. Be careful.\n\n00:58:43,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n We have to eat humble pie.\n\n00:58:46,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Good point.

The letters do not outline any statutory or regulatory authorities.\n\n00:01:10,890 [SPEAKER_5]\n That the administration has to enforce these demands, even though they did say they plan to enforce them. Sam and Brian, we'll start with you. Do you wanna comment on this?\n\n00:01:21,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n So let's have a go and then Brian will, I'm sure, add a whole bunch of stuff to it. So four elements: Daphne, as you quite clearly highlighted. Number one, extend MFN to Medicaid. I think that's going to be a relatively easy lift for pharma because Medicaid prices are some of the lowest.\n\n00:01:41,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n And they should be able to match that. Number four, provide direct purchasing to add MFN pricing, whatever that price ends up being, whatever formula is used for it. Again, pharma companies have already started doing some of this. By all accounts, they should be able to cut prices without really hurting their P &L by. 30%, 40%, and 50% in a direct consumer setting, given the sort of rebates that they give away to insurers. Let's say there's a mechanism that [that] can actually happen and they start doing it. It's the two elements in the middle that are a bit of a complication for me. On the one hand, guarantee MFN pricing for newly launched drugs. So that is the MFN story that's been going around for a while now. Let's get new drugs launched at a good price in the US, which is great. The good thing here is it says 'newly launched drugs.' So it sounds like that there is at least an acceptance that you can't retrograde this. So all the products that are on the market would stay at the sort of prices they are. The question then is, what happens if somebody comes with a new GLP-1 and they launch it at a lower price?\n\n00:02:48,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then what happens to all the other products that are on the market? For example, up for discussion. And then, of course, the bit that I really don't get my head around, can't get my head around, is return your increased revenues from outside the US to patients in the US and taxpayers. Well, how are you going to enforce that? And what is the point of MFN? If you then do result in the increase and the fairness that the administration is looking for, pushing ex-US prices up, what is the incentive in doing that if they're going to ask for them to send the money back, assuming you could, assuming you had a legal basis to do that? And all of this put together. I'm trying to still understand. On the one hand, you're trying to tell pharma companies to bring their manufacturing footprint into the US. Continue to invest in US R&D. At the same time, you want to hit them with reduced profitability. And your argument has always been, you make most of your money here, bring them your drugs over here, sell them over here, make them over here.\n\n00:03:50,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n But at the same time, we don't want to pay for it. That sounds like a not well thought-through process. And the last thing I'll say before I pass on to Brian is the goal is set for the September 29. This is getting very close to the next negotiation dates for IRA.\n\n00:04:07,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Our Washington analyst Duane Wright believes that in the end, it'll end up being implemented through IRA by just pushing for an order on the price negotiations.\n\n00:04:17,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n Brian.","char_start":0,"char_end":4372,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

You know, I think I was on the Regeneron call today and Lunch Life, the CEO, was one of the three who had written a letter and then Trump crossed out their formal title and wrote their first name. I think Trump missed the ultimate power move to actually just put the wrong names. He should have written Leo, Dan, and Arnold instead of David Lennon. Hours, but, um, Look, you know, I think.\n\n00:04:45,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's funny, when Trump kind of laid out MFN, you know, maybe a month and a half ago, and this has obviously been something coming from even his first administration and IPI, which is the prior duration, I think conceptually. I don't think it's a terrible idea. I think there are huge disparities between what the U. S. pays for drugs and what other relatively wealthy countries pay for drugs. And I think UK is sort of the prime example of these massive disparities. In drug pricing. And I think conceptually, it's a good idea to try to you know, find a more common ground or at least a GDP adjusted common ground between the two prices. I think, you know, as Sam, as you highlighted, I think the problem with with a lot of kind of the ideas behind the Trump administration that I think superficially are good is. just they're kind of so aggressive and not necessarily well thought out. They create much more chaos than sort of like the simple explanation we would have. Regeneron brought up on their call this morning, just the fact that they don't make the price of ILEA XUS, right?\n\n00:05:52,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n They've partnered that out. So they don't really have an ability. to do anything other than be forced to pay a much lower ILEA price because Bayer has no real incentive to raise the Axio price because there's no equilibrium in terms of profitability there. If someone controlled the worldwide pricing, that's a little bit of a different story. But but I think, you know, just kind of signals and we'll get into this a little more when we talk about the FDA. But, you know, there's so many things that are being tried. And, you know. Maybe a lot of it is in an effort to find better negotiation. But if these are implemented in mass, it's going to create so many disturbances across the sector. And I think that chaos is really what I worry the most about.\n\n00:06:44,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Definitely. If I just put out also, I think we haven't, we've not been able to find a legal framework through which this could be easily implemented. If the administration decides to go full combat zone on this, then I suspect that comes will bring all their power to resist it from a legal perspective.\n\n00:07:04,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, and we have a whole bunch of legal brains in our group which tell me that. So I'm just the.\n\n00:07:12,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n And the other element, of course, is we've just been hearing from these Parma executives how wonderful and productive their conversations with HHS has been with regards to direct-to-consumer and everything. And then they wake up and get this letter. So, I mean, I don't know if the right hand is aware of what the left hand is doing or not, or whether this is just something we're going to have to get to and cope with.\n\n00:07:38,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n We don't see a resolution of this that easily, except for a couple of points that we talked about, decay than the direct consumer.\n\n00:07:45,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, there's bipartisan support for drug reform and meaningful drug reform. So if the industry or those companies that were called out— want to dig in their heels and fight back. I think that was kind of the point that. Trump was making in the letter which is 'Play Ball with us' because if you don't play ball with us, it's it's going to be potentially much unclear for the sector and then of course, you know, in the background, you have China emerging as a lower cost provider of innovation and so, you know, if you're going to try to force countries around the world to pay a higher price, you're going to have to figure out how to make sure that they're not going to get a better price out of comparable therapies coming from China.","char_start":4074,"char_end":8555,"start_time":"00:04:07","end_time":null}

We'll have to see where this all goes.\n\n00:08:45,339 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah. We're going to come back to China in a little bit. Paul, go ahead.\n\n00:08:49,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I was just going to say, I think in the backdrop of this, the investment community is still massively discounting this becoming a reality, I think. I mean, when I just look at certain stocks I cover that have big XUS price discrepancies, um, and what this could actually mean for them, like I know I know Sam was opining on the Pharmas, but some of like the biotech companies that have concentrated revenues, like you know companies like Vertex or Neurocrin, who you know it doesn't have a big XUS presence, but Ingress is sold in Japan. I mean, this could be super, super meaningful. And I still feel like most investors are looking at how tariffs played out, right? Where, you know, the first offer was something that decimated the stock market and was seen as extremely recessionary. And then how it ultimately played out over time was considerably more benign. So I think that, at least, where the reality is, as it relates to how the sector is trading on this. And we'll see if that ends up being right or wrong. But you saw this letter came out yesterday.\n\n00:09:49,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n And yeah, the market was under pressure. But it wasn't at all like day one, the liberation day trading that we saw.\n\n00:09:56,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n Keep in mind, though, the nuance that companies are expected to submit their pricing data overseas to the U. S. government. So when you have one company selling a drug in the U. S. and a very different company selling the same drug outside the U. S., it may be difficult to get that other company to disclose their prices. So there may be some nuances, right? That would pertain perhaps to a to a neurocrine and contrast so much so that we don't know—so much that we need to better understand if and how this is going to play out. But I don't think many are at this point arguing that this is a good thing. Although, the offset here is— if you can get higher prices ex-U. S. and reasonably protect your U. S. prices— then there's a plausible, perhaps not likely, but plausible scenario that that some companies can come out of this ahead.\n\n00:10:47,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, Josh, if this is applied, if there's some sort of negotiation at the end of the day. This is applied to new launches.\n\n00:10:57,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n And there's not that many existing drugs that are getting hit hard. I mean, you could argue that that's bullish for certain drug areas.\n\n00:11:06,660 [SPEAKER_5]\n And I think that directionally, just one second. So I think directionally, it's where the administration is going. But my sense is that it's not written in stone and so the investor perspective— let's wait and see how it actually plays out— is probably correct. And I spent some time in D. C. with advisors to the administration, as well as Dr. Oz. I'm happy to comment on that in a minute, but go ahead, Sam.\n\n00:11:32,120 [SPEAKER_3]\n Can you just postulate a possible future? Let's say the agreement is in place. That new drugs will launch at the most favorite nation. However, we all know that new drugs almost always launch first in the US.\n\n00:11:45,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I'll postulate this and Josh, you guys can shoot it down or modify it or say it's not possible.","char_start":8255,"char_end":12213,"start_time":"00:08:26","end_time":null}

I'm bringing it to the US market. The price that we would use in our models would be the average of what we think the drug should get relative to the other drugs that are on the market in the US. Plus a medium, because it extends survival by 500 years. And therefore, instead of 300,000, now I am in this new world. I've got a new launch. I'm going to price it at 600,000, say, right? And then wait two years, which is about the sort of time it takes to get the European launches going, usually.\n\n00:12:24,280 [SPEAKER_3]\n and then launch over there, maybe at a slight premium, and then bring it down to a premium to what the history would have been. In the first two years, I've cashed enough in there to make up the difference for the next three or four years. Does that make any sense to anyone?\n\n00:12:43,450 [SPEAKER_6]\n Kind of like the practice in Germany.\n\n00:12:46,760 [SPEAKER_6]\n I think what you see now with high-priced drugs in the band that you're talking about. It's things like F-Gortigimod, right, where the price is actually basically the same in Europe as it is here. And roughly, they've just given up on European access. I mean, like you look at Argenix's sales, such a huge percentage of that's coming from the U.S. I think we're talking about that price band. I think that's what most. companies will do i think the tough questions here for like the glit manufacturers and things like that where Where?\n\n00:13:15,900 [SPEAKER_6]\n it's a more complicated situation. The one thing I'd say, just, just. i don't have a lot to add to this conversation is the honest answer but the one thing i would say is I think. This whole thing that I hear a lot of like, we don't know what legal framework the administration could use to accomplish this. I think that represents a fundamental lack of creativity and imagination relative to like what the administration has done to higher ed. Or what they've done in the tariff sphere or in other places. I think, if the administration got really serious about this, they would absolutely be able to find tools to make life unpleasant, including by the regulatory agencies, by FDA and HHS, and other places. I think there's a lot of tools the administration has. If they really decide they care about this, to put real pressure.\n\n00:13:57,970 [SPEAKER_4]\n What's interesting, and Matt, even in your comments, we kind of focus on Europe. When we think about most favored nation, we don't think about China, despite the China prices being a fraction of the European prices. It's an interesting dynamic.\n\n00:14:10,830 [SPEAKER_6]\n I think we'd all definitely love to hear what you heard in Washington, though. That's right. FGARD is much cheaper in China than it is in Europe. That's absolutely true.\n\n00:14:17,670 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, so what I heard in general was that the administration is actually looking to collaborate with industry. They want proposals from industry, they are going directionally in this. On this path, but they are open to ideas and they're also open to hearing. What's flawed about their proposals. And I found that to be very reassuring. In terms of Oz, who will be involved in the implementation of this, I had a chance to meet with him and hear from him a little bit. And some of the themes that he was commenting on were that CMS really wants to work with industry in a collaborative way, and CMS is really targeting fraud, waste, and in particular, middlemen inefficiencies, so PBMs.","char_start":11913,"char_end":15733,"start_time":"00:11:45","end_time":null}

By the way, one of the ways of enabling MFN would be to eliminate the middlemen in the U. S. because that doesn't exist. That whole framework doesn't exist in Europe or ex-U. S. I also heard that CMS is committed to sustaining early stage biotech and not just CMS, everybody I met in Washington. and CMS in particular through reimbursement clarity and regulatory support. They really want to hear from innovators. And another theme that I heard from everybody I met was a major concern around China. and China's IP theft. and its threat to U. S. biotech leadership. So this is a big theme for the administration and I think that this is kind of the bullish. up. piece of it but we can come back to uh China but Actually, maybe we'll go to China now and then come back to Prasad afterwards. So. In terms of, well. Yeah, in terms of China, there were some deals. But I think that the key thing on China is that it now accounts for 30% of global clinical trial starts.\n\n00:16:05,160 [SPEAKER_5]\n It's nearly matching the U. S. share, which is 35%. In 2023, China's drug assets represented 24% of the entire global biopharma pipeline, and that's up from just 2% a decade earlier. And most concerning is Chinese companies copying IP and then moving to fast-track development. So basically, they can read about something either in a patent filing or in a publication, and then move much faster. They can get multiple companies working, and with the regulatory framework, obviously surpassed their U.S. counterparts.\n\n00:16:38,890 [SPEAKER_5]\n Coupled with pharma companies, then going and doing big deals in China with cheap Me Too programs. So, as I said, I spent some time in DC also talking to economic advisors to the administration and proposal ideas. I think these are really early, but they seem to be open to them. So one concept would be introducing regulatory reimbursement and funding-related penalties to protect U. S. intellectual property. And then another idea— or another general theme was around incentives around M&A. That only apply to U. S.-based biotechs, for example, amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow U. S.-based biotech companies to retain their NOLs. Um. So following dilutive financing and M &A transactions, which would make those companies much more attractive. So those are some ideas. I know we're going to come back to the China deal, but anybody want to comment on that before we go to Prasad, which was the other big news of the week?\n\n00:17:37,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n This is Brad's favorites.\n\n00:17:40,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Topic. Come on, Brad.\n\n00:17:42,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n What do you think of those proposals?\n\n00:17:45,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n On NFM or on the China site? No, on the China. The ones that are definitely just Pokemon. I think the tax thing should definitely happen.\n\n00:17:56,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n In the minority. I think that something politically big is going to happen with China over the next two or three years.\n\n00:18:05,669 [SPEAKER_2]\n The GSK thing and all of the deals that are happening, I don't fault anybody for doing those deals. Everybody's acting in their own self-interest.\n\n00:18:18,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n The thing that you have to take a step back and look at— is that our industry's relationship with China is the exact opposite of every other industry.\n\n00:18:32,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Meaning every other industry is outsourcing the stuff that doesn't matter, like the cheap manufacturing. You know, I always use this analogy. It's that iconic slogan on every Apple product, designed by Apple in California.\n\n00:18:51,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n So nobody cares that iPhones are being made in China because that's not the valuable part of the equation of what Apple is doing. The valuable part is inventing new technologies.\n\n00:19:06,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Our industry is doing the exact opposite. We are outsourcing the innovation part. So, like.","char_start":15433,"char_end":19722,"start_time":"00:14:59","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_4fb9857a2b2d_chunk_0005","doc_id":"doc_4fb9857a2b2d","order":5,"text":"]\n So nobody cares that iPhones are being made in China because that's not the valuable part of the equation of what Apple is doing. The valuable part is inventing new technologies.\n\n00:19:06,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Our industry is doing the exact opposite. We are outsourcing the innovation part. So, like.\n\n00:19:14,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n The GSK drugs, like, if they had that label, it would say. 'Designed by Hang really in China and.' If you're GSK, you're doing what's in your best interest because they can do R &D. They can get to a phase one proof of concept on those drugs.\n\n00:19:35,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Literally years faster than they could do themselves doing their own R &D. So I don't fault them for doing what's in their best interest. But if you're a politician, and most of the politicians, like our industry is too technical. They don't understand it yet. Like another thing to keep in mind is the semiconductor industry has gone through this, and it took the politicians years to understand the semiconductor industry. Like we're next, and we're even more technical than that. So it's going to take them a little longer to understand our industry. But when the politicians whose job is to think of the long-term competitive, like GSK, you would, I mean, obviously it's a. you know an Anglo-Swedish company, but like, um, their job is not to think of the long-term competitiveness of the United States and what could happen geopolitically further on down the road. That is the job of a politician. So when the politicians start to understand that we're outsourcing the innovation part, we're outsourcing the science part of what we do, they're going to freak out and they're going to make changes that's going to make it a lot more difficult to do business with China, just like has happened with the\n\n00:20:53,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n semiconductor industry.\n\n00:20:55,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm in the minority on that opinion, but I do think it's inevitable that something happens like that unless our relationship with China somehow magically got better. And I think the odds of that are practically zero. So I think something big is going to happen on this over the next two or three years.\n\n00:21:15,340 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, I don't think you're in the minority, Brad. I think you're spot on and I think it might happen sooner.\n\n00:21:20,670 [SPEAKER_6]\n Can I say, I think this is a conversation though that I hear all the time. And I agree with a lot of, Brad, I think I agree with you on a lot of things about China. But I think that, again, I feel like all of this discourse that's like, 'we're outsourcing the innovative part to China.' I think that is just missing a transformation that is happening in front of our noses, which is that this is not the innovative part anymore. Generating 50- CD19 T cell engagers, each one a novel molecule, and generating phase one data for 50 T cell engagers, each one a novel molecule. It just turns out that's a commodity good now. We built an industry in the US that was like designed to think of that thing as the innovative thing. And it's not anymore.\n\n00:22:02,670 [SPEAKER_6]\n And I feel like that is an adjustment that we're all going to have to make, because I feel like even if you figured out how to block it from happening between the U. S. and China, it turns out that there will be other. It's just not that hard to generate a new T cell engager now. And so people are going to be able to do it. And I feel like that change is something that we need to start reacting to as an industry.\n\n00:22:23,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I agree with that.\n\n00:22:26,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n But. What you're describing is what's going on today.\n\n00:22:31,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n We are literally, and by the way, another thing that's important to know about all of this is China is actually on. We talk about China's biotech sector.\n\n00:22:42,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n As if it's unstoppable and inevitable.\n\n00:22:46,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n They're on thinner ice than we are because they are 100% reliant on succeeding in the United States to even have a biotech sector.

So, um, like they're like we talk about them as if they're unstoppable, but they're not. Like, they're in really thin ice. If we make uh major changes here, but the thing that I would disagree with Matt is: We are right now what they're doing is like what I would agree with you is not like super innovative, like new inventions, but we're basically funding their knowledge. And at the same time, we've stopped funding our startups that are working on discovery and early stage science. Like, that 30% of deals, it's going to Chinese companies. That means it's not going to U. S. companies. And there's companies that don't exist today that like. Would have existed under our traditional way of doing this.\n\n00:24:02,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n The challenge is that these Chinese companies are going to get, if we keep funding their growth, like if we're paying for their college tuition, so to speak. There will absolutely be, in a couple of years, if not sooner, a new phase to this where we have funded their knowledge to the point that they are innovating on everything.\n\n00:24:30,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n The way that the regulatory structure is today and their costs, like you can have five people there for every one here. It's just like simple math of like. Like, what salaries cost and same with manufacturing, like everything. I always say, like, when it comes to China, everything that we have here, they could have. Five there for the same cost, like it's going to be really hard to regulate, like just make FDA rules looser and say, well, we'll be able to compete hand in hand with them. I don't think so. So, so if we get to a point where.\n\n00:25:08,669 [SPEAKER_2]\n Anyway, we could talk for hours about this. But this will go to a new phase.\n\n00:25:15,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Where they're out innovating on things that are truly new, and we do not have the ability to keep up because things are so much cheaper and quicker there that it's impossible to change the regulatory structure here to level that playing field exactly.\n\n00:25:32,850 [SPEAKER_7]\n Do you have one more second on this or not? If it's something new, go ahead.\n\n00:25:39,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let me see. Can I provoke and say, cross out China, just as President Trump did on his letters, and put Europe.\n\n00:25:48,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n If this was Europe, which we would, I don't know, I would love it to be, but it's not.\n\n00:25:53,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n Would we have the same consternation? Would we have the same issue?\n\n00:25:57,340 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah. So I think that the biggest issue is around theft of IP. And if there was a way to tie that to other. you know, for example, regulatory or reimbursement or other. other aspects, I think that would be a good deterrent. I don't think that's as big of an issue in Europe. And I also don't think they're not. They're not doing what China's doing in terms of the speed. But let's move on because we have a lot of topics to cover.\n\n00:26:24,030 [SPEAKER_5]\n One of the other big news items of the week, of course, was Vinay Prasad. FDA CBER director stepping down after some controversial decisions, including actually reportedly overruling his reviewers six times in about that many weeks. He was only three months in the position, which translates into around eight Scaramucci's for those who follow that. And all eyes are on who will replace him at CBER with rumors of a potential restructuring. at FDA to spin out the vaccines division and combine CBER and CDER. Skorny, you predicted Prasad leaving, so let's start with you.","char_start":23218,"char_end":27223,"start_time":"00:22:42","end_time":null}

Skorny, you predicted Prasad leaving, so let's start with you.\n\n00:26:58,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, well, you know, I certainly felt the actions that he took and sort of the response in particular on sort of, you know, some on the MAGA side of things, on the MAHA side of things, you know, was particularly aggressive. And look, I mean. A lot of us have been following Vinay for the last decade. I mean, he is a person to rock the boat, whether you agree or disagree with him. He is loud and he is. You know, pretty forceful with his views. So, you know, I just think he tried to do too much too quickly, rock the boat too much. And ultimately that. You know, drew the ire of, of sort of the Maga Maha crowd and, and, uh, reporting, you know, maybe Trump himself.\n\n00:27:46,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, he is gone. And I think it's, you know, it has a lot to do with sort of him coming in and taking aggressive tactics on a number of applications, but most notably is probably his response to the Sarepta controversy with the two DMD deaths on Alevitus, a third LGMD death with a related product.\n\n00:28:12,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, another DMD death on elevators from uh not the same liver toxicity but uh you know, potentially related immunosuppression and resulting in an infection that resulted in a patient's death. So, yeah, I mean, I think it's a very, you know, I think for stocks, given the concerns that industry had over him in particular.\n\n00:28:40,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Holding programs to a much higher bar than, you know, certainly we're used to for Peter Marks, but arguably a bar that we'd never really seen before in industry at the FDA. His removal has been viewed by investors as at least near-term positive for stocks in that. You know, a lot of these companies with small data sets, more ambiguous data sets, but in indications that are very tough to develop drugs in, might be given more leniency under an FDA that doesn't have him running CBER and being CMO and CSO.\n\n00:29:16,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n So was he too lenient? With how he handled Sarepta or was he not lenient enough, because of how he's handled Sarepta and a bunch of other applications?\n\n00:29:29,960 [SPEAKER_5]\n I think it had to do a lot with this inconsistency with his review team. So the idea of overruling your team and also inconsistency with previous guidance. And I think that was one angle. The other was political. And actually, I'd love to come to Matt. You mentioned that Doug Ingram. has a history of fighting FDA on things and winning. I'm not sure how much. Sarepta actually was behind any of this, including the political pushback.\n\n00:29:56,310 [SPEAKER_6]\n Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm not either. You know, Doug at Allergan was heavily involved in the Botax sort of marketing lawsuits. Obviously, he was involved at Sarepta when Alevitus was first approved and sort of mobilizing the patient groups then.\n\n00:30:12,980 [SPEAKER_6]\n I guess. My honest view is it would be a little bit surprising if you had a coordinated campaign from Laura Loomer, the Wall Street Journal op-ed page.\n\n00:30:22,959 [SPEAKER_6]\n And all the patient attitudes and everything else, and it turned out that Sarepta had nothing to do with it, so. Especially given his history, I guess like my view from the outside is that I'm not like a conspiracy theorist, but it seems like there's something there, right?\n\n00:30:35,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I just say, Matt, you know, not to diminish Doug's role in regulatory success, but, you know, I would also note Sarepta has managed this. Regulatory success through three different CEOs. And it's too bad Chris isn't on today because he's one of them. Ed, Kay and Doug are the other two. And, you know, I just wonder, is it the person in that seat that is responsible for this, or is it someone else? Because I would argue that it's more likely organizations like MDA, PPMD, Cure Duchenne, a lot of them. US could probably even call out specific mothers who have had direct influence on ultimate decision makers within the FDA around DMD drug approvals. And it sounds like that may even be the case. Case to some extent, based on some of the reporting in this case as well around the Elevitus reintroduction and even Van Nuys ouster.","char_start":26923,"char_end":31402,"start_time":"00:26:58","end_time":null}

Who even wants that job?\n\n00:31:42,620 [SPEAKER_7]\n Yeah.\n\n00:31:43,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n It's a great point. George does, maybe.\n\n00:31:47,110 [SPEAKER_5]\n Right. And I think, you know, what I continue to hear from colleagues is still generally positive sentiment about Commissioner McCary. So the fifth FDA listening session. With about 60 industry CEOs and senior executives, took place in New York right after Prasad left and George Tidmar. The New Cedar had joined him on that one. And what McCary talked about was in line with previous sessions around streamlining FDA operations, eliminating redundancies, reducing duplicate testing, regulatory flexibility. He kept talking about that. Enhancing post-market surveillance through centralized adverse event databases, incentivizing U. S. manufacturing via a gold card, and um rejecting certain foreign e. g. Chinese data and emphasizing rare disease placebo. Free trials and more timely agency responses. So Matt, you were at this one. What did you take away from it?\n\n00:32:44,430 [SPEAKER_6]\n Yeah, I mean, overall it was a benign, helpful, favorable obsession.\n\n00:32:51,320 [SPEAKER_6]\n I think he came across, to your point, about the administration generally. I think he came across as open-minded. I think he came across as genuinely interested in figuring out ways to make the agency more effective. I think, if, a third of what he said came to pass, it would be all good for the biotech industry. And I think he came across as serious in the attempt. I think the two things that were notable, I mean, Prasad had departed the night before, and the name Prasad was not mentioned in the three-hour session once. Which I thought was like a 'whatever,' it was a notable experience sitting in that room with whatever. It was about 100 people in total, and, like, it just never came up. I thought that was, like, interesting. And then the other thing that was interesting is there. There was a specific discussion around Cedar and CBER alignment. And I think he made it pretty clear that a thing that he thinks is useful is getting Cedar and CBER much more closely aligned with one another. He had George sitting right there. George had obviously been. Sort of appointed interim head of CBER in addition to his role as CEDAR, you know, sort of immediately prior to the session. And I thought that was also an interesting note, especially in light of what had happened.\n\n00:33:56,860 [SPEAKER_6]\n Uh, and almost Whatever. Lemonade of lemons, whatever it was, like almost made. Made the sequence seem intentional as a part of bringing the two centers closer together.\n\n00:34:08,250 [SPEAKER_7]\n Mm-hmm.\n\n00:34:09,940 [SPEAKER_5]\n All right, so we have a few more policy-related things. Sam, quickly on tariffs, and then we'll go to Josh on other drama around RFK.\n\n00:34:20,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, so tariffs, we had the August 1st came, midnight last night. We had the 15% tariff that's been handed out to many countries that even did deal. So European Union has got the 15%. At the beginning of it, that was last week, obviously, there was a bit of a back and forth between different groups as to whether pharmaceuticals were included or not. And I think the final bottom line was that pharmaceuticals were included.\n\n00:34:47,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then overnight we had the 35%. I can never remember what the exact is because I've also seen 37% mentioned somewhere. But Switzerland, which of course impacts, Roche and Novartis, but then there was a question as to whether that includes pharmaceuticals or not. Semiconductors don't really matter so much to Switzerland, but pharmaceuticals clearly do. And my understanding is pharmaceuticals are included in the conversation, but whoever wants to correct us online should follow up the conversation. Do it.","char_start":31102,"char_end":35514,"start_time":"00:31:25","end_time":null}

And my understanding is pharmaceuticals are included in the conversation, but whoever wants to correct us online should follow up the conversation.

So there's still time for these to be corrected. And we'll see how that pans out. And that's where we are with tariffs, as regards the overall pharmaceuticals. I don't think there was another element to tariffs to cover. Was there, Daphne?\n\n00:35:41,620 [SPEAKER_5]\n No, I mean, I think an important practical consideration is that most U. S. small to mid-sized biotech companies don't have the capital or capability to move their manufacturing, and many rely on So until there's sufficient and affordable U. S. capacity at CDMOs, it's going to be. small tough for smaller companies to comply but you know 15 is is not is manageable yeah it's manageable yeah Okay. So, Josh, you wanted to talk about other RFK dramas.\n\n00:36:07,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, well, there's something in the news nearly every week. Now, a couple of news items. One, he wants to restructure the preventive health task force that makes recommendations for medical screening, apparently viewing them as too woke. Admittedly, they are quite woke. I don't know what 'too woke' means. And he wants it to have fewer doctors and nurses and more dieticians and therapists. And hopefully that will be. smoother than what he's done to the ACIP panel, which is still very contentious. And then the other interesting move that he's come out with, not surprisingly, is overhauling the vaccine injury program and wanting vaccine injury victims to be compensated quickly and fairly, which is obviously going to mean a lot of litigation for his litigation friends. I think it's going to be very difficult, though, to through vaccine injury it'll be very interesting to see if this whole do vaccines cause autism no it's not much of a debate i think most everyone who understands the literature doesn't doesn't view so but it's that fringe view that vaccines are are\n\n00:37:10,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n associated with autism Imagine it making its way into a Supreme Court litigation around vaccine injuries. So lots more to come out of out of HHS.\n\n00:37:21,640 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, and you guys a few weeks ago talked a lot about some of the panels, and I think that the experts that they're choosing there, there's definitely some concern. around that. There was also some news yesterday that the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the administration's proposed funding cut to the NIH, advancing a measure that would increase the budget by about $400 million. I didn't have much time to dig into that, but it seems to be good news for the biotech ecosystem if it plays out. So let's move to some deals. Matt, you wanted to talk about the GSK-Hengry deal and then. Also, Josh and Matt talk about the BMS Bain SpinCo.\n\n00:38:00,520 [SPEAKER_6]\n Yeah, on GSK Hungary, I don't have much to say beyond the conversation we already had on China before. I don't know if— If I'm Yeah, so we can move on.\n\n00:38:08,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n So let's go to the BMS Bain SpinCo.\n\n00:38:11,769 [SPEAKER_6]\n So this is a deal structure that my company, Roivant, has a lot of familiarity with. It's what we did with Pfizer, with Tilavant and Privant.","char_start":35214,"char_end":38778,"start_time":"00:35:19","end_time":null}

I don't know if— If I'm Yeah, so we can move on.\n\n00:38:08,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n So let's go to the BMS Bain SpinCo.\n\n00:38:11,769 [SPEAKER_6]\n So this is a deal structure that my company, Roivant, has a lot of familiarity with. It's what we did with Pfizer, with Tilavant and Privant.\n\n00:38:18,750 [SPEAKER_6]\n The thing that I thought was interesting about it, look— other than I think TR-78 is a promising class— I think it's a little bit interesting to see it go into this sort of structure. Obviously, lupus is an increasingly crowded indication. The deal that was done, I think people follow along, but Bristol did a deal with Bain where they took a collection of assets, the lead among them is a phase three TLR-78, uh, mostly an SLE and put it into a spinco where Bristol kept about 20% of it. Bain presumably owns the rest and made a $300 million financing commitment, along with relative amounts and obligations back to Bristol. Look, I think this continues to underscore that, you know, even as Bristol's had a pretty good run relative to where they were, but even as these companies are recovering and figuring things out, they have a lot of P &L pressure. They need to work on their portfolios and they need to make tough decisions. And look, obviously, I think it's good for all of us, good for the industry if those tough decisions involve creative partnership structures that allow those programs to continue to be developed. So I was.\n\n00:39:17,180 [SPEAKER_6]\n Happy to see it and expect we'll see more. And more similar things happening from them and from others in the future.\n\n00:39:24,500 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, and Bean did the CeraVil one, and that was very successful. They've been very successful.\n\n00:39:30,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Daphne? Yeah, go ahead. Can I just add a couple of things on the GSK Hungary? Just a couple. In terms of size, it was the third largest deal in terms of buyer dollars ever. So the biggest one was Daiichi Merck, $22 billion. Recursion and Roche, $12 billion, which was, of course, 40 targets, etc. But I think there's one point we need to bring out here, and that is that GSK has basically bought a whole bunch of options. And what it highlights is that they've given Hungary they've taken the right to products that Hingry takes through phase one. And at that point, they make a decision. And the exact point that we just talked about was they can do these phase ones and that early stage development much faster and much cheaper than currently we can. And that's what we, I think, that's what Matt was trying to say too. That's what we need to fix. But what GSK is getting at is good human data, including non-Chinese patients. For a fraction of the cost in the end, of course, Henry's a profit in that, and they get to the option to take that at that point. That's what I think is attracting people there.\n\n00:40:32,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n And also, it's unfair to say there's no innovation. I mean, if you do one VEGF by specifics, where did that come from?\n\n00:40:38,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n But let me just to that point. Yeah, let me just very quickly agree with you and just say. Think of this deal this way. It really shines a light on what a structural problem this is.\n\n00:40:53,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n Hey, Groovy is not. And his.\n\n00:40:58,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n GSK has been inventing new medicines for literally over 100 years.\n\n00:41:03,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Groovy has been doing that for like four years.\n\n00:41:08,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n So the fact that GSK is like, we need to outsource our science. To this company. Like, if you'd asked me. Four or five years ago, what are the you know] out of the 50 China biotech companies like? Rank them in terms of like the impressiveness of their work. And Groovy would be in the bottom five or ten. It is a traditionally generic drug maker. And so the fact that GSK, which has been at the forefront of science literally for over a century, is like, we need to outsource our science part to these guys because it's just so much faster and better, I think really goes to show what a structural problem this is like clearly. So I think it's a great example of.\n\n00:42:02,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, of, of, of. You know, eventually people are going to pick up on this. And I think it's a glaring example of like what the issue at stake is here.","char_start":38478,"char_end":42801,"start_time":"00:38:08","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_4fb9857a2b2d_chunk_0011","doc_id":"doc_4fb9857a2b2d","order":11,"text":"and better, I think really goes to show what a structural problem this is like clearly.

And I think it's a glaring example of like what the issue at stake is here.\n\n00:42:13,940 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, it's a great point. So, Paul, I want to hear a little bit from you. Let's talk about the AbbVie Gilgamesh $1 billion deal rumors. I'm not sure if there's any news on that today. And then also some good launches in biotech and whether shorting the launch is a dead thesis.\n\n00:42:31,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, I think the Abbey Gilgamesh rumors reported by Bloomberg, I think, are interesting because I think if this happens, it reflects, you know, another player that's a mainstream player in the case of Abbey here and J &J over there going all in on on psychedelics. Right. And. Taking a step back, psychedelics kind of emerged on the public market scene, maybe six or seven years ago. They had very niche interests from investors. And I think there were some really, really significant commercial questions around the scalability of the model with these drugs. But J &J has seemingly validated that to a degree with Spravato, which looks like it's on its way to being a $2 billion plus drug and not that long. And Spravato is certainly a nice product, but it's given every other week. And even with that cumbersome- cumbersome dosing paradigm, the utilization is growing really, really fast, right? So AbbVie doing the steal for Gilgamesh, who's a mid-stage player, has some some data. We'll see how the data ultimately plays out over time and their differentiation.\n\n00:43:35,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, you know, it's validating for the space, right, for companies like Compass, GH, Med. It's a space we're following closely, and all of these programs have their own idiosyncrasies, their own questions around safety, their own questions around scalability in the real world. But I think Josh mentioned this over the email, right? I mean, Compass now has a phase three study in the bag, and they're looking to meet with the FDA soon to see if there's even a path to filing sooner than they expect. Right. So I think there's a lot of moving parts here, but ultimately feels like there's broad support politically for these drugs and the medical community for these drugs. And I think the compass situation is going to be interesting because the psychiatry division is notoriously, I don't want to say conservative, but pretty by the book in terms of what they expect from companies.\n\n00:44:22,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so Compass having a phase two study and a phase three, and not completing the second phase three, I mean, traditionally, that would just be a nonstarter from a follow-up perspective. But, but if it's ever going to change, it could be now, right in this kind of environment for psychedelics.\n\n00:44:35,050 [SPEAKER_8]\n I don't know if anyone wants to add anything.\n\n00:44:40,180 [SPEAKER_7]\n No.\n\n00:44:40,830 [SPEAKER_5]\n Keep going. Let's talk about. Launches in biotech on Nylum, Argenix, Neurocrine.\n\n00:44:46,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, sure. I mean, our team was kind of looking back at some of our older models from companies I've covered for a decade or longer and just looking at what the spend was— early days in a launch back then versus now. And I think we're seeing this theme where, just midsize, small to midsize companies, are just much more well-resourced and much more sophisticated when they launch drugs. It also feels like they're more sophisticated at you know managing down expectations. Um, and I thought this week was was just interesting, right? Where it looks like it was a second quarter that was pretty good, broadly on an industry perspective. But, you know, you saw Almilum blow out numbers, even the backdrop of super high expectations for butrecerin and TTR cardiomyopathy. You've seen Neurocrine with their drug, Cranesity, in CAH.","char_start":42501,"char_end":46520,"start_time":"00:42:02","end_time":null}

You've seen Neurocrine with their drug, Cranesity, in CAH.\n\n00:45:34,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, get over a thousand patients close to starting therapy. And just a year or two ago, I mean, I think most people thought that that was going to be a fairly small product. I mean, there was Verona, Madrigal. I mean, the list sort of goes on here and it's just like interesting, right? I mean, I think like it's not. This is something that might still, I think, there's still a lot of impediments to getting generalists in the sector. But, you know, I think like short the launch was kind of the cliche. Right. And it feels like now that's become just a lot more dangerous for people. And I would even say that in my coverage universe, the commercial stories are, you know, more in favor versus how they've been historically, where I feel like kind of the better way to play biotech was to do, you know, ClinDev stories and kind of dream the dream. But once a company launches the drug, the financial reality gets a little bit more complicated and challenging to grapple with. I just think, in this year, we've really been seeing the opposite.\n\n00:46:31,590 [SPEAKER_5]\n Josh, you cover Bridge Bio as well. I saw Neil last week. That's another example, I think.\n\n00:46:38,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I mean, we're in a different era now. It's an exciting era.\n\n00:46:44,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think investors have broadly taken note of it as well. I think, for me, what's an interesting theme, though, is that they're looking at some of these companies that are having good product launches and thinking about what comes next and looking at some of the pipeline programs that aren't really getting a lot of value recognition.\n\n00:47:01,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n How much of this is due to analysts also thinking, well, look, we've learned from this short launch, so let's be conservative and management being more conservative with guidance?\n\n00:47:11,600 [SPEAKER_4]\n Or how much does it come from drug prices being like three times higher than they used to be? So everything is multiplied by three. But Sam, to your point, yeah, I mean, there's multifactorial and there have been a lot of adjustments and learnings along the way. I don't think it's all just expectation setting. Um, part of it, but I think there's also uh operational execution that's that's changed.\n\n00:47:34,990 [SPEAKER_5]\n Thank you. So, Brian. And then we have Brian, Paul, and Sam on Alzheimer's News. We have Biogen, earnings, some blood. These biomarker stuff.\n\n00:47:46,860 [SPEAKER_5]\n and Lily. A-beta prevention. So why don't we start with with Brian.\n\n00:47:53,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so talking about short launches. When do expectations start actually outperforming. I thought Biogen was interesting this quarter. It was really maybe one of the first quarters I remember where Lekembe actually outplayed. Pace expectations. I mean, it wasn't a mass about outpacing. It was a big outpacing if you included a one-time event in China. But even if you unwind that one-time event in China. It still did outpace expectations on a revenue side. But what I thought was more interesting commentary, and I think this goes kind of across. the class, right? Lekembe has been a really huge disappointment relative to where expectations were maybe five years ago for something like an Adjikani map. And I do think like a lot of the controversy. around the aducanumab approval has sort of weighed on these next anti-amyloid therapies that have been approved. But there's certainly a lot of hurdles to getting patients on therapy. And one of the things that's really been a big hurdle. is getting patients diagnosed and with a positive.\n\n00:48:59,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, Uh, Pat.","char_start":46220,"char_end":50181,"start_time":"00:45:34","end_time":null}

And we're sort of seeing a lot of usage of blood-based biomarkers right now to sort of Okay. go through a decision tree as to whether or not a patient with maybe mild cognitive impairment should go on for a PET or not and sort of exclude that. And one of the comments that Biogen had was, 'That they've sort of seen the blood-based biomarkers increase threefold over the last year.' So I think that's an interesting consideration. And I know Sam has some comments. Off of Roche's presentations as well. But I think we're really starting to see the emergence of these, you know, much more easy tests, which ultimately may wind up being the primary mode of diagnosing Alzheimer's and getting around PET altogether. 'Yes, I mean, there's not really much to add.'\n\n00:50:07,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, that was a preclinical story that came through, and Roche is still sticking its – call us to the mass with regards to the uh trantinimab uh brain shuttle etc so um And, you know, I agree with Brian that it's been interesting to watch this. I mean, these were the class of drugs that in the end they didn't really pass muster with regards to the clinical data they've been seeing. So I think there's quite a lot of that playing out here. But Russia's progress quickly into much earlier stage Alzheimer's is quite telling. And let's not forget that they're also a company that knows all about diagnostics. um I'm hoping that that is one of the that is a good signal going forward.\n\n00:50:51,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, maybe I'll just add, like, I think at this point, you know, like, if In the absence of any more clinical data, it feels like this could be a slow grind. And, you know, who knows, maybe Lekembe ends up getting to be a couple billion-dollar drug someday. When we talk to different neurologist practices, right? I mean, I still think the growth here is fairly linear and it's because of diagnosis, but it's also just because of capacity, right? And Biogen has said over and over that one of the rate-limiting features of this launch has been. Thank you. Getting people to see a neurologist, which is kind of like conceptually wild, right? So, you know, I think the interesting readout that we're going to get is in some time, likely in the next year, and maybe sooner if we get an interim analysis that's positive, is from this Lilia Head study. That people are calling an Alzheimer's prevention trial. The truth is a little bit more equivocal, right? Because these patients are kind of at that sort of early, really tipping point, pre-symptomatic stage.\n\n00:51:44,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n But if that study works, you know, I think there's an argument that for patients who don't actually yet have Alzheimer's, the level of motivation for seeking a treatment to prevent it might be somewhat different than someone who's already already somewhat symptomatic and they're being told that the drug is not going to make them any better. And, you know, that patient psychology question is really centered around like the debate on this. Study and is this study going to actually really increase the use of these drugs? Could it transform them? Could it just have a marginal impact? But I mean, I guess, Brian, like the one issue we still have. With that study and even these blood-based biomarkers when we think about scaling this to a broader population is: if you look at the Lilly trial, the screen failure rate is still like 85% to 90%, right? So that shows that, like, even people who are seeking out this study who think that they could be a candidate the vast majority of the time that they're not. So I just like wonder if that's really still going to be viable in the real world. How are we going to implement these tests? Where they're going to be, are they really going to be in like primary care, like, and if it all still comes down to referral to a neurologist, because the ARIA monitoring and things like that, like.","char_start":49881,"char_end":54360,"start_time":"00:48:59","end_time":null}

I know Henry was originally going to run Spinco. Now he's running the parent. Matt, you've been following this story.\n\n00:53:15,850 [SPEAKER_6]\n I have actually talked about it on here before, and I just think it's, again, one of these examples of long-term laws of unintended consequence where you've got a story that had a very specific meaning under its prior incarnation, and then, uh, when one left and was forgotten, and the other sort of original compounds kind of blew up, you wound up with this no man's land. And now they've been going through a series of iterations to try and reboot the story. And the thing that happened last week is there was a. a further modest renegotiation of the Gilead pact and some team changes there to try to clean things up and maybe make it easier to sell the cell therapy company that was originally going to be spun out and is not going to be spun out. Look, my take on this from the outside remains what it has been, which is: There's an awful lot of capital there. There's some smart people around the story as investors and so on, but that until the economic arrangement and framework with Gilead is truly sorted out. You have a box of cash that has some really complicated encumbrances on it. And I think it's going to continue to flap in the breeze a little bit until some of that stuff gets settled.\n\n00:54:17,230 [SPEAKER_6]\n Now, Galapagos has a lot of A lot of say in the matter, because I think most of the complicated entanglements with Gilead have sunsets. In the next few years and so I think we'll see that we'll see that play out over time.\n\n00:54:29,340 [SPEAKER_5]\n Great. Well, we're almost at time, so let's go around. Usually we start the show talking about biotech sentiment, capital markets, et cetera. Let's end the show talking about that. We'll start with Brad.\n\n00:54:41,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I would just say, like, I feel like we've all been in like a bad mood for a long time. And I would just say that, like, if you take a step back, like. Things are going really well lately. Like, how many clinical trial results have there been over the last three or four weeks? We've seen companies literally quadruple or quintuple.\n\n00:55:04,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, you're talking about Alnylam earlier. I mean, they crossed the $50 billion market cap. That's a major achievement for our industry. Goes to show that if you have really great science, it doesn't happen overnight, but you can build something that's really big and impressive. And a lot of drug launches are going well. Like, how about Madrigal being in a position to be buying stuff? Their launch is going so well. So I think we're getting caught up on a lot of the, like, the cleanup from the COVID bubble, like the stuff that shouldn't exist. And, you know, a lot of that's like weighing down the XBI, but I would say, like. Especially lately, the last few months, it feels like the news flow has been pretty good. So I would say.\n\n00:55:54,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, we should we should be pretty optimistic lately.\n\n00:55:58,530 [SPEAKER_7]\n Yeah.\n\n00:55:59,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Josh?\n\n00:56:01,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Still a lot of risk out there. The one thing I'd say is that at least from the investment perspective, you can't rely on the same investment practice or approach.\n\n00:56:12,100 [SPEAKER_4]\n irrespective of the broader context, whether it's macroeconomic, regulatory, or China innovation.\n\n00:56:20,330 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think that's kind of the fun of what we do is we're always trying to figure out what is the right investment strategy in the moment.

One of the things I want to just kind of call back to is the commentary about the drug launch outperformance. Sort of have this overarching thesis that a big part of the cycles that we go through are sort of how expectations build, right? I mean, and there's this chicken versus the egg argument, like, do people you know, dry valuations? Higher and that. By trying to catch up with valuation and to necessitate higher valuation, you just have higher expectations of launches. Um and then, as things sort of blow up and valuations go down, your expectations just go down along with them. And you know, I think sort of the last big bear market that there were a lot of regulatory issues and short launch was just commonly stated a great thesis in sort of late the, you know, the 2008, 2000. 11 era. And, you know, what you saw then is you saw massive outperformances over expectations. You saw launches of drugs like Tecfidera, Ilea, Sovaldi, you know, things that wound up being, you know, three, four, five times bigger than what people were modeling.\n\n00:57:40,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think it was because the sector was so depressed. People were just being really conservative. And I think you see the same things with clinical trial outcomes these days. You see catalysts that can lead to 200, 300, 400 percent. moves because the valuations have been so depressed. So I take that as a positive look. The whole sector always trades on risk and reward. And, you know, I think what we're seeing now is. the reward relative to valuations has become profoundly higher. Arguably, there's a little more risk, certainly. There's a lot of regulatory concerns. Government concerns. But, you know, you're seeing some really big upside moves that I think should bring interest back to the sector.\n\n00:58:27,090 [SPEAKER_5]\n Well, the three of you have been consistently, like I think more, not pessimistic, but less optimistic than most. So I find your comments to be really reassuring. Let's go to Paul, Sam, and then Matt, you can close out the room.\n\n00:58:42,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, not much to add. I mean, it feels like the risk on piece is definitely.\n\n00:58:48,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's definitely like emerging, right? We're seeing more financings. Stocks have been trading better on data. So not much to add. But, you know, outside of this kind of MFN lingering, it feels like the market's in a much more healthy place for the SEC.\n\n00:59:02,970 [SPEAKER_5]\n Okay, Sam, and then Matt's going to close it out.\n\n00:59:04,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I love hearing this because at heart I'm a biotech analyst, but we did have the opposite stories, right? Just that we can farm a land with, you know, we're not just cutting it.\n\n00:59:16,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sales growth for the year by a half, 14% down to 7%. That's a launch that's not going as well, but that's because their lunch is being eaten by compounders.\n\n00:59:27,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n And competition from a very good drug from Lilly. So PharmaLand hasn't been as great this week, but Biotech, I'm really excited. And when Josh is happy, I get happy.

It's been so sort of whiplashy. I think there's just like some really exciting fundamental changes happening, right? Biotech companies launching products well because the M &A climate has changed, so they haven't been bought. As clinical stage companies, I think it's like a great development. People finding, like, actual business models. I think it's going to turn out eventually. Good. However, the China dynamics play out. But like, new parts of the industry are going to be commoditized and it's going to lead to like interesting developments in other parts of the industry and I'm just like excited to see that play out and I think so much of what we're watching is the early or middle stages of some of that transformation.\n\n01:00:29,250 [SPEAKER_6]\n It's complicated, but it's fun to be part of.\n\n01:00:32,070 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah.

A live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry. With a group of biotech insiders. I'm Grace Colon, and my co-hosts today are Eric Schmidt, John Maragonori, Paul Matisse, and Bruce Booth. For more information on our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent.\n\n00:00:22,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n Once again this week, lots going on, especially on the policy side. So why don't we jump right in with one of the big, shocking, maybe not so shocking. pieces this week, which was the cancellation by HHS of major barter projects related to mRNA vaccines. 22 projects and $500 million in total. John, I know you had some comments on this.\n\n00:00:43,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Should we start, maybe, with the other news and then on the benefit and tariffs, Prasad, and then we'll go back to John on the BARDA stuff?\n\n00:00:51,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's a great point. Why don't we jump to the other policy issue, which was a lot going on on tariffs and MFN. After the initial announcement in May.\n\n00:01:01,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n about MFN. um That move was lambasted. There was a lot of warnings about what it would do to the industry. And the news continued. I mean, there was estimates that this would have a $1 trillion impact to the industry. Last year, there was a trade deal announced between the US and the EU. including a 15% tariff on pharma. But then this week, oh, and of course, last week, there were the letters sent to top pharma and biotech companies about MFN. And then this week, President Trump said pharmaceutical tariffs will be announced as soon as next week and could reach up to 250 percent. After the next year and a half.\n\n00:01:44,149 [SPEAKER_3]\n So, Paul, please help us understand all of this.\n\n00:01:48,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure. I mean, I think the short answer is that there's still a very, very wide range of potential outcomes here. I mean, I think we all know, like, if taken literally, right, taken 250% or. Taken to a scenario where companies have to just give Medicaid the lowest net price they get across a collection of countries that, I mean, this is just objectively bad for the industry. And I think Eric would agree that, you know, these worst-case scenarios are nowhere near pricing the stocks. Right. So I think like. But I think the flip side of this is that, you know, if we learned anything from all of the other tariffs, is that what we have here still looks probably like it's negotiation tactic. And that this is a first offer that might be more draconian. And ultimately, you know, pharma is going to have to farm and buy if they're going to give up something. But how much they're going to have to give up remains sort of, I think, open for debate or open for us to see.\n\n00:02:48,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n So to see the tariff piece, I think, is the harder one to kind of value into companies. And I've been surprised by the number of companies I cover who say that. Tariffs would have very, very little impact on them, even companies that have key parts of their supply chain outside of the US. And I'm not an accountant, but I have to believe that there are some really, really smart lawyers and accountants that are kind of working on ways that you can maybe play around with pogs or transfer price or things like that to kind of mitigate the impact. And I think that that's kind of what certain companies are. are alluding to. And so I guess what I'm trying to say is I feel like on the On the tariff side, just from talking to some of my companies, as an analyst, I guess I'm, at least I face it, I'm maybe a little bit less worried about that, especially if the number comes closer to something like what we saw in this EU deal, for example. On the MFN side, I mean, I think that that is the far scarier thing here for the sector. Thank you. Uh, but still a wide range of outcomes.","char_start":0,"char_end":3903,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Uh, but still a wide range of outcomes.\n\n00:03:48,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n Right and maybe this ends up like the IRA, where it's a few drugs at first. Maybe this ends up being for you know, newly launched drugs, which in some ways might actually pros and cons. Right, I mean, because I and again, I'm thinking about this purely from a pricing power perspective, not from a public health perspective. I think that's a separate topic. So purely from a stock perspective, right? I mean, I think there's a lot of ways this could play out here, and I guess I'm a little nervous because I don't feel like, you know, this has been weighing on the XBI as much as it could be. You know, I think a lot of people are just kind of almost jaded at this point to the Trump news cycle.\n\n00:04:21,050 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, again, wide range of outcomes. I would love other people's perspective.\n\n00:04:28,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'll jump in. I generally agree with everything Paul said and, in particular, think that it's MFN and less so tariffs that are the industry's sore spot right now. You know, on tariffs, we kind of got conflicting news. On the one hand, I think Trump was on CNBC and talked to Squawk Box about how he's really got pharma in his sights, and he's hoping potentially the tariffs could reach as high as 250%.\n\n00:04:54,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n But that's probably a lot of bluster. It's probably you know a way to leverage the pharmaceutical industry toward his goal of reducing drugs and maybe even, you know, having them play a little bit more on the MFN side.\n\n00:05:07,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I totally agree with Paul. I think the accountants have already figured out how to game the system with regard to tariffs, such that they can import drugs. Price points in their supply chain that are relatively modest and low and therefore have relatively modest and low tariffs on those importations and then subsequently either fill, finish, or do other things in the United States to to maximize the sales price and the step-up potential and get around those tariffs. But the other thing that happened this week was that Trump also suggested he could exempt some of the technology companies from tariffs. 100% of chip tariffs might be exempt, for example. Don't know quite what's going on there, and certainly I'm not a tech analyst, but I know some of my colleagues in Pharma Land have thought that. You know, maybe if chips and semiconductors can be exempt from some of this, pharma can get an exemption too. My suspicion, my strong suspicion is that would only happen if. the industry maybe comes to the table a little bit more and strikes a deal on MFN.\n\n00:06:13,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n We did hear from multiple large pharma companies that have reported earnings in the last week or two that they are having those types of negotiation discussions with the administration. So we'll just have to see where that lands.\n\n00:06:25,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n Eric, should we talk about this? Prasad news and the continued FDA saga. You kick it off. Yeah.\n\n00:06:34,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. Well, I guess the other topic we had out of Washington this week was. Around the seemingly strange possibility that Dr. Prasad might make a comeback. This came from an HHS interview around the Maha efforts to revolutionize healthcare.\n\n00:06:54,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n I guess Dr. Macari was asked by.","char_start":3605,"char_end":7218,"start_time":"00:03:48","end_time":null}

And Dr. Macari quickly came to the defense of his friend, which was nice to see. He suggested that Dr. Prasad was not at all pushed out, that it was Dr. Prasad's decision to leave the FDA and leave CBER. And then some of the other media reports we've seen around the Maha efforts to move him aside might not be true. And then what I think really caught our attention, Paul, was that Dr. Macari went even further and said that he's in almost daily conversations with Dr. Prasad and has invited Dr. Prasad to come back to the agency. is trying to convince them to do just that. So that's the news from earlier in the week. I was honestly flabbergasted. By the statement that you know there's a an avenue back potentially for Dr. Prasad, I know that Dr. Macari and Prasad are good friends and that I'm sure, you know, Dr. Macari feels the loss of his partner at the FDA.\n\n00:08:05,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n But, you know, for everyone's sake, I can't imagine that would be a good turn of events. But Paul, your thoughts?\n\n00:08:12,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think, like, you know, whatever you think of Dr. Prasad, right, given the controversy with him at the FDA, you know, internally with some of the stuff he had said about the FDA and then.\n\n00:08:23,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n Externally, it feels like if he left because he was worried about, you know, himself as a distraction. I mean, that's the way it's been described, right? I mean, this would just create, I feel like a much, much. much, much bigger distraction. And I feel like it just would be so, it'd be tough on any organization, right? To kind of have, you have this huge change in leadership and philosophy. And then you have one leave and then now come back. I mean, and then, you know, we're going to be kind of talking about, you know, companies now. And hey, when was your meeting with the FDA? Was it during the first tenure facade or the second? Like, I just feel like it would be just make like make our jobs too complicated. And already, I think it's hard, you know, as an analyst or an investor to be right more than. more than 50% of the time. You know, we were having a conversation internally like this week with one of my colleagues at Stiefel and just like, whether, like, whether, you know, So Prasad really was that much more strict, you know, because I think like that had obviously been the narrative, right? That historically, with just everything he had said on social media, this guy's going to be so much tougher in industry. And then, you know, like you were talking about last week, Eric, right?\n\n00:09:26,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n We saw the ultragenic CRL, Replamune.\n\n00:09:30,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I'm forgetting what, oh, Capricorn too. But I guess, like, I do still feel like the jury on what the Prasad-Sieber look like was still sorted out, right? I mean, we had this article, and you're closer to repping me than I am, Eric, around, you know, how maybe it wasn't Prasad at all who drove that CRM. You know, the Capricor situation, I wonder if that was something that might have been pushing the FDA flexibility side, you know, maybe farther than usual, right, without opining as much on that. Um, on that company or stock, like you know, just that was, you know, maybe a little bit less traditional of, like, a mechanism and a data set, and then with Ultragenics, right, we had something related to manufacturing. So I actually still feel like a lot of my companies in the rare and gene therapy space still felt, when Prasad was at the FDA, that their dialogue and getting things like breakthrough or pivotal trial signups, none of that had changed.\n\n00:10:23,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I think if he came back, it feels like it would be such a big distraction. And I think the hope is we get someone who's maybe a little bit more down the middle.\n\n00:10:34,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n But you know, I feel like it's kind of It's kind of unpredictable.

I mean, I think what you're sort of anchoring around is— and I don't put words in your mouth. Fall but you know, it's it's hard to know whether, from a review standpoint, Dr. Prasad was good, bad, or indifferent. Did he really come down harder or easier on reviews? I don't know. I'm not sure. We'll never know. But I think one thing that we did see was a little bit more drama, for sure. And a little bit more unpredictability in his 84 days at CBER. And it just seems to me that we need to kind of return to normalcy, right? We need almost like a little bit of a healing at the FDA. And hopefully, stabilizing at the FDA. We've talked about how potentially Dr. Prasad and Dr. Macari are more externally oriented than internally oriented managers. But yeah, I do hope that whoever comes and takes his place, it sounds like George Tidmarsh for now is going to be filling in, at least temporarily, Seaver's roles. I hope that person can bring more of a uh— an expertise in in in organizational leadership, some maybe a common presence, even it seems like Dr. Tidmarsh might be just that person, given his past.\n\n00:11:55,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n And yeah, I mean, we just need the review staff to do their job, right? This day and age, where it comes down to a single personality. Whether that's Dr. Prasad at CBER or you alluded to the replimune situation and some thoughts that. You know, maybe ODAC leadership, sorry, the Oncology Drug Committee leadership was relevant there. Were you surprised by that?\n\n00:12:16,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're like a lot closer to the Onc space than I am.\n\n00:12:20,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, you know, if the reports are true and Stat News has done a great job here, I have no doubt, I have no reason to doubt that they're not true. Dr. Prasad was in all these discussions, right? So, and it is CBER that sent the review letter to reprimand the CRL. So everything I've seen about Dr. Prasad tells me he is someone who wants to grab the microphone or the pen and make decisions and not be a fly on the wall. So suggesting that Dr. Pazder was the one who did that application, and honestly, you know, that's probably semantics more than anything else. I think that has, or probably does, have a view, and, you know, knowing what the oncology drug division has done historically. Probably quite consistent with Pazder's views that they thought the trial design here may not have been optimal. But at the end of the day, this was done on Dr. Prasad's CBRN watch. The review was done by CBRN. I've got to think that if Dr. Prasad had wanted the drug approved, he would have done it, and if he didn't want the drug approved.\n\n00:13:23,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n He would have sent the CRO, which is obviously what happened.\n\n00:13:27,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Fair enough.\n\n00:13:29,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, I mean, I'm not— you know, I think that makes sense, like I.\n\n00:13:34,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n And look, again, I don't doubt stat either. I mean, stat, I think, is my best. It's better than any expert network we could have right now on just what's actually going on at the FDA and on the policy side. But, you know, like with anything, right, like you never know who.\n\n00:13:48,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n The sources or who's saying what and why and—you know, I just think, yeah, I think, again, the jury was still out, right, on what Prasad's CBER might have looked like. And I think, probably, at least from a stock perspective.\n\n00:14:00,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hopefully we don't get to rerun this hypothetical back twice because it feels like that would be pretty destabilizing for the market.\n\n00:14:08,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n So before we leave the FDA, Paul, I guess we ought to talk about uh some news either you know from late last week on Regeneron and then this week it bled into Scholar Rock, but both cases we've had some CRLs, one issued and maybe one in the future threatening to be issued. Around. Some manufacturing considerations. Are you close to those two?\n\n00:14:29,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n Not really, but like, I think.","char_start":11093,"char_end":15499,"start_time":"00:10:34","end_time":null}

Like, how do we actually get kind of a sense or a true gut check on whether or not the FDA is actually being more conservative? I mean, sometimes there's like these overt scenarios, but I always feel like with this kind of stuff. There's like so much level of like informational asymmetry. And, you know, it's like a little bit like who said what, but you cover Scholar Rock. Like, do you feel like there's actually something here that is eyebrow raising and we should all be thinking about?\n\n00:15:07,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, yeah, so hard to have perfect visibility. And honestly, having spoken to Scholar Rock, they themselves at this stage, I don't think have particularly good visibility on how this is going to play out.\n\n00:15:19,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n Our listeners who are maybe less familiar, maybe we should take a step back here. The reason that Regeneron and Scholar Rock are connected is that both have programs under review. That were being filled and finished. CMC programs are being filled and finished by a facility that used to be owned by Catalan and now is owned by Novo. This facility is based in Indianapolis. And that facility has been a troublesome facility for a long time.\n\n00:15:48,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n 4883 letters going back now several years.\n\n00:15:52,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n Observations that just seemingly have not been remedied. As far as I understand it, one of the leverage points that the FDA has to force an owner to remedy at facility is by not approving new drugs through that facility. The Catalan now Novo facility, it can ship drugs and is shipping drugs on a regular day-to-day basis. Products are coming out of that facility and being sent to patients. The issues are not seemingly related to drug safety or drug purity or contamination issues. There are other issues, probably. You know, a variety of other issues, but things that we don't fully understand and know about. So products are leaving the facility, but when it comes to approving a new drug that's being finished at this facility, the FDA is really able to throw down the hammer. And is able to you know force uh the owner of the facility to to make corrections and and that's exactly the situation unfortunately that both Regeneron and and Scholar Rock find themselves in.\n\n00:16:54,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n I feel for them because They're really kind of caught in the middle. They obviously don't own and control the facility and they're to some extent. uh at the uh really uh Thank you.\n\n00:17:08,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n completely dependent upon Novo to fix its issues.\n\n00:17:13,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n We had a CRL issue to regenerate, I guess, two CRLs last week. And this week, Scarlet Rock.\n\n00:17:20,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n Made the very transparent statement to its investors. That it may also have problems at the same facility. Yeah, good question. Paul, I, I don't, you know, I don't think we, we understand how we can possibly calibrate the severity of this concern right now. The good news from Spaniel Rock is: Their drug is seemingly approvable from a safety and efficacy standpoint. The drug obviously affects kids. You serve. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Very severe disease, and I would hope that you know, the FDA might err on the side of providing access to you know, a potentially game-saving drug for patients in great unmet needs. So we're hopeful. Their PDUFA date isn't until September 22nd. Maybe there's time to remedy the situation or. or to have some kind of alternative process.\n\n00:18:13,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Interesting. Okay.\n\n00:18:14,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n Something to watch. Before we move on with like policy stuff and start talking about companies, do you want to just briefly talk about the BARDA topic that you proposed?\n\n00:18:21,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, I don't think anybody's surprised that our HHS secretary is not particularly enthusiastic about vaccines.\n\n00:18:31,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n And we don't have to go into the merits of that, although I think, you know, most of us.","char_start":15199,"char_end":19694,"start_time":"00:14:29","end_time":null}

But I mean, the BARDA decision to basically cut the knees off of quite a bit of funding is really unfortunate because you know, the mRNA platform, you know, is really something which I think everybody acknowledges was fundamental in, you know, helping us get out of the pandemic. And, you know, we're not done with pandemics or emerging threats.\n\n00:19:09,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, even epidemics that could be, you know, could be challenging for society. And so, you know, to to to you know not need to invest in that platform as a rapid response mechanism through BARDA. Obviously, there are companies that independently. Do do work in the space but you know Barda BARDA should be active in terms of the public. health. funding aspects of that platform. It's concerning. It's concerning. And, you know, unfortunately, I don't think things will change on that front until, you know. you know there are changes um you know a philosophy there but um you know other countries may begin to get stronger in those spaces with mRNA vaccines which would put us at a disadvantage from a national security perspective. So, you know, I think it's a concerning change.\n\n00:20:07,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm sure Bayo is doing what it can on this topic, but we're dealing with a set of views here that we all recognize are very firm— albeit misguided.\n\n00:20:21,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n John, can I just mention an interesting personal anecdote that is somewhat related to this? So my wife and I, we just had our second child about a month ago.\n\n00:20:33,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n And in the hospital, right, like when your child is born, right, they offer you the hepatitis B vaccine. And just the approach to offering that was different this time. I mean, we were checked on three times in sort of an 'are you sure' dynamic.\n\n00:20:49,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n You can almost get the sense that at the institution level, they're so worried about doing something that someone then freaks out about later. From a vaccine perspective, right? Like this is just kind of a default medical decision, generally in newborns. And then, in talking to our pediatrician, she was so psyched that we'd actually done it because I'd been seeing a lot of families who hadn't. And like, this is in Massachusetts, you know? So, and I have a control group, right? Which is, especially when my son was born almost four years ago. Like, none of this in the acute setting was even remotely a dialogue, right? So I thought that was, you know, again, it's a one-off thing, but it was just really interesting how you can see the attitude being so different three to four years later.\n\n00:21:32,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, you know, there was a fascinating interview this past week between Matt Herper and Bill Gates, where Gates, you know, has commented on even the global emergence of vaccine hesitancy and the implications of that on, you know, broader aspects of global public health. So, yeah, this stuff has ripple effects that are profound and absolutely, you know, contradictory. To ensuring a healthy society. You know, definitely far from Maha, I would say. So it is unfortunate. And, you know, Paul, what you're—counting there is really telling about a broader sentiment that's emerging and gaining a lot of traction, and not just here in the country, but globally. So it is a point of concern.\n\n00:22:28,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, love the personal anecdote, Paul. Thank you for sharing. I mean, I guess just one. Added comment for me is just the stark. irony here. Um, how you know how we could change so much in in five years? There was a press report out this week saying that Donald Trump had been nominated, I think, by Cambodia for a Nobel Peace Prize and the basis, believe it or not, of that nomination was Operation Warp Speed and the terrific job that the Trump administration had done. To bring mRNA vaccines to the world on a record timeline. And distribute them effectively.","char_start":19394,"char_end":23687,"start_time":"00:18:21","end_time":null}

And I believe that the Trump administration deserves a lot of credit for that. They do. Yet somehow, yeah, somehow we got so wrapped around the axle. politically, I guess, you know, politics just came in. and completely took over this debate, which should always have been a scientific debate. uh and now made it such that you know we've got antagonizing sides on on both sides of the aisle and it's a battle zone and the science unfortunately has taken a huge back seat in all of this and And I guess that's just a comment of what we're left with with society today. I know there are a lot of scientists on this call and a lot of scientists listening in. We can all just hope that we can get back to a day and age when science gets to lead and not follow the politics.\n\n00:24:00,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, maybe we need Laura Loomer to intervene here to sort of help educate the subversion of Trump 1. 0 vis-a-vis Operation Warp Speed, because I, you know, I do think I'm joking, but I do think, you know. Trump administration 1. 0 deserves a huge amount of credit with OWS. And a big part of that was mRNA vaccines. So it does seem counter to a step forward that was missed. Materialize during that time and that crisis.\n\n00:24:30,540 [SPEAKER_6]\n So it's unfortunate.\n\n00:24:38,950 [SPEAKER_6]\n Should we move on and talk about some company news?\n\n00:24:43,190 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe I can start with Vertex and then Eric, you can do Agios. And then, if we have time, I can do Praxis too. Does that sound good?\n\n00:24:53,640 [SPEAKER_6]\n Let's do absolutely serving to hear me.\n\n00:24:55,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Thank you. Yeah, so this week, Vertex, there's a broader conversation here, too, about sort of love stocks. And I actually want to ask Eric after this just if he can think about it. Analogous to this in the large-cap biotech but you know— for everyone in the call, right? I'm sure everyone knows Vertex well. But from an investor perspective, I mean, this has been a a love stock for years now, based on just the perceived scarcity, value, of a company with a 10 billion-plus dollar drug franchise in cystic fibrosis, which is very hard-margin, with no real imminent competitors, and then separately, a pipeline, and doing real drug development. An impressive scientific team and a lot of different shots on goal. And so, the most compelling shot and goal there has been their pain portfolio of sodium channel modulators, which you know— in a dream case— could be applicable to a wide array of pain ideologies, with no real abuse potential, because they work on the transmission of pain and not the physiological or neurological.\n\n00:25:49,149 [SPEAKER_1]\n The setback this week, though, is as the acute launch or the hospital launch for their drug, not just in the hospital, but sort of a hospital outpatient care. setting has gone okay. It's gone decently, but it's slow. It's a market they have to build. They had a setback for their next generation pain product, which failed in a trial. was discontinued. And they also had a meeting with the FDA where they were trying to pursue a path in chronic pain to a broad indication for neuropathic pain. And the FDA—FDA— basically said the door wasn't open for that on just kind of looking at a couple of specific indications and generalizing. And I think the interesting sort of takeaways here are: a few things. One, I actually feel like before these earnings, there wasn't really a lot of credit in Vertex's stock for that broad. pain dynamic just because one of the studies that that was based on, LSR sciatica, actually failed, right? So this was a disappointment on the FDA feedback. On the other hand, though the data was never actually that overwhelmingly positive that supported it in the first place, and investors knew that.","char_start":23387,"char_end":27544,"start_time":"00:23:10","end_time":null}

So this was a disappointment on the FDA feedback. On the other hand, though the data was never actually that overwhelmingly positive that supported it in the first place, and investors knew that.\n\n00:26:53,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n The second piece is that this second generation drug that failed in a Again, it's another thing where was there really anything explicit there in investors' models? Not totally clear, right? I mean, I think the debate around the acute product and pain was less about efficacy and more about just— can you build that market?\n\n00:27:12,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n But, you know, I feel like this is a scenario of a company that has had this. halo effect and has been remarkably resilient for a number of years, where they had this failure in Alpha 180 trips and deficiency stock traded off a lot. Really came back again on that scarcity value thesis failure and pain last year in LSR Sciatica. The stock went below $400, came back to almost the high 400s. And I think the interesting sort of conversation here is, you know, when and how do these special companies kind of get that? halo effect that buoys the stock removed? And what does it take? I mean, the other nuance here was that they did not raise their revenue guidance for the first time in multiple years. On that, in the second quarter, Paul. So I think there's some concern that maybe the cystic fibrosis business is getting to a more predictable phase. But, you know, I've always kind of felt like the valuation with Vertex and, you know, Jehovah talked about Al Malam, valuation with Al Malam to some degree, can be more subjective than other big cap companies because it's been one of the unique companies with this sort of feasible.\n\n00:28:17,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Blue sky case.\n\n00:28:19,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n And when that kind of went away, I think more firmly on pain, you saw a much bigger reaction in the stock down over 20% than I think almost anyone would have anticipated. And so, it's an interesting situation here. There's nothing really imminent to reconcile it, but I'd love to get others' perspective either on Vertex or just how we should kind of think about the implications for For companies and stock sentiment in general.\n\n00:28:45,950 [SPEAKER_5]\n Go ahead, John.\n\n00:28:46,909 [SPEAKER_0]\n Eric, you should, you know, you start. No, please go.\n\n00:28:50,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, Vertex is such a great company. But, you know, I think there's always a struggle when, you know, I mean, they propelled, obviously. Remarkably on CF.\n\n00:29:02,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, everybody wants to see Act 2, you know, just like with Regeneron, obviously, ILEA, but then Dupixent and And even there, there's been some pullback on Regeneron. And so investors just want to see that act two, act three that propels. Fuels future growth, you know, once you get into these high devaluations for these companies, because they're up there because of growth potential. That's true with El Milo right now. Their strengths should because of, you know, prospects for growth with Ambutra. So, but it does get challenging if you lose one of your, you know, your big winners, potential big winners, like, you know, people are fearing with the Pain franchise.\n\n00:29:49,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I don't have a ton to add here. And Paul, you're much closer to the sentiment and the stock dynamics on Vertex than I am. Um, You know, what's interesting actually is that both the Pain franchise and the CF franchise originated from the same source within Vertex. John, I know you're old enough to remember the acquisition they did back in 2001 of Aurora Biosciences, but that was where all these ion channels started.\n\n00:30:17,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, what a great acquisition that was. I think it was about a $600 million acquisition.\n\n00:30:21,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. They got the CF franchise. Well, if you're looking for a halo effect, there's nothing better than a CF franchise. They're just so dominant in this space.\n\n00:30:32,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's hard to imagine that there's a more valuable franchise almost anywhere in biotech these days.\n\n00:30:38,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, and it's going to last a little bit longer.

Right. So the good news is there's no real urgency.\n\n00:30:44,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n But. But certainly they do need another. And Pain is tough, as much as we need new pain drugs. Um, there's don't seem to be that potent. Paul. I mean, I guess that's my, my read from all of this. Yes, we've seen. failures before.\n\n00:30:59,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Just doesn't seem like. This mechanism packs the punch needed to really be a major player.\n\n00:31:06,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n Of course, we've seen paint launches before to know that they're very, very slow and gradual if they ever take off.\n\n00:31:13,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n Maybe, you know, maybe this is a major transition point in vertexes.\n\n00:31:19,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n progress and strategy, and maybe they need to think about something else. I don't know.\n\n00:31:23,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think, like, what's really interesting with how they've worked on pain and, you know, even some of the work they've done in other things like AT, right? And you can't blame them for this, right? But they've really leveraged, in my view, like the cystic fibrosis approach, you know, these sort of targeted proof of concept studies, you know, betting on the science, you know, betting on early successes that they're going to continue.\n\n00:31:46,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm biased, right, because I've covered a lot of these small neuro companies and I've been on the wrong side of things that have blown up on incredible phase two data. I just feel like you can't do that in neurology.\n\n00:31:59,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, and if it were up to me, and caveat being I've never developed a drug or got a drug approved, if I was running that program, there'd be five phase two studies ongoing right now across a whole array of different pain etiologies and migraine. And any indication that was advanced to phase three would have three studies only when we need two. Because I think that's just like the way you have to do things in neuroscience. I mean, Prozac's the poster child, right? One of the top selling antidepressants ever failed at more trials than it worked in. I don't think pain is any different. And so I do wonder if part of the setback was that, you know, Vertex is, you know, they deserve all the credit in the world for their innovation engine, but it feels like the CF philosophy was applied to a disease area where you just can't do that. Like the endpoints are not, are really, really tough. There's no biomarkers. Patients are heterogeneous. And so, yeah, and I mean, now they're. Back to the drawing board, they're in phase three in DPN, but it feels like the program itself could be revamped.\n\n00:32:55,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n John, we can't leave this topic of valuable franchises without having you take a little bit of a victory lap on Alnylon and Ambutra. So go ahead. I'll tee up for you.\n\n00:33:05,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I couldn't be there last week when, you know, last Hangout, last Friday, which would have been more pertinent from a timing standpoint. But, you know, it's— just wonderful to see Hal Milam report the second quarter results, and Ambutra's on a rip. I mean, it's just, it's looking fantastic, and it's just that the beginning. So I'm super proud of the team there and what they're doing and where they're going. I have a tradition of opening up a nice bottle of champagne for every $50 Alnylam share price. And I managed to cover two bottles last week. So, you know, I'm still still dragging a little bit this week as a result of it. But it's it's a real credit to the team over there and so forth. You know, look, I think. The interesting thing, it gets back to the Vertex story and Regeneron as well, you know, cost or threshold value, you know, it really is driven by, you know, a mega product or franchise opportunity, CF, Filia, Dupix.\n\n00:34:11,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, you know, to really for Al-Nilem to get to the next horizon of 100 billion, which I expect it will.","char_start":31315,"char_end":35489,"start_time":"00:30:32","end_time":null}

Good news is, it's um and the interest thing for all these companies, you know, Vertex maybe less so, but certainly for Regeneron and LNILM. I mean, these are companies that are sporting, you know, their own innovation organically. They're largely doing it on their own as opposed to getting it from the outside. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's an interesting feature of what these companies have done over the years. Which John. Yeah.\n\n00:34:55,989 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would love to ask you a quick question. Someone covering El Milo now who misses you as the CEO, even though I love the current team too. Um. So the quarter was, you know, unbelievable, right? I mean, it blew out the sell side consensus number. Maybe that wasn't a real number, but, you know. Some people were pointing to Acuvia data that pointed to $420 million. It was so much more than that. You know, if you're running El Milo in that situation, how do you balance, you know, conveying confidence going forward that this is not? a one-off bolus of patients.\n\n00:35:30,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n But also you don't want the numbers and the expectations to get out of hand.\n\n00:35:36,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, you know, I just thought it was interesting, like the team.

You know, would you be if you were this still looking at the stock and thinking, 'I got to make sure this doesn't get out of hand' and we don't set up for some arbitrary disappointment in two quarters when we beat consensus by 50 million, but we had to beat it by 90. Like, do you think that way when you're in that seat?\n\n00:36:02,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n You do. I mean, you definitely try to dampen enthusiasm.\n\n00:36:08,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I mean, if you if you have a blowaway quarter result and— you know, and they certainly John, I think you muted yourself.\n\n00:36:29,290 [SPEAKER_6]\n break. Hello. Yeah, I'm back. Can you hear me now?\n\n00:36:33,630 [SPEAKER_6]\n Can you hear me now?\n\n00:36:35,530 [SPEAKER_6]\n Jesus Christ.\n\n00:36:37,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n yes we can hear you john john we can hear you All right, good.\n\n00:36:40,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sorry.\n\n00:36:41,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, what I was saying is, you know, you don't, you know, I mean, I think the important thing to do here is not. not to let expectations get too far ahead and start creating new sets of estimates that are that are not going to be met. I, you know, I think.\n\n00:36:59,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Super savvy about that. Jeff Poulton, CFO, you know, you know, Paul is really, really careful and as is a bond. And so I. I'm sure that they'll do a good job, you know, managing this trajectory. You know, it's a great, wonderful event when you have a blowaway quarter, but you definitely want to make sure that it's sustainable and, you know, obviously they have a line of sight on, you know, already. Quite a bit of Q3 performance. So I'm sure they have a good sense of where this is going.\n\n00:37:35,310 [SPEAKER_6]\n Makes sense.\n\n00:37:38,870 [SPEAKER_6]\n Eric, do you want to talk about Agios at all?\n\n00:37:42,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, we could. Do that or, uh, well. Why don't we do it quickly? I don't know if you guys have been following the the news earlier in the week. Um, the stock was very volatile on on Monday. In fact, at one point it was down over 20%.\n\n00:37:57,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n This on the heels of a cell side report that called out a potential link in the Fair Safety Database that the FDA maintains. This gets updated on a quarterly basis.\n\n00:38:09,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n And in Fair's, there were four patient reports.\n\n00:38:13,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Potential deaths linked to power kinds of proof for a small niche indication, PK deficiency, and it's in development, of course, for sickle cell disease.\n\n00:38:24,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, Multiple patient deaths were reported in PKD. And one death. It's sickle cell.","char_start":35189,"char_end":39591,"start_time":"00:34:11","end_time":null}

And one death. It's sickle cell.\n\n00:38:31,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n News of that report from Southside Analyst, again, just hammered the shares. Really caught I think the company off guard and scrambled to kind of find a response to this.\n\n00:38:43,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, fortunately, their response was was was very I would say. accurate in terms of trying to dispel the myth or the link between.\n\n00:38:56,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n affairs. deaths and their drug. Specifically, there weren't really four deaths, there were only three.\n\n00:39:03,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n And all of those three deaths had seemingly no relation to the product itself. um And in each case, there was not thought to be a link between use of the product and the desk, where CF patients have high mortality anyway.\n\n00:39:19,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n The PKD patients who died were very elderly or had underlying cancers to boot.\n\n00:39:25,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, you know, this became a fire drill. Unfortunately, it was a pretty nasty fire drill. And maybe the lesson here, the worst part of all of this, was that the company wasn't only caught flat footed with investors. We're big guys. stomach a day or two volatility, but I think it's certainly possible that this news leaked beyond the investment community into the patient community where I know the company was aiming to be very diligent in its ability to address. Most important constituents, those patients who have PKD and those patients who have sickle cell. Would have been terrible if something like this had. Persuaded patients to come off their drug prematurely or to be skeptical of product in the future. I think sometimes the investment community—um—doesn't think as much about the broader implications of what we might be writing. Paul, you're a Southside analyst. Thank you. Don't know if you might have handled this differently. I suspect you, you would have— but I think it's probably on all of us to think a little bit more carefully before we come up with conspiracy theories and make sure that we kick the tires pretty hard on anything like this or this nature that could be potentially so incendiary and potentially harmful\n\n00:40:44,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n to.

I don't know why.\n\n00:41:12,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can you hear me?\n\n00:41:14,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, we can hear you. I can't now hear Paul. John, I'm not sure you were wrapped up in the fire drill that was Adios, but again, it's nice to see the stock recover and hopefully they retain the broader issue too.\n\n00:41:27,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no, I have been following it. I used to be on the board and I'm glad things were covered. As they did.\n\n00:41:36,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n So maybe or I hope Paul's able to join. We can't hear you still. Paul, I see your off speaker but John, I know a company that You and I have followed for. A number of years, decades, uh, now, was also in the news. In Biogen, they put out a a release this week saying that they're going to start up a new venture arm— not necessarily for a straight return on investment, but maybe more for corporate purposes to get a little bit of a look under the hood.\n\n00:42:05,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n Maybe you want to walk our listeners through that and your thoughts.\n\n00:42:09,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't, I didn't, I saw the news briefly, so I didn't go through all the details. So maybe you can have some of the details. Do you want to start there? And then I can, I certainly can.\n\n00:42:18,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, I don't, yeah, I think that the details were, you know, fairly plain vanilla. Yeah. I think what we've seen from Biogen is a greater interest in resourcing external innovation versus internal innovation. I know you can comment on that. In terms of the venture group itself, they've been looking for assets from an in-licensing standpoint, from a BD standpoint now.","char_start":39291,"char_end":43550,"start_time":"00:38:13","end_time":null}

That was, I think, a meaningful change over the last three or four years. But this venture arm now will begin to invest in earlier stage companies and assets.\n\n00:42:55,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n And again, do so with an eye toward corporate priorities as opposed to return on capital priorities. I think really trying to align itself. With Biogen's remaining internal drug discovery engine, to try and get involved at an early stage in programs and products that the Biogen folks think are valuable.\n\n00:43:15,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, yeah, that's great. No, I thought, look, it's consistent with what I saw briefly too, Eric. I mean, I think Biogen is really going through a transformation. Chris has been leading it now for about a couple of years and obviously, you know, had a lot of has a lot of things to turn around for sure, because he was left. a bit of a redo, remake in many ways. It's such a great company. I used to work there for a decade back in the 80s and 90s. So it's got a really, really warm place in my heart. And Chris and his research chief, Jane Grogan, who, you know, is a terrific scientist. terrific leader. I mean, they've got a lot of work to do. They know that. And they've been doing some collaborations with companies. I mean, they partnered with City Therapeutics. The exec chair and it was really great to get them involved with that effort. They've been broadening out their effort beyond neurology to include immunology, which I think is smart. I think they probably, historically, they over-indexed on the neurospace.\n\n00:44:21,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Paul would be able to comment on that himself, but they over-indexed. In that space and made it more challenging for them to really grow as a business, but now they're going broader. So I've got, and also Rare Disease, they're interested. In augmenting their rare disease presence. So I think the venture side of it is a good move for them. You know, Chris really gets the importance of of new companies and the innovation ecosystem. I mean, he understands why larger companies can't succeed on some things that smaller companies can't. Can do. So this, I'm sure, is a nod to his own deep-felt belief in all that. And he successfully did that at Sanofi with the venture investments they did there, including some really innovative ones like WorkDrive as well. And not everything's always going to work out, but some of them will. So I think it's not a surprise that a new venture fund has been created under Chris's leadership.\n\n00:45:22,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n But I'm looking forward to seeing how they can contribute to the ecosystem here and maybe help support some new cutting-edge companies in a very, very tough private market environment out there as well. That's all good.\n\n00:45:41,200 [SPEAKER_5]\n Paul, you able to join us, rejoin us?\n\n00:45:46,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm not sure we can hear you still.\n\n00:45:50,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n And John, just coming back to your comment, how Chris inherited a little bit of a. An organization and Bye now. Yep.\n\n00:46:00,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n This room is like something's wrong with it today because my phone's totally fine, man, and I just had to leave and rejoin. I mean, Biogen, like, I think, yeah, so I agree with everything you guys said. I mean, I feel like Biogen is. Like one of your things you sent around, Eric, is like, how do they get here? It feels like it was like a combination of.\n\n00:46:19,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n strategy and capital allocation years ago and bad luck.

Everyone else was saying, 'Oh my God, if we had something for these patients, they'd be used more broadly.' I just feel like. You know, I can understand why they allocated billions of capital to those projects. Like the commercial upside always seemed like it was there. I don't think anyone anticipated how hard it would be. Maybe they should have, but I feel like it's not fair to say in hindsight that this was obvious, that these drugs would be niche, right? I understand the benefit is not huge, but no one really thought you needed a huge benefit to have a big drug in Alzheimer's.\n\n00:47:06,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n Under the prior board, right, there was maybe a different view of just valuation and M &A, and they were a lot more conservative, and they watched a lot of good neuroscience stuff get a lot more expensive over the years, like companies like Neurocrine and Acadia. The muscarinic companies. And so I think, I mean, I like Chris. Like, I think he's done a nice job. I think, you know, like people.\n\n00:47:29,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n People, a lot of investors, I think, fixate on like a deal, right? Like the Riyada deal, like was that an overpay or not? But, you know, it feels like he's doing the right things, trying to diversify the therapeutic area mix.\n\n00:47:41,319 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um and I think he has a keen understanding of what they lack and what they need.\n\n00:47:46,970 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's all right. I'd be curious, John, just, you know, again, having watched this company over decades now and having spent time there yourself when it was such a scientific powerhouse. I guess Biogen is one of the companies that failed to innovate beyond its very robust and very successful MS first-generation franchise and never Never developed that second act. Do you think it's luck or bad luck? Or do you think maybe something went wrong along the way?\n\n00:48:14,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I think, look, I think historically, the company has been challenged with dealmaking. And I think that, you know, MS was amazing and they and they hit it out of the park and and obviously built the company with MS. But, you know, there's just. you know, going all the way back to Jim Vinson, Eric, you know, there was just a very high level of reluctance to do.\n\n00:48:44,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n you know, deals in general, very conservative approach. You know, I had dinner with Adam Koppel earlier this week, who used to run corporate development at Biogen. And Adam was joking about, or I was actually teasing him about Neurocrime and that unfortunate deal that could have been a good deal for them, never materialized. And, you know, a lot of it's, you know, related to the sort of historical. Oracle board at the budget, which Chris is changing. Chris has been changing. So, you know, look, I think Chris is going to write the ship. It's going to take some time. Is going to take some time. It's super tough when you've got a, you know, basis of, you know, billions of revenues that are growing and you've got to, you know, reinvigorate, reignite. Growth in that. It's going to take a few years, or hopefully not a few years, but it's going to take more than the time that he's been there so far.

But I'm optimistic that there'll be a path forward for them.\n\n00:49:43,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hey, can I chime in real quick? Cause I want to hear Eric's perspective on something. And then John, like, it would be a lost opportunity to not hear your perspective. This. report from the Financial Times on avidity and avidity might be in play. I mean, Eric, I cover Dine, you cover avidity. I mean, I think you probably agree with me that these transferrin oligo conjugates are one of the more interesting innovative areas in Small biotech with a few indications that are big white space. I was curious, though, are you surprised by the timing? Because FSHD, their data is great, right? But there's still some. Questions around, I think, the phase three design and some of the regulatory dynamics and in DM1. I mean, I think, you know, DM1 like is not without— either company, some level of clinical and regulatory risk. It doesn't surprise me at all that these companies would be in play. They seem prime takeout targets at some point in their life cycle, but it was—earlier than I thought.\n\n00:50:36,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, I think Go ahead, John.\n\n00:50:39,959 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah.\n\n00:50:40,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n You're the RNA guy.\n\n00:50:41,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, no, no. Sure. Yeah. No, I mean, look, I think Novartis has got to, let me just maybe provide some context here. I mean, Novartis. is on a tear with RNAi, right? They made the Medco acquisition back $9. 7 billion in 2019. They or 18. They, you know, DTX was bought a couple of years ago. You know, they've done some deals out of China in RNAI. You know, they bought Regulus. So they're— They're big believers in the space. And it wouldn't surprise me that Voss, you know, now it's a rumor, so we don't know for sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if Voss saw this. Something he wanted to grab ahead of news that might make it a lot more expensive. And it's certainly a good way for, you know, the avidity shareholders and board to, you know, balance the risk/ reward here in terms of, you know, the readouts that they've got coming forward. But Eric, what do you think?\n\n00:51:39,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, like you, John, I guess I don't know what to think in terms of this— some standard ability of these rumors. But.\n\n00:51:46,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, honestly, I hope they're not true. And the reason I do is I'm a huge believer, maybe like Paul.\n\n00:51:53,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n The power of this platform, the ability to deliver RNAi to muscle and not just skeletal muscle.\n\n00:52:00,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n We're seeing potentially transform these diseases in real time, FSHD, DMD, DM1. But also potentially smooth muscle, cardiac muscle as well. Know Paul, I think like you— we do share the view that um dying and avidity could grow up to be next down island or the next vertex, really really important. Uh, company in our space. Right. And if there is a deal to be had, boy, I hope it's a huge premium because I think there's a lot of value in these businesses.\n\n00:52:31,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah, I mean there's just very few. When you look at FSHD and DM1, and, you know, DMD is still pretty open, too. I mean, there's just not that many. Rare disease markets like that that are just white space. There's just not that many, right? That could actually really move the needle for a company like Novartis. So it'd be super interesting to see what should play out.","char_start":50301,"char_end":53972,"start_time":"00:49:43","end_time":null}

For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode and for disclosures regarding the companies we cover, please go to biotechhangout.com. As a reminder, none of what we say should be construed as investment advice, because anyone who's ever tried investing in biotech knows just how very hard and volatile it can be. Tess, by the way, I caught up with the— I had a great introductory call with the RA Capital Planetary Health Team.\n\n00:00:42,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, I love that.\n\n00:00:43,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, very interesting initiative now moving beyond. biotech to invest in companies that um are good for planetary health um thinking about sustainability, energy sources, and optimization. Really, really fascinating effort. So kudos to the RA Capital team for for making that pivot and really trying to make a difference on a planetary basis. So very, very, very important. And hopefully we'll hear a lot more about that group. in the months and years to come. But we're going to kick things off now. That's not so much biotech. Let's talk about some of the latest updates, the big one. Vinay Prasad is back. Eric, good, bad? Because. N-neither?\n\n00:01:32,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, boy. Okay. Just the latest chapter in quite the saga here.\n\n00:01:37,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n Look, I guess one thing you just have to say is that Dr. Macari really, really, really wants him there, right? I mean, I think most of us felt, when he left two weeks ago, it was, for good reason, that there was just too much going on, too much chaos, too much trauma.\n\n00:01:56,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yet he's back. Um, you know, great point. A great piece from Stat News this week that, perhaps, provides some advice to Dr. Persaud on his way back to the agency on how he might able to do things with a little less trauma. So hopefully, everyone has seen that. But my take is that these two leaders are joined at the hip. Um, that, that Dr. McCurry pushed very hard and very aggressively to bring him back, despite some of the political headwinds that he may have faced. And he got his wish. So we're going to have these two guys running the agency. That's pretty clear.\n\n00:02:32,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n We can cross our fingers and hope for the best. Obviously, there's a lot of things that could potentially be at risk with regard to drug regulation and approval processes in the U.S. And we all need, I think, to get behind these two and hope they can do the job as best they can and maybe support them. So good, bad, indifferent, Josh? I don't know. I mean, I think we both feel that. That these two individuals are really, really bright and really capable.\n\n00:02:59,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n And certainly engaged.\n\n00:03:02,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n I hope that they've learned a few lessons in their first six months on the job. And like all of us, they can get better at it.\n\n00:03:10,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, Tess, what do you think? And how are you at RA Capital, like, if at all? Reacting to some of the leadership changes at the FDA as you think about your investments and portfolio?\n\n00:03:22,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yep, absolutely. Look, I think that we are really looking to actions as an indicator for what could happen in the future. You know, I thought it was really, you know, really interesting. Just, you know, it's only a short time since, you know, Prasad has been back. We know that he's very actively involved in approvals. You know, Presagen's drug, you know, got approved, right? This is, you know, a drug for a small patient population. A kind of disease caused by persistent HPV. And this got approved on a pretty small trial. It got full approval. And I thought it was really interesting in the FDA press release. There is this quote from Dr. Vinay Prasad saying, 'randomized trials, not always needed to approve medical products.' And this approval is proof of that philosophy. The FDA will always demand the correct clinical study for the specific medical product and disease.","char_start":0,"char_end":4311,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

The FDA will always demand the correct clinical study for the specific medical product and disease.\n\n00:04:23,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n Our requirements for products given to tens of millions of healthy people will be different than products given to at most hundreds or thousands of patients with unique diseases. So I think we can all kind of look at past statements and you know, and behaviors, and maybe wonder, like, what the heck is going to happen? You know, I think that, you know, it's, you know, really important to see, obviously, that statement that Dr. Prasad was making was not unique to, you know, the Prisogen, you know, case example. So I hope that we get. uh, you know, more examples and more um, you know, more details on uh, you know, just how you know, approval pathways may be evolving and changing. But I thought that was very interesting, especially when contrasted to you know, to some of the other, you know, regulatory decisions that have maybe, you know, occurred earlier this year where there was a little, you know, less clarity on why things didn't get approved.\n\n00:05:31,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, pedophilates have always been marginal at best in terms of risk rewards, right? You rarely get paid to the upside to a meaningful degree for approval that, maybe, that's changed a little bit lately. Actually, interestingly, but in the event of a non-approval, you know, the result can be relatively catastrophic. So, with this, with the new administration, one might think that the risk-reward of pedophiles has even further deteriorated. Tests from an investor lens, how do you kind of think about those binary events and navigating them?\n\n00:06:09,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, it really, you know, it really it really depends. I mean, obviously, Presagen is up dramatically because people were not anticipating that that approval would would really happen. And it did. So you know, I think it's harder to gauge, but in a way that like— It's harder to gauge means that you know, the risk-reward is now in an approval. If you think that you have a different view than the markets, you know, what does the market know now about like— you know, I think for these, you know, maybe grayer cases where it's a little less clear if, like, approval is baked in or not.\n\n00:06:45,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I think there. In some ways, is a little bit more of a discontinuity on approval, right? I'd point to urogen as another case, right, where there was a 'you know,' a pretty, I would say, dramatic advisory committee. you know, a bit of a mixed vote.\n\n00:07:04,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, the company, you know, kind of navigated FDA interactions after that and, you know, got approved and I think the stock didn't move. you know, a whole lot of approval, but certainly moved, well, you know, actually it did, you know, move quite a bit just before approval after they hired some reps. And then I think, you know, kind of on approval and then, you know, quite a bit afterwards. So it's interesting in some ways. You know, the uncertainty that's being injected into any company that has an open label trial or, you know, a smaller sample size or. You know, didn't have the perfect control arm. Amen. You know, if you think you have a differentiated view, maybe there's actually a bit more of a move on the approval for those medicines. Different case for something where approval is really baked in and expected, and where it would be a shock if it weren't. Um and that's, you know, I think that's the the case for for insmad and bremsacatinib, and you know, I think that's. That's why we didn't see this huge kind of reaction to the day.\n\n00:08:11,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I guess it kind of dovetails into a related topic around binary events. Certainly, pedophilates can be very binary events.

Certainly, pedophilates can be very binary events. Eric, maybe for you in biotech, is it easier to make money playing binary events or avoiding binary events?\n\n00:08:28,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, no doubt the latter. 100%, right? In fact, you know, we've always discussed how the best way to play any event is well, well, well before anyone else is playing it. Right when you you could buy a stock three, six, twelve months in advance of an event and get the run into the event without taking the binary risk. I think why is it tough to make money on binary events?\n\n00:08:54,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n You actually called me out earlier today on this. He said I had rose-colored glasses. And you're right, I do. And I think almost all of us who have been around this industry. need to have rose-colored glasses, in part because you know there's so much hope for patients in our business, in part because we're rooting for the companies that are trying to serve these patients well. In part because it's a really, really difficult business to make money in. So when you approach a binary event, have a bit of a rose tint to your glasses. Most likely, as Tess was just describing, the risk-reward on that event itself is not going to be favorable. If all of us have rose-colored glasses and And I think the likelihood of success is You know, 70%, when it's really 50-50, that's it. Terrible risk reward. And I think we've proven ourselves that way time and time again over at least the years, decades that I've been watching the industry. Um, but you know, the time to buy often is 12 months before anyone's ever even thought about that event before stocks really adjusted at all to whatever potential risk benefit we might have.\n\n00:10:06,979 [SPEAKER_1]\n Fortunately, we've got a lot of stocks and a lot of opportunity to do just that. So that's always been a philosophy of mine. Um, You know, Tess, Josh, what are your thoughts?\n\n00:10:16,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'd love to hear your take.\n\n00:10:18,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think it all comes down to like differentiated perspective.\n\n00:10:23,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, differentiated perspective and like level of conviction, and what are you doing on the back of that event if it goes how you want or if it doesn't go how you want? Um, and I think that can inform a lot, you know, particularly. For a fund, you know, for bigger funds, right? It's hard to just. You know. Efficiently kind of play around these events right, because you know that in and of itself would actually move the stock right. So you really have to— you know, enter positions with you know, conviction and the understanding that, like, hey, like you might have to sit through some binaries. Because if you're trying to play around that binary, you might cause things to go the other way just by being a pretty substantial. Um, you know, percentage of uh, you know, percentage of that company's volume. So. I think that's a key part, really, you know, for any, you know, certainly for any bigger fund, like, what positions to go into is like, how do those. you know, catalyst set up.\n\n00:11:24,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, it's always wonderful. to um, you know, invest in companies where like, maybe you have a few different potential outcomes, but you're like, hey, actually, in several of those outcomes.\n\n00:11:36,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know there's there's uh you know still an opportunity to buy. Right, maybe it's disappointing to others, but you know exciting for us. Uh, you know exciting for us uh you know for some way or the other.\n\n00:11:48,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n It often feels like moths to a flame for biotech investors, gravitating towards the binary events, and often literally because, you know, so oftentimes you get burned by those binary events. It can be very difficult to. to um to drive performance with that strategy. But then on the other hand, I think, Tess, kind of what you're in some ways alluding to is the large size of funds relative to the small size of company valuations and market cap and just trading dynamics and liquidity.","char_start":7824,"char_end":12055,"start_time":"00:08:11","end_time":null}

Another interesting dynamic that we're dealing with this year and with this administration compared to the prior administration. For whom I— If you'd asked me a year ago who the head of HHS was in 2024, I probably wouldn't even be able to tell you, but I think we all know. Who the head of HHS is today. And we've had some Now, pullback in funding of mRNA vaccines. I think RFK justified that as his concerns that a monovalent vaccine that you would get from an mRNA vaccine, certainly for inhaled respiratory viruses, may actually be fodder for mutations and escape from those vaccines, and his view is that it perpetuated the pandemic. I'm not sure what, if any, evidence there is to actually support that dynamic specifically around mRNA vaccines.\n\n00:13:21,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think the head of NIH, Eric J. Bhattacharya, had some views on this as well to discuss.\n\n00:13:32,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, yeah, I mean, I guess we've gotten now in a week or so since RFK Jr. and BARDA withdrew funding for mRNA research, we've got a couple of different rationales from the administration as to why they did that. RFK Jr., as you said, Josh, blamed it on. The lack of safety and efficacy around the vaccine technology based on mRNA. And then Dr. Bhattacharya came out later and said, 'No, no, no,' it's not about lack of efficacy or safety. It's about public distrust of the technology. Well, God, that's. That's interesting. I mean, why would we be distrustful of the technology? Maybe it's our government that's been telling us to distrust the technology. I don't know. Um, so that's a whole different can of worms there but The sad part of all of this is that mRNA is a molecule, right? This is chemistry. This is a bunch of nucleotides strung together. It doesn't have a political will. It's just science.\n\n00:14:32,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n and how this technology got wrapped up into, you know, the debate over COVID and and who was right and who was wrong. It's just really quite sad and sickening.\n\n00:14:45,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I hope that we can distanced ourselves from the politics here. and put mRNA back into its place, which is a tool. Maybe it's an imperfect tool in some cases. Maybe, as we've seen through the COVID pandemic, it can be a very helpful tool in others. and stop treating it as a political football, but rather a technology that should be.\n\n00:15:09,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n assessed. should be funded, should be developed, should be critiqued. should be. Studied in clinical trials and, unfortunately, we're just not there right now.\n\n00:15:21,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n Tess, any thoughts on it?\n\n00:15:24,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I guess I'd just point to, you know, it's always a little bit discouraging to see a decision like that that kind of stems more from what does the public thinks, right? And how do people feel about something versus, you know, a real evidence base. So, look, as you said, Eric, there's so many ways in which mRNA is a tool and is used for many different diseases, many different. you know, many different, you know, formats. You know, I'm hopeful that just as more applications are.\n\n00:16:09,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n um you you know, continue to be demonstrated that this, you know, that this turns around. I'm also hopeful. um that you know we can we can really uh maybe maybe hopeful is is too optimistic but I would I would want I would want for uh you know a world where decisions about funding are really based on societal benefit and a view of what are the scientific endeavors that can really help us as a society rather than public sentiment.","char_start":11755,"char_end":15822,"start_time":"00:12:18","end_time":null}

You know, in a time of true crisis, but that platform is somehow become vilified and seemingly, by a fairly fringe group, but a fringe group that now has national voice. A national attention, right and to the point of it, it's now all politicized in ways that are so unscientific. Right there's nothing wrong with asking provocative questions, there's nothing wrong with wanting data and evidence to support the appropriate use of these vaccines to support you know the safety profile of the vaccines. I'm not sure we still have the best capture mechanism for vaccine safety, I'm not sure one is even feasible. It's so hard.\n\n00:17:42,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n Look, if you get a vaccine and something happens to you the next day, yes, that's probably easy to correlate to the vaccine, although there's also still noise because random things happen to random people all the time. Um, But if it's a week later, if it's a month later, if it's five years later, how on earth do you connect something? You know, to one point in time so long ago and it's just a— it's a challenge for for science and. There are a lot of unknowns that we're dealing with and the unknowns just get filled with. Conspiracy theories, speculation, half-truths, some truths. It just makes it very, very difficult to navigate, especially when there's not a healthy, balanced. Pro-patient, pro-science dialogue to advance the field. And instead, it's kind of left in the hands of mavericks and conspiracy theorists. Rip things apart as opposed to gently bending things to to optimize them—so, just what an odd year to be living in if you're a scientist.\n\n00:18:49,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right, again, kind of late. On specific news this week. So I thought we'd talk about some themes and trends that we're seeing. One interesting trend that I think many have noticed is the successful stock performance around product launches. Not 100% of them, but far more than we've ever seen before.\n\n00:19:14,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n So a lot of focus on product launches, I guess. Eric and Tess, is the product launch trade getting a little long in the tooth here, or is this still an area that you think is going to be able to deliver value for shareholders?\n\n00:19:32,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, maybe I'll start. Maybe first we should talk a little bit about why this trade seemingly has worked and then go on to maybe— if it's getting long in the tooth for certain products. I mean, certain products are now getting a little bit past their launch phase— is the way I would answer your question, Josh.\n\n00:19:50,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n If you've had a drug that's been on the market now for 12 or 18 months, people have woken up to the fact that it's probably having a good launch and have priced that into the stock. So certainly, for certain franchises, I think. The longer the launch view is playing itself out. But in other cases, you know, for new drug launches that have yet to uh, to transpire, I think it's still working and I think the reason it's still working is because one. First and foremost, pricing. We're just seeing more aggressive pricing out of the box than we've ever seen before. It's not something new in 2025. It's been happening. For the course of the last two, three, four, five years, every year that passes, we price our new drugs at a higher price point. Everything is priced to be a blockbuster. It used to be that. You know, a billion-dollar peak revenue estimate was. was quite unusual in Wall Street models. And these days, they're all over the place.","char_start":15522,"char_end":19523,"start_time":"00:16:45","end_time":null}

And these days, they're all over the place.\n\n00:20:50,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n So when you price your drug at a high premium, most likely you're going to sell it. Quite well, especially in the early days with those patients who were in great need. The second trend, in my opinion, is about payor reimbursement pressures. I don't think we're seeing them as much as we used to. And I'd love your and Tess's view on this. But to me, and I don't know if it's because the PBMs have been in bed with the health care insurers or what. It just seems like we are talking a lot less about reimbursement restrictions, about tiering. Thank you. Pharmacy status, co-pays, and things like that— than we really have in the last few three, four, five years. And I think that means that these drugs, out of the box, are doing quite well. But Tessa, I'd be curious.\n\n00:21:41,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, maybe Eric— another um— you know, a different perspective— maybe on the on the payer stuff. You know, I think it's very much still there, but I think that companies have gotten a lot better about communicating it and investors have gotten a lot more sophisticated about, you know, what expectations need to be. You know, I feel like, you know, maybe in the, you know, maybe in the past there wasn't as much.\n\n00:22:08,599 [SPEAKER_0]\n um, you know, focus or understanding on like, Ooh, what's like really going to drive growth to net. And like, how important is it to be like first tier versus second tier? And like, what are the programs that you're going to do? And like, are you going to have a hub and like all of these things that. um you know maybe Well, they are so critical to a launch and to a successful launch.\n\n00:22:30,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n But, you know, I feel like in the, you know, in the past, you know, there were certainly a lot of barriers, but also I think there was just a a kind of lack of communication or lack of appreciation for how some of these factors you know, actually, you know, actually played into things. And I think that's really changed, right? I mean, now you have. You know. companies in you know, when they're talking about their phase three data, like they already have. You know, some perspective about, you know, here's how this might be positioned and what it's probably going to come after and, you know, how we can manage this on formulary. And I think that's, you know, I think that's really important. And, you know, perhaps a part of why, you know, why some of these launches have actually been quite good is like. You know, companies know that they have to navigate this stuff and they have to navigate it, you know, pretty early if they're going to be successful.\n\n00:23:30,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I think it's really positive to just see many smaller biotechs getting way more sophisticated and way more specific about, like. Uh, you know, and we'll talk about the the you know insmed approval. But I think it's actually been pretty consistent across several companies where they've been really specific about, like, here's the total population, but here's the launch population. Here's how we're, you know, expecting things to play out on the payer side. Here's some puts and takes on how that could go. Here's like at least a framework for thinking about gross to net. You know, here's how to think about like the IRA catastrophic payment payer mix. All this stuff—um, that you know— is such a key part of like the complexity of a launch and what you need to to make it go well. I think the level of sophistication has really, really improved.\n\n00:24:22,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I think. The old definition of blockbuster was a billion-dollar product. Eric, to your point, everything's priced to a billion. So I think now the blockbuster definition is probably closer to $5 billion. And part of the way that companies are getting there are with drug prices higher than we've really ever seen them and oftentimes higher than we thought they were going to be.\n\n00:24:48,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I guess it begs the question. What is the probability that in the next election cycle new drug pricing becomes a target for either party?\n\n00:25:05,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Josh, you're specifically referencing new drug prices.","char_start":19223,"char_end":23705,"start_time":"00:20:50","end_time":null}

Now we have the IRA. What was the solution to the IRA? Launch at a higher price so that when you hit that discount.\n\n00:25:29,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, it's not necessarily as impactful as it might have been, but you got to imagine at some point. Drug prices now come into the crosshairs of politicians.\n\n00:25:43,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think drug prices have been in the crosshairs of politicians for a long, long time. And now you're maybe making a subtle tweak to that in terms of focusing on new drug launch pricing. Which you know you you may have a point. Um, maybe you know there's been somewhat of a blind eye toward that aspect of of the business as opposed to the drug price increases that companies have taken or the disparity in pricing between the US and ex-US nations that we've seen. I mean, those two.\n\n00:26:15,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n Concerns have been very much in the public eye and public focus, and we're obviously debating and and uh, you know, the throes of potential um, changes to the system in that regard. So sure, I think it's possible that we may also see, you know, a little bit more attention on new drug prices. But Tess, you're very close to this with your 'no patient left behind' stuff.\n\n00:26:39,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, I think the, you know, kind of calibration point on all of this is like. outrage. And in the past, we have seen real outrage at certain launch prices or certain price increases over time where the patient community is feeling it.\n\n00:27:01,830 [SPEAKER_0]\n Physicians are feeling the access constraints that come as a result of that. And I feel like that is— really. You know, a bit of a check on on where these, you know, prices go. And I do think that. Look for, you know, we haven't seen that for some pretty high-price launches that have happened in the past year or two years.\n\n00:27:32,919 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, you know, I think that politicians and I think the reason for that is, you know, the way that. Yes, the drugs are high priced, but they're actually like. Also, in many ways, like very closely managed by the payers, right?\n\n00:27:51,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, the price is high, but. You know, I think, you know, the utilization, you know, kind of goes along with that. Um, so I think that companies are pretty careful in thinking through that. I can't think of any company that wants to be a kind of focus and source of outrage by patient community, or physician community. So I think it's a really fair point, Josh. My hope would be that, you know, companies continue to take that, you know, kind of threat of outrage into consideration. You know, when they're thinking about, you know, pricing their therapies and negotiating access for their therapies, um, so that they're uh, you know, really really staying within bounds of like what society thinks is acceptable and what. You know, what insurers are going to put on formulary and, you know, deliver access for.\n\n00:28:49,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and it also dovetails into the most favored nation, the effort to get other countries to pay more and, perhaps, as a quid, try to get U. S. payers to pay less, which may require legislation of some form.\n\n00:29:03,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n We'll have to see how it goes and appreciative that we have. The 'no patient left behind' narrative to kind of help counter some of the pressure that we may start to face again on drug pricing.

So, great effort and great group that you have there.\n\n00:29:18,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yes, and maybe just a perspective on the MFN stuff, because I actually think that the MFN stuff in terms of, hey, will raising prices in Europe and other geographies, will that actually lower prices in the US? And I think it does in the long term. And the way that I think it does in the long term is it actually increases competition, right? It makes it that much easier for the fourth to market, fifth to market company to say, 'Here's geographies or spaces where I can actually play and win because the market is simply big enough.\n\n00:29:57,399 [SPEAKER_0]\n Because other geographies, you know, other people are paying. It's not just, you know, it's not just the US. And I think that competition, I mean, we saw it. Um, you know, in space, in the hepatitis C market, right? Where we went from, like, gosh, like $84,000 a year to, like, now it's like, what, like $15,000 a year for like a hepatitis C cure? And that was because of, you know, second to market, third to market coming in and having to be really competitive on price because, you know, the product profile simply wasn't as, you know, simply wasn't as attractive. So I think that's kind of the longer term view, you know, that, you know. I have that No Patient Left Behind has. On how MFN really does actually bring benefits to the US market just through more competition and simply more drugs competing. And some of those are going to be on price.\n\n00:30:51,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Alright, well maybe now moving on to another topic again somewhat relatedly that has to do with.\n\n00:31:00,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n All these new forces we're dealing with that we never really had to pay attention to, MFN tariffs.\n\n00:31:08,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um. IRA Dynamics, HHS, FD Josh, I can't hear you.\n\n00:31:27,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n Tess, did he go out on your end too? He went out. There he is.\n\n00:31:33,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n There he is. You're back, Josh.\n\n00:31:35,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n We missed about a half minute or so from MFN and other broad dynamics to something else.\n\n00:31:42,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's weird. Hopefully you can still hear me if I drop off. Just keep going without me.\n\n00:31:48,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n But I'm here. So I guess what I'm noticing is because there are so many new, uh, focal points for investors to follow— you know, MFN, tariffs, IRA, HHS, and all the volatility of the sector. Um, investment horizons, which have always been short, have actually continued to compress even further.\n\n00:32:13,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n I get almost no interest in 2026 catalysts yet. It feels like we're kind of at the point of the year where the interest in what's ahead in 2026 should start to pick up, but I'm certainly not really hearing much of that. Eric, are you hearing it? And Tess, are you starting to think about 2026? Events are we still all kind of so in the weeds of 25.\n\n00:32:38,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that's a good point. I hadn't thought of it before you just raised it. No, my call volume is similar to yours. It's very much focused on the next three or four months.\n\n00:32:49,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n And you're right— this would be the time of year typically when you'd start to, you know, get those calls and emails saying, 'Tell me at least about your first half of 2026 catalysts One potential consideration, and maybe this is my rose-colored glasses on, is that folks seem to be looking to invest in nearer term milestones, including binary events right now.

I mean, we are, you know, obviously doing both and have the capacity to do both, which is great in terms of thinking about the rest of the year and thinking about 26. Um, but Yeah, I think, you know, what we talked about before is very true, right? When is the right time to like really think about? You know, catalysts and, you know, companies that may be undervalued well before the event where, you know, that may reveal itself. So, you know, I think it's always good practice to be focused on that. I just, you know, I think you're, Josh, I think it's a really good point. I mean, we've just gone through such an incredible macro upheaval. Where literally it's like, can you even focus on next week? Because you're just trying to figure out what's happening today. So I think, you know, interested in both of you. Thoughts. But I think it's also just a bit of catch up where people are like, oh, my gosh, OK, like maybe, you know, tomorrow I'm not going to get whacked with MFN.\n\n00:35:13,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n Gee, let me think about some like, you know, cool like data that might be coming up like that. Sounds like fun.\n\n00:35:19,750 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right. No, it's like there are so many blind spots now because we have, in the way of our field of view, all these other forces that are pulling us away. Um. I think there's some incredible risk awards just out there with important events coming. 2026 or beyond, where where you know that valuation of the company might reflect, you know, a five to 10% chance of working. And in reality, it's north of 50%. And those arbitrage situations often are not sustained; they tend to close as you get closer to the data set and as investors start to turn their attention there. So you know, another way of like being able to drive performance without taking the binary exposure of each event. Now, on the topic of a lot of distractions that we're dealing with. Um. Is that the topic of earnings calls and particularly earnings calls for non-commercial companies?\n\n00:36:20,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n And you know, they can often be fairly lengthy in terms of the prepared remarks. The prepared remarks are generally backward-looking, not materially forward-looking, and recaps of where the company is often— you know, a fair amount of redundancy. Q&A section time that often you just hear analysts asking questions for the sake of being heard on a call, not really advancing the dialogue or contributing to the understanding of a company.\n\n00:36:52,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Test, we'll start with you on this one. Your views of earnings calls, particularly for pre-commercial or less evolving, less dynamic, kind of more static, early-stage innovating companies.\n\n00:37:07,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n Do you like when they do the earnings calls?

Any thoughts in terms of how they could be done better, if at all?\n\n00:37:15,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it's such a good point. I mean, I feel like, you know, in some ways it is just more of a distraction than a benefit when you are, you know, when you are, you know, early-stage and it's really going to be data that drives things. And why not just do calls around data? Um, and what's distracting about it is, like, sometimes it really does matter for even, like, development stage or early stage companies because, you know, they may choose to, you know, include, you know, some pretty critical data like in the earnings release sometimes. And so you kind of like have to pay attention because it might really matter. But like, oh, like. Also, it's, you know, distracting because I'd say, you know, very frequently it doesn't really matter. So, you know, I think that to the extent that there's just, you know, a lot of key information about, you know, what are investors typically looking for in a quarter for a development stage company? It's like. You know, how much cash do you have? When are you running out of money?\n\n00:38:16,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Are all of your programs still on track? Are you doing anything new? Right. And I think that usually that can really be encompassed in the body of a press release. And anyone who, you know, wants more color can always take the time to talk to management. And, you know, anyone who is, but, you know, it kind of just allows more focus on like, what are the things that really do matter, which. uh you know, for development stage companies and you know discovery stage companies really tends to be data releases. And then I do think like, as you get to like, hey phase three and like you're getting into, you know, kind of regulatory and like planning for launch. Like I do think that it's, you know, generally, you know, pretty helpful to actually have, like, start having those calls. Ideally before launch, just because there are so many moving parts sometimes with what you have to do to get ready. And it's really helpful to hear that type of detail.\n\n00:39:19,839 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'd be interested, Josh and Eric, in how you think about this and where you'd like to see development stage earnings calls go, if If at all.\n\n00:39:30,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n Eric, give us your take.\n\n00:39:33,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, Josh, not surprisingly, I'll take the other side of the coin from you. and I guess tests as well. I actually. I kinda think we should be doing these as a kind of regular best practices going forward policy. And the reason I do is because, you know, from a company standpoint, it's a very competitive world out there, right? I mean, there are 500 companies. They're all looking for capital.\n\n00:39:58,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Neither voice is heard. If you don't do an earnings call. If you don't communicate even minor updates that you've made over the last three months. People will forget about you. They'll assume. You haven't done anything?\n\n00:40:15,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n You won't get the benefit of analysts asking you questions. You won't get the benefit of the loudspeaker in terms of sell-side notes coming out after the fact to you. You're in danger of kind of becoming a non-entity. And that's a really, really, really dangerous place to be. Josh, even within our universe of coverage, I bet. I bet when you think about companies that do regular earnings calls, you just come off the Q2 earnings season, of course. You're probably more fresh and up to date on those companies that did a call versus those that didn't. I'm guessing. I don't know. But that would be the rationale for why these companies seemingly are. Or. potentially using a little bit too much of our time. On a daily basis with these calls. Look, I don't think anyone loves to listen to analysts spout off, as you just said.\n\n00:41:06,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I do understand the purpose and I do think it. Allows me as a busy person who's trying to keep track of 20 or 30 names very closely and another 30 or so names somewhat closely.

Keeps me a little bit more up to date on those stories.\n\n00:41:23,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's yeah, I mean I think both sides are have very legitimate points. Um, I think it can be a little challenging or frustrating.\n\n00:41:34,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n In part because it's a little bit of information overload. Uh, you know there are certainly days where there's 100 companies reporting earnings.\n\n00:41:44,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n and we've all had this scenario where, like, multiple of our companies all have their earnings calls going on at the exact same time and so you kind of trying to to rush through it and and get all the key takeaways in a short period of time. It's not a great time for for you know new for for a chance to digest you know really new information certainly about pipeline products.\n\n00:42:08,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's a fair amount of wasted air time in terms of reviewing financials that don't matter. That's always the point. For me, that's the point of frustration because it's a point of tone deafness.\n\n00:42:20,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n If if you think trivial numbers around R&D spending that we could have seen in a press release of material to investors. Is this a little knock on your credibility and understanding of what what really does matter? I get that there's this cookie cutter approach and folks may be nervous to break the mold. I get that folks may be nervous to say, 'Oh well, if we're doing an earnings call for for one earnings now, does that mean we need to do them for every other earnings?' I just i don't understand why that needs to be like that. Why isn't there flexibility in the way that we narrate these companies? Why do companies have to do a call? On an earnings day release as opposed to just having a mid-quarter. Update around anything that's changed, that's material to give. Analysts and investors a chance to ask the question. And not be one of like 100 companies all coming out at the same time that that can make things overwhelming to some extent. It's our problem. It's not the company's problem. They're not doing anything wrong.\n\n00:43:21,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n Right, it's nothing wrong with hosting in the mix. Call nothing wrong with reviewing you know, all the minutia of financials that don't really matter. It is our problem. But it's a problem nonetheless that. You know, in theory, could be optimized by a little bit more attentiveness to companies, a little bit more realization of the bandwidth that they are consuming. With long introductory comments, maybe they have a reason for making them. I generally think they tend not to be as effective as companies think they are. Like these standard earnings calls. Don't move stocks. Like no one listens to your earning call. Know for a development stage company for the most part, unless there's something big and mature material and says, 'Well, they really changed my mind with those introductory comments.' There are all sorts of kind of odd and unusual embedded practices that I think are just. Very very hard for one reason to to shift away from. So an ongoing conversation point, especially around those weeks of earnings where we'll literally have hundreds of companies reporting that week.\n\n00:44:32,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, all right. Maybe next topic, IPO window remains closed, but a successful SPAC, or SPAC-SPAC, what's going on? Eric.\n\n00:44:45,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh yeah, actually, it was, I think, Endpoints have pointed out, it's been six months since the last IPO in biotech or last real IPO in biotech. That was Aardvark. Josh, I know you were part of that one. And that's a pretty long dry spell. I think the longest dry spell is something like 20 months or so in the history of industry. So we're nothing like that just yet.\n\n00:45:06,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n But six months relative to historical norms is still a very lengthy period. We did have a SPAC, and the SPAC was the name actually we were involved with, Bridge Bio Oncology Therapeutics, or BBOT. Uh, company was incubated as part of Bridge Bio and spun out about a year ago as a private company and and chose to go public via the SPAC process. It raised a lot of money.

It's got a great list of shareholders.\n\n00:45:38,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, you know, not that we're giving investment advice on this program but but it is a name that that we think quite highly of. And they chose the SPAC route, which I guess is somewhat interesting to me. I don't know if this company had gone public. Via the traditional IPO dog and pony roadshow. Whether they would have had as much success, I mean, obviously, with a SPAC, you have a pretty narrow set of shareholders and backers. Tess, I don't remember if RA was involved in this or not, so chime in here. And with an IPO, you obviously are opening yourself up to a broader set of buyers, though lately, at least, IPOs have been pretty narrow in their support as well, maybe not quite as narrow as a SPAC. Um, I do think that you know, having not gone through the IPO roadshow process, the visibility and knowledge that surrounds this company is a little bit lower. They have a lower profile than they might have otherwise had. But they got what they needed, which is a terrific valuation.\n\n00:46:43,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n Great group of shareholders. Capital to take their oncology therapeutics forward. We may see more of these in this very choppy environment, but be curious as to what you guys are thinking.\n\n00:46:56,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, Tess, how are you thinking about the IPO window? What are the signals that you'd want to see? As an investor, to encourage, you know, companies that, you know, in the area capital portfolio to test the IPO waters, like is, and is it.\n\n00:47:13,879 [SPEAKER_2]\n Is there a reasonable signal that you're looking for? Like, how are we even going to know?\n\n00:47:21,150 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think it always comes down to like market demand, right?\n\n00:47:24,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n Are investors excited to put money into the company? And, you know, if they [if] enough want to do that, then, hey, maybe it's a time that company should be public, obviously kind of. You know, stage, you know, stage dependent and, you know, management team, you know, dependent on all that. But I think it really does come down to just. investor— you know, investor demand and you know, really starting with your insiders, right? And do you have, you know, a few insiders around the table who are really, you know, eager to invest more and, you know, facilitate, you know, facilitate a public listing? Um, you know, I think it is interesting, like just what, and yes, we were, you know, we did sponsor us back. You know, we've also had several of our companies go through reverse mergers or pair up with reverse merge companies. And what I think works really well, with that structure, is like you agree on price, right?\n\n00:48:31,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n And you're kind of coming to the table with, here is what the price is going to be. Here is what the deal is going to look like. It's much more like a private company deal process, right? Which is what, you know, what's a little bit easier to do in this market, right? Is a private company deal process where, like, you have a party that kind of names their price and they see if they can get everyone together. And if they don't, then, like, hey, maybe the terms were quite right. Maybe you have to modify things. Maybe you have to. You know, price a little bit different and, like, hey, maybe then you can go and get things done. You know, the IPO process is like it is, you know, it is a different and, you know, it's a very different process for kind of finding. price, right? Everyone's kind of sitting around the table, like watching each other with 'are you going to put money in?' 'Are you going to put it in at a higher price?' 'Are you, you know, is that like your real order?' 'Or like, are you just putting in those numbers?' 'Cause you want to wait to like, see if everyone else likes this IPO, but you actually only want like $5 million.","char_start":42441,"char_end":46574,"start_time":"00:45:38","end_time":null}

And, you know, trade out like, you know, it's such a kind of like. Uh, you know, challenging, uh, you know, process to like find truth in, um, and uh, you know, Josh and Eric. I know that we've, you know, talked about just our approach to thinking through that, which is really starting with your insiders and, kind of, you know, in a way compensating them for giving you real information about pricing by like, giving them the allocation that they want at a price where you're 70% covered by your insiders. But all that to say, in a period of great volatility, having that kind of lead investor and like pricing certainty, I think really helps, you know, deals get done and makes it more like a private transaction.\n\n00:50:19,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. I think one of the challenges I see for the IPO window in particular is that the highest caliber companies—who, you know, in an ideal world would be the first to kind of test the IPO window— because they're going to have the best prospects for success are the ones who least need to do it because they can still access plenty of capital from from private investors as needed. They often have a fair amount of capital already. So it's not as much urgency for them. So we actually rarely start trying to open the IPO window with our best, which in theory would be the best way to do it because those are the companies that are likely to have strong out-of-the-gate performance and really start to crank that window open wider for the rest. But instead, we kind of probably wind up with that middle tier, right? It's the companies that, you know, good enough to consider an IPO, maybe not the best of the best, but. They're the ones that are actually perhaps now pressured to find alternative sources of capital beyond their private investors and so.\n\n00:51:25,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, the IPO window to open in that way has to be more of a poll. Right, like it has to be even healthier because we're not necessarily leading with it with our best, and so those companies that do go through have to be very um reasonable on valuation. There needs to be enough investor appetite for those type of companies as opposed to the elite of the elite, which is, I think, where investors are starting to focus. So I'm hopeful that at some point. The IPO window will crack open just enough for the really high-caliber companies to come through. It's not a short list of high-caliber companies. It's a long list of high-caliber companies, which is what I am super excited for, unbelievably intimidated by, because I mean, we're. If the window really does open and these high-quality companies start leaping through it, we're going to be incredibly busy.\n\n00:52:23,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n And incredibly busy in a really good and a really exciting way, but incredibly busy nonetheless. So we'll see how that all evolves. We've got a few more topics to cover towards the end here. I guess Summit Therapeutics, Eric, what was going on there? They elected not to host an earnings call. It's funny that we were just talking about earnings calls and now a company that didn't host an earnings call caused a problem. What is going on?\n\n00:52:48,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I guess this comes back to the debate we just had about whether development stage companies will or should host earnings calls. Summit is one heck of a developer— stage company. This is a $20 billion market cap development stage company. So they're a little bit of an outlier to begin with. And to the point you made earlier, Josh, yeah, they did host an earnings call last quarter. They chose not to. This time around, that change in strategy was viewed, I think, a little bit skeptically by some.","char_start":46274,"char_end":50302,"start_time":"00:49:31","end_time":null}

And to the point you made earlier, Josh, yeah, they did host an earnings call last quarter. They chose not to. This time around, that change in strategy was viewed, I think, a little bit skeptically by some.\n\n00:53:22,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n And the vacuum of information that it created, in particular, not holding a conference call, led to a lot of debate and discussion, at least behind the scenes. There were a couple of disclosures. Clinical data disclosures, but more financial disclosures in their release that were also a little bit unorthodox. So it was a little bit of a storm in a teacup this week. It was my number one incoming call volume stock in the last five days. And I think, had they hosted a conference call, it would definitely not have been the case, right? It would have been an open forum and everyone would have had an opportunity to hear management's answers to the same questions that we all wanted to ask. Um, but that's not the way it played out. So and in fact, the stock was was a little bit weak too. It's been an underperformer and a good tape otherwise for biotech. So, maybe um, you know, another reason to to think again about not holding a nice call, especially if you're is closely watching this summit. I mean, there aren't too many again 20 billion dollar development stage companies.\n\n00:54:25,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n This one is, you know, been very volatile as a story for multiple reasons.\n\n00:54:33,849 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I guess you just can't win when it comes to earnings calls. You do them, you don't do them. There's always going to be someone who's frustrated—um, but thank you for that. That context—um, I think a lot of the revenue-generating earning companies have already reported, certainly from my coverage universe, it was a very mixed bag. Although I think overall, it was a very good second quarter across the board. One company that did report this week was ARS Pharma with their launch of Nefi, which is a nasal epinephrine to replace EpiPens.\n\n00:55:06,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n And, you know, they're gaining traction. It's been one of those high volume, low price launches, which are always hard to execute on because you just need to wait for. High volumes of prescription writers—often a mile wide, inch deep type of market— contrast with the ultra-rare conditions, where you know you put 50 patients on drug and you already have 25 million of revenue. This is a very different model to their credit. They are executing on the launch, they are starting to get traction. It's back to school season. And so that's been helping them test. I know this is a name of interest to you. I got a lot of questions. In terms of why the stock sold off after what looked like a good second quarter earnings. My take on it was that Now is actually really the time where they need to deliver. On this launch, because as you look at the third quarter revenue estimates, you know they really need to step it up. And so I think investors are starting to look towards that second quarter.\n\n00:56:07,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think they seem to be on track to hit that number as well, still a little bit early in the quarter. And then there are also some competitive dynamics that are at play. Test—I'm not sure if you wanted to talk about this name in particular. I know your capital is very close to ARS.\n\n00:56:23,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think I think— just maybe on the, you know, I think this is an area where convenience really does matter, right? And, you know, there's a lot of people who are, you know, scared of needles, especially children. And it's great to see. I mean, we have ARS on the market. And the other thing that we saw this week was Equestiv. And they actually have a patch. You know, therapy that you can put, you know, that dissolves into your tongue. And, you know, this is a company that, you know, I think they're in discussions with the FDA now about the. Uh, you know, approval path they were talking about. Um, you know, on their on their uh Q2 update about the timing for a potential adcom and if that may or may not happen. And, you know, they announced just earlier this week a funding agreement with RTW and, you know, pretty substantial offering of common stock.","char_start":50002,"char_end":54340,"start_time":"00:53:22","end_time":null}

You know, a fair bit of these deals kind of happen in the pre-launch space. Maybe something to just, you know, call out that was pretty interesting about this deal is, you know, really. Having the strategic funding agreement that they provided being contingent on approval, right? So I think. Um, you know that can certainly be reassuring for investors, knowing that if it gets approved, there is money to really support the launch.\n\n00:58:03,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, excellent. All right, a couple of final topics. Tessa, if you want to cover either of these, the INSMED approval and Sarepta safety data.\n\n00:58:11,580 [SPEAKER_0]\n Absolutely. So, INSMED approval, you know, probably one of the most, you know, highly anticipated, you know, launches across the sector.\n\n00:58:20,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n Brenzopatinib. Called Brinsipri for bronchiectasis. And, you know, big congratulations to the team here.\n\n00:58:31,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n Has been just an excellent case study in communicating the market opportunity and communicating unmet need.\n\n00:58:41,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n The success was very broadly anticipated to our previous discussion about 'do you get paid for sitting through approvals,' but really, clean label, didn't talk about prior exacerbations, flexibility for 10 meg or 25 meg.\n\n00:59:01,209 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, you know, I think, you know, I think there's a lot of excitement around this this launch. And, you know, we should know, you know, we should know next next quarter. So that will be obviously highly anticipated.\n\n00:59:12,839 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then I think another one that we wanted to hit on. was Sarepta. giving an update. on giving an update to the patient community. really, really focused on just sharing more details on some of the deaths and sharing more details on what's happened in ambulatory, non-ambulatory. I think, really good and important to have this disclosure. I think. You know, always, I think, with safety, just critical to get this information out, ideally as early as possible. And just essential to have this, well, well characterized. So, you know, they're, you know, good to see them, you know, coming out with this, you know, coming out with this now.\n\n01:00:09,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n All right.

We got a lot to talk about today, but Sam, you wanted to kind of kick it off maybe with a more positive outlook on just the biotech space. Trading well. Maybe you can just give a few thoughts on some of the fundamental factors and then. I have a quick view and I'd love to hear others as well, but Sam please take it away.\n\n00:00:49,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, sure. Paul. Um, hello everybody. We've been a bit of a August hiatus, so it's nice that we're all back. Back to school.\n\n00:00:58,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, look, I'm looking at the S &P.\n\n00:01:02,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n By XBI, right now, 11. 9% up in the past month.\n\n00:01:08,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n And that's versus 2% up against the S &P 500. So that is not a normal scenario for us to be living in. We've had years of, well, I don't know how many years now, two or three years. Where we've underperformed the S &P. And now, S&P, of course, is in a very interesting situation where it's driven mostly by a few companies. But even there, some of them seem to be running out of steam.\n\n00:01:38,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n Competition between a Broadcom story versus an NVIDIA story versus an advanced micro story, etc. So that's looking great. Um, we also had um this fact that a lot of passed through for two or three years, we know we've been driven by macro in terms of higher interest rates, making it tougher for people to bring in cash into.\n\n00:02:04,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, higher beta stocks and sectors such as biotech, especially, and then, of course, at the same time, we were dealing with a lot of two early-stage IPOs happened in 19, 20, 21. So there was a confluence of factors. Maybe, you know, I think we've been around this a few times, Paul and John and Greg, that we've ended up talking about this only to be thrown back at our face, but it looks positive. I mean, I'm looking at non-farm payrolls just came in at 22,000, much lower than the consensus of 75. Range was 30 to 100.\n\n00:02:40,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's kind of cemented the rate cut for September at 0. 25%. And some people are talking about 0. 5%.\n\n00:02:47,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n percentage point. So that's pretty significant. It's good for biotech, right?\n\n00:02:53,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then you're gone, Paul.\n\n00:02:55,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, no, I mean, they're all great points. And I think it's interesting to see the kind of decoupling from the S &P 500, because I think one factor— and I'm already over my skis with bringing this up— but it's what I hear from some investors that work at these mutual funds that don't just focus on health care is. We're seeing the tech craze and the AI craze come back to earth a little bit, right? And I think that that makes our sector relatively more attractive. So I think that that's one. Thing and then you know we've talked about this another podcast too but you know unlike other years where we have a big bounce back that's driven by M&A there's been a little bit of M&A but, you know, maybe M&A has actually, I think, been maybe more underwhelming with the premiums. I think we're seeing a lot of the smaller midsize companies, you know, have a bunch of successful drug launches.\n\n00:03:41,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I think that's been unique as well. Greg, what are you hearing from investors? And then maybe John would love your perspective too.","char_start":0,"char_end":3890,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Greg, what are you hearing from investors? And then maybe John would love your perspective too.\n\n00:03:49,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, um, I uh, we have a great healthcare sector sales analyst, his name is Jared Holtz, and he provides market commentary. I think it's very consistent with what we're hearing as well, which is you know we've got a couple of big healthcare conferences taking place in New York this week. And generally speaking, sentiment is pretty decent right now in terms of how investors are thinking about the biotech space. It appears that you know the negatives that we've been dealing with and that's uncertainty—something like FDA, HHS, CDC, all of that—has been happening. Certainly, we're still in the interest rate environment that we're in, but at least the negatives are being appreciated. I'm not saying that we're totally out of the clear just yet, but it does seem that on balance, there does seem to be a view that, okay, maybe we understand what the issues are and I think it's really.\n\n00:04:52,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n The positive thing, if you think about where we are in the biotech markets, that if you look at where we've been since May, if you look at over the past decade. And if you take out, obviously, the COVID euphoria that we had, but since May, we've had the largest upward trend in over a decade in biotech right now. So, again.\n\n00:05:15,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Who knows what next week will bring. But I do think that sentiment does appear to be turning at least at this stage. At least that's the sentiment we're hearing coming out of the conferences in New York right now.\n\n00:05:27,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that's great. John, do you have anything to add?\n\n00:05:29,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, nothing different, but I'll triple down on the sentiment of what you guys have said.\n\n00:05:39,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n I do hear from a lot of investors and a lot of companies that people are feeling that there are some green shoots here. And I think it's very correlated with the anticipations around the Fed working on interest rates now, which. which I think is really the driver of some of this recovery beyond some of the fundamental points that you brought up, Paul, which I think also helps enormously.\n\n00:06:09,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n If the Fed does cut rates meaningfully, I think people are shrugging off all the uncertainty on the FDA tariff, SEMFN side of it. That I think people are shrugging off, believing that companies will figure their way through it, which I tend to agree with as well.\n\n00:06:28,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n But yeah, I think we could finally be getting to a better place here. It's been a long time, so I don't want to jinx it. But it feels better than it's been for a while.\n\n00:06:39,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Yeah. And there's been a lot of financings too. I mean, you know. No IPOs, but secondaries that seem to have done well.\n\n00:06:48,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, maybe let's go through some of the news from the past week, or I guess a couple weeks. I think we've got five or six news things to talk about, and then we're going to talk about some catalyst previews and other macro things. Sam, do you want to talk a little bit about Ox40 and the setup for Sanofi, and just implications going forward?\n\n00:07:05,600 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, sure. So this is one of those situations where you don't usually see large pharma trading down 10%. We have seen it with Lilianovo in their back and forth on OPC drugs. But here it was Sanofi's turn yesterday. So the stock was down 10% pretty much at one point, maybe a bit higher, maybe a bit lower. And they had a drug that read out positive, which I'll get to the points in a minute. But the stock was down massive. Why?","char_start":3592,"char_end":7485,"start_time":"00:03:41","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_c2f93887fd12_chunk_0002","doc_id":"doc_c2f93887fd12","order":2,"text":"lianovo in their back and forth on OPC drugs. But here it was Sanofi's turn yesterday. So the stock was down 10% pretty much at one point, maybe a bit higher, maybe a bit lower. And they had a drug that read out positive, which I'll get to the points in a minute. But the stock was down massive. Why?\n\n00:07:33,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Dupixent, which is the drug that they share with Regeneron, or they have a partnership with Regeneron, is expected to have $25. 5 billion in sales in 2030. It easily beats Humira. And that's 38% of revenues in 2030. In 2031, based on current knowledge, the product loses patent protection. So Sanofi needs something to fill it back in. A variety of things. I mean, $25 billion is a tough thing to fill out. So the stock was down 10% on the initial phase three data from the COAST-1 trial of amlitalumab. Which is an ox40 ligand monoclonal antibody for dermatitis. The trial met its primary endpoint, right? But the efficacy is the problem in that it fell short of what would make it interesting as regards comparison to PIXENT. We have to see the detailed data. But the baseline characteristics of the bank brand treatment, et cetera. Uh, but cross trial comparisons honestly show it to be pretty similar to, um.\n\n00:08:40,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n So we do need to see, as I said, more detailed data.\n\n00:08:46,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n It looks like it's trailing the gold standard, which is currently Duprixent.\n\n00:08:52,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n And there are only one in three patients. Antepixent, which are at least, are optimally controlled, so there is room for cycling, just as often there is in these types of diseases, which as we always knew with the TNFs, but there is a glimpse out there on the market already. So maybe the telemap ends up being a third or second line option.\n\n00:09:18,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n It definitely has raised the question about how is Sanofi going to manage that patent expiry. They have other drugs that we like, like Tolibrutinib. It's a pick a map.\n\n00:09:29,199 [SPEAKER_3]\n But currently the jury is out as to what this looks like for them in that timeframe and whether this is going to entice more MNA for drugs that will make a difference to that time period.\n\n00:09:46,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, it's interesting how in large cap biotech, you can have these big, complicated companies that still at the end of the day feel like they trade like small caps where only one or two products matter to people. A competitor emerges and suddenly there's this big new bear case. And so, yeah, something to watch. Speaking of companies growing up into large caps, Greg, you wanted to talk a little about Insmed, where there was a big week here too. So I'll leave that to you.\n\n00:10:11,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks, uh, Paul. Yeah, I do want to take a few minutes to talk about one of the most exciting companies in my coverage universe that's a new Jersey-based company called Insmed. It's probably really more of a mature, later-stage commercial pharmaceuticals company. But for those who don't know Insmed, it is a respiratory disease company. It's got a drug called Aracase. has been on the market for seven years now. It treats a specific lung disease that's caused by mycobacterial infection, and it is on track to generate, by our estimate, it's over $400 million in revenue this year. But the company has had just a monster of a year this year. The stock is up over 100%. It's more than doubled. It's got a market cap of incredibly over 30 billion. So that's really no small feat when you double your market cap and you're that big already. So while it's a commercial stage company, our and investor excitement really lies not necessarily in the prospects of the approved drug era case, which I just mentioned. but it lies in two new products.\n\n00:11:13,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n First, there's a drug called Brenzocatib for which positive phase three data were announced last year.\n\n00:11:21,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n And the stock since that data readout is up over 500%. Brentso Catib, it just got approved last month and is now known as Brentso Catib. As Brinsupre, and it's for a condition called bronchiectasis. There are no FDA-approved or there were no FDA-approved drugs for this condition.","char_start":7185,"char_end":11414,"start_time":"00:07:33","end_time":null}

Brentso Catib, it just got approved last month and is now known as Brentso Catib. As Brinsupre, and it's for a condition called bronchiectasis. There are no FDA-approved or there were no FDA-approved drugs for this condition.\n\n00:11:41,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n The company is projecting peak sales in this indication of at least $5 billion. That has been a main reason for the excitement by the market. Again, it's a drug that's just launching now. And then, secondly, Innsmed's got another drug. It's a pipeline drug that's called TPIP. It's a me better. Of the United Therapeutics Tyveso, which has been on the market for over 20 years now. But Innsmed this year in June reported a positive phase. phase II data in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH. Those data were far better on efficacy than we and the biocides had anticipated, and that provided yet another positive catalyst for the stock. The shares moved about 30% higher back in June when those data were announced. There have been some other recent catalysts for the company that have helped move the stock. Again, the approval of Brenzocatib. And again, that drug is now called Brin. Supri, but the label was really clean.\n\n00:12:44,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n Product pricing was well received by the market. So that was a catalyst just last month.\n\n00:12:51,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n Last week, and we talked about United Therapeutics Tyveso product. Well, United had tested— or just ran a first phase three study. For Tyveso in the setting of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF, there are a lot of questions whether Tyveso would work in IPF. But it did in a first phase three study. There's a second study that's ongoing. I think that's going to read out perhaps early next year. But that data sent United Therapeutics. stock up 30% plus. Again, that's no small company. And there were positive read-throughs for Innsmed. So with a view that we're ever tight. Tivezo might work. Enzmed's TPIP drug, which works very similarly, wherever Tivezo works, it's likely that T-DPIP may work there as well. So Innsmed shares moved up another 7% on that positive read-through. So overall, it's just been a really great run for Innsmed.\n\n00:13:53,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, fascinating. And big week recently too. So good stuff, Craig. Thank you. John, do you want to talk about, oh, anyone want to add anything there?\n\n00:14:03,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, maybe let's keep going because we got a lot of news. So, John, do you want to talk about the APOC3 data and the big readout from IONIS and the Arrowhead update? And I think, you know, you're the most topical or one of the most topical people to talk about this with, given we've got another ASO versus RNAi uh uh cage match here emerging in a big uh cardiometabolic indication. So I'll leave it to you for to start it off.\n\n00:14:26,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, it seems like RNAi and ASOs want to arm wrestle all the time, but it's all linked to the same phenomenon, of course. At the end of the day. But Ionis presented phase three data from their core studies with olizarcin, which is their ApoC3 targeting antisense oligonucleotide. It's a GalNac conjugated ASO that is given once a month. And the data were fantastic. They really were. I had to tip my hats off to my friends over at Ionis.\n\n00:15:05,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Frig lowering was ranged between 50 to 70%. They tested two different doses and, depending on the dose and the patient population and the two different studies, there was meaningful triglyceride lowering.\n\n00:15:18,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I think most importantly was the reduction in acute pancreatitis events. And this has been the— the real question in the field of triglyceride lowering, especially with the APOC3 mechanism, which is: will you get a signal on acute pancreatitis? Which obviously, as a clinical endpoint, would be very meaningful, not only from a patient's unmet need perspective, I mean, pancreatitis is a very severe condition or event and could be life-threatening as well.\n\n00:15:55,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n You can potentially develop a drug in the severe hypertriglyceridemia setting without having to go to an outcome study, which would be challenging.","char_start":11114,"char_end":15368,"start_time":"00:11:41","end_time":null}

Even the Veskipa story was itself controversial. So Ola Darsan looks very promising, and that's a phase three study, and I'm sure this product will get on the market now. You know, we'll have to see what the safety data really look like. We haven't seen very much from that yet, but that does look encouraging. And then our friends at Arrowhead are developing an SRNA targeting APOC3, which is a couple of years behind Olazarsan. And in this case, they had open-label data from their Palisade um phase two study where they you know showed sustained reductions in pancreatitis events um where the over a two-year period Thank you. The event rate was around 20% for the placebo group, and it was reduced down to 4% for the plozasterine group.\n\n00:17:09,839 [SPEAKER_1]\n is going to be given once a quarter. So it looks like another showdown between these two mechanisms.\n\n00:17:19,849 [SPEAKER_1]\n Dose level. I mean, Lpzaciran is associated with a more significant reduction of triglycerides by far compared to Olizarcin. And this is—this is setting up the same type of story we're going to see with Lp in about a year or two years' time between the Horizon study that's being run by by Novartis with an Ionis-derived LP little a drug called Pelocarsin, as well as the the Olpasteran drug that Amgen is developing, which also came out of Arrowhead. So that'll be another showdown. That two is also one where the ASA. So it was a little bit ahead of the SRNA. But again, we'll show some interesting, it'll be interesting to see the pharmacology and clinical results with that product as well. So that's the story, but great to see the innovation happening on this target with ApoC3 and wonderful to see the consistency of reduced pancreatitis events across the two different drugs.\n\n00:18:25,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, John. So, you know, maybe some questions for you, given you spent a lot of time in the cardiometabolic space and obviously, you know, these drugs well, and you've. Do you feel like this is a market that small companies can tackle well independently? I think the one thing that I've struggled with, as someone who covers Ionis, and obviously, you follow Zero Head out of competitive interest here, is it feels like this is not a KOL market. Like, the KOLs love these drugs, but to make this a big class, you probably got to go a lot more broad. Is that a fair?\n\n00:18:58,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n Is that a fair depiction of the space? What do you think?\n\n00:19:00,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think so. I think that's going to be the commercial challenge that both. That both Ionis and Arrowhead will have to face here, if they, as they bring these products to market, get them closer to market, you know, how will they commercialize them? It's going to be a different type of commercialization effort compared to other drugs that they've commercialized, not Arrowhead, but Ionis. Now, at the beginning of their work in familial chylomicronemia syndrome, which is an ultra-orphan linked to APOC3. and trigs, but very very different when you think about expanding into this severe hypertrig market and and and recurrent pancreatitis, which you know is really more of a prevalent disease. By setting and so I think those companies are going to have to make decisions around their go-to-market strategy and how they do it, if they do it and and how they partner eventually.","char_start":15068,"char_end":18865,"start_time":"00:15:55","end_time":null}

I mean, I think just to add some context to on the stock. I mean, Ionis had a huge move this week. The data. A lot better than expected. And I think one thing the investment community is. is assuming is that with this outcomes benefit on pancreatitis, maybe the price in the model goes up significantly. I think they've been talking about the $20,000 range, but perhaps that could be really conservative. I mean, John, do you feel like— Because, you know, I think we're all assuming the event rates in pancreatitis in these studies are low. So even though you've got this big reduction, it's not. Know we're not talking about 100 events here, probably not even 50. Right, like, do you feel like that kind of data, if it's on the label, adds significant pricing power to this class?\n\n00:20:44,190 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, it certainly does, but it's also going to be associated with the narrowing of the patient population that get treated.\n\n00:20:54,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so you're going to have a trade-off if there's significant change on the pricing side of it into the five digits.\n\n00:21:04,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, I don't think it's going to get much higher than five digits, but certainly into the five-digit level, you're going to have a significant reduction of the price of the patient population that gets treated with the drug. So that trade-off would have to be considered.\n\n00:21:20,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I think the go-to-market strategy will still require some good thinking. I mean, this is going to be beyond just a KOL, you know, lipid specialist type market at the end of the day.\n\n00:21:34,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep. Yep. Okay. Very interesting. And I guess, John, do you know when we're going to get the Arrowhead phase three readout?\n\n00:21:41,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't. I don't. I believe that there's been no guidance on it so far, Paul.\n\n00:21:49,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n I feel like it's in the next year or something like that, so a little behind.\n\n00:21:52,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think at least that. It might even be a little bit longer.\n\n00:21:55,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, okay, all right, very good, well, sam, you wanted to talk a little about obesity readouts, and then I am just very interested in kind of a broader discussion here around how the investment community has been reacting to some of the obesity data sets. I have no skin in the game. I don't cover any obesity stocks, but I'm highly interested. I've been meeting with companies in the space. I recently met a company, Kylara, that's private. Buddy Ron Renault is the CEO and so I'm very very interested. I guess I'm I'm a little surprised as an outsider looking in at how sensitive these stocks are when a drug misses a bogey on weight loss by like two or three percent because I just can't think of any market. Um, for drugs that are you know, outside of oncology or these kind of life-threatening diseases, where you know, these tiny differences in efficacy actually drive you know, the almost existential existence of a drug as being commercially viable. So that's that's the broader conversation I wanted to have here. But Sam, maybe you can review and I would love your perspective, too, on just.\n\n00:22:58,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n how trigger-happy investors seem to be on whether data hits the bogey or not and kind of the perceived implications.\n\n00:23:05,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I mean, Paul, we're dealing with companies that were sitting at valuations that were never seen in the large pharma world—right, Johnson and Johnson? Perhaps always led the market cap range for large pharma, and then we had Forks of Liddy heading out to a trillion dollars. Could it be the first trillion? So when you have situations like that, you do end up in these kind of swings. And of course, Novo Nordisk was sitting up there in the 7800. Danish Krone range.

Sorry, I look at the European name.\n\n00:23:32,500 [SPEAKER_3]\n Is it the zero-sum game? But it kind of looks like it, right? In terms of when you add up all these market caps and see where things are. And at the end of the day, there's a population out there that needs to get treated. There's a bunch of drugs out here that are supply constrained, most of them, although that's being addressed.\n\n00:23:49,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n In the beginning, but a lot of these things are trading on there. What's it going to look like in 28, 29, 30? So what sort of data have we seen in the past? Three weeks. I mean, the massive moves have kind of calmed down a little bit, but we had no one notice come out with. a real world type study although honestly I'm not sure it's real world but um Showing that. there we go via 2. 5 milligram, 4 milligrams had a 57 greater reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, etc. Maze.\n\n00:24:24,399 [SPEAKER_3]\n than to Zapatite. And I'm sitting there thinking, how can that be possible? I mean, never saw that in the in the] um rcts in the randomized control trials and the the reality is the follow-up was short, etc. but it all points to the direction of they're doing everything they can to give themselves some kind of marketing edge or power to be able to fight each other on this, which talks to your zero-sum game. But. In the end, it all came down to, you know, share price was up a little bit, Liddy was down a little bit. And we do know, I think people realize in the end that you have to take this with a pinch of salt. It was retrospective database analysis, not really a real world study. And we really have no idea what people were dosed at for trisepatite. So quite a lot of unknown in there, although it caught the headlines. And then, of course, just before that, we'd had the two oral data sets, one from Lenny, this time their share price didn't tank.\n\n00:25:27,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n Because I think that set expectations correctly, so this was in the diabetics attained to obese diabetics. And the pill showed a 10. 5% weight loss versus 2. 2% for placebo. And remember, a whole bunch of people have got used to the 22%, 23%, 25% targets that people are talking about for the injectables. It seems like that folks are now getting to accept that the orals are not going to give you, at least these small molecule orals, the right sort of that sort of level of weight loss. And maybe you don't need that. You know, it's always been our view.\n\n00:26:02,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think if others are chiming into this as well, that those those weight loss levels are just crazy high and you probably don't need that, especially if you're thinking about a maintenance setting. The problem for this was that the tolerability wasn't great. But it's very clear that they've got a product that they can get to market that doesn't need a peptide. It's a true small molecule. So they should have a good positioning versus oral semma from anovo, which is coming to market probably just a few months before it does need to be taken in a fasting state, which is a particular drawback. And lastly, I'll say.\n\n00:26:42,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n On this is that then Viking had the venture world.\n\n00:26:46,650 [SPEAKER_3]\n data, which was a phase two. which is also a pill. And that came out with a 12% weight loss, which at 13 weeks, which is probably the best in class we've seen. The problem is they also had their best in class. That's not quite right. Worst in class. If you want to say that, tolerability profile, which was pretty hefty, 28% in the patients on the drugs stopping treatment versus 18% on placebo. So they need to do some work there on the dosing, but there certainly seem to be skin in the game for. Viking in terms of laurels. So all this adds up to, again, a bunch of drugs coming along. We go via intrazepidide, semaglutazepidide still being the key drugs out there. And everything else that comes in is going to have to fill in as to where it's going to fit. Is it maintenance? Is it cycling? That has to be worked out still.\n\n00:27:42,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sam, how big are you guys now estimating this category to be at peak?

And have you guys lowered those numbers at all in the past year?\n\n00:27:49,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, I'm just looking at my colleagues. Note out, Lily, to outpace Novoa's obesity sales hits 100 billion in 2030. It has not. And we've done an enormous amount of work on our EPI. To the point of, I think the poor guy is, this is Mike Shaw, my colleague. He's now modeling country by country in Europe, which, of course, you can't follow, but he's done that effort.\n\n00:28:14,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that's always fun until the reported results come in and you can't update the model.\n\n00:28:19,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n I know, I know. But that's awesome.\n\n00:28:23,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n He's done the work. I respect that. Greg, you cover a couple of stocks in this space. And John, if you have any views, too, I mean, if you're kind of thinking about a small company in this area where where's the room for differentiation and can a small company even really compete with these big guys?\n\n00:28:39,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, Paul, that's a great question. I mean, we do know you talked about being a private company, Kylera. There's a host of smaller companies that obviously are looking at the huge tan. That's involved in the obesity game. You know, Sam just mentioned $100 billion in sales for perhaps one product.\n\n00:28:57,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n But I do think, though, you know, I don't cover Eli Lilly. I don't cover Novo, but I do cover a couple of smaller companies that are in early stage programs. One in particular is called Terns Pharmaceuticals. They're a Bay Area company that's got an oral GLP-1. We're going to have phase two data in the fourth quarter, so that's an upcoming catalyst. and data events for folks to maybe pay attention to. And then I cover another small company called Corebus Pharmaceuticals and their interrogation. The old CB1 mechanism of action that for many of those who may have been around way back when remembers Santa Fe's Ramona Bond. Um and kind of the uh the saga that was Ramona Bonds back in in the mid 2000s um you know we we just did a call for clients um last week with two obesity kols just to get their sense of where we are in the current GLP-1 market, you know, there are a lot of investor debates around the terzapatide versus\n\n00:30:00,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n hemagglutide kind of battle.\n\n00:30:04,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n And, you know, we spent some time on kind of what is the need, if there is indeed a need, and I would say some of the high-level points are that, look, the GLP-1s certainly have been revolutionary. Obviously, they were in diabetes first and obesity second. I think, on the because that's what we're focused on here.\n\n00:30:27,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n It does seem that, because of greater potency, you know, Lily's appetite is probably being used a little bit more right now, although there are some reimbursement challenges. Certainly, semaglutide is doing well enough. and it's not necessarily a dynamic where we're seeing patients getting switched off of semaglutide necessarily if they're already, you know, doing relatively well, but I do think that this reimbursement issue right now is probably the biggest challenge. At least that's what our KOLC we spoke with said, particularly in the obesity side of things. And we've also got down the road potential cuts to medicare and medicaid spending here in the US and they highlighted that's going to be a particular challenge, you know, these aren't terribly inexpensive drugs. We do have compounded versions.\n\n00:31:27,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n I know each of the companies are trying to introduce or promote their own direct to patient services, and that is lowering the cost. But I think that's where the excitement and the promise of the oral versions of the drugs will come in. They are small molecules. They should be way cheaper to manufacture. And you would argue that that should provide the companies that are introducing orals. And obviously, Lily is in the lead right now with or for GLP-1, but you would assume that they would be able to price uh these GLP-1 ones at least the oral versions um more attractively to really drive much broader uptake here, particularly in the US.","char_start":26666,"char_end":31064,"start_time":"00:27:42","end_time":null}

Yes, Sam did. Highlight the fact that perhaps the efficacy isn't as great as the injectables. Interestingly, the side effects do appear worse.\n\n00:32:33,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I think some of the reasons biologically that might be happening are still under some debate, but it's really going to be a much lower cost. That's going to. really drive uptake. And I think this perspective is really important as we think about the potential future of the orals is like, when you think about it, a lot of obesity is probably treated at the front line by your GPs or your PCPs. And, you know, PCP is, you know. They like writing prescriptions for things that patients can just go pick up at their local. pharmacy whether it be a cvs or walgreens or whatever the case may be here in the us um you know they typically don't write for a lot of um injections and typically they will refer these patients to the endocrinologist who who are much more comfortable with injections So, yes, there are debates around the efficacy and safety tolerability of the orals, but I do think there is a growing consensus view that whenever the orals do come out.\n\n00:33:39,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n They, from a pure dollar perspective, are likely to generate more dollars than the injectables just because of the broader uptake that you could see in a broader patient population, because of the lower cost. Where is there opportunity to differentiate is going to be very interesting again. We've got phase 2 data for turns is oral one coming next. month. We've got some initial data from Corbus and their CB1 later this year, but really we probably won't get a real read on efficacy until next year. Again, we won't go into detail as to the issues around or legacy issues with the CB1s, but I do think that there are reasons to believe. that doctors are looking for other things, particularly on the muscle sparing side. And so I do think that there is room for other medicines. It's not just a race. Awesome. Great overview.\n\n00:34:37,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n John, anything else?\n\n00:34:38,929 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would just maybe push back a little bit on Greg's views on the pricing side of it.\n\n00:34:47,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n But first of all, I do think the verdict is still out on the orals vis-a-vis the tolerability and the degree of efficacy. And I think that that's going to be challenging when you think about going to an expanded population with the orals. But I also wonder and would find it challenging if I were in Dave Rick's shoes or the CEO of Novo Shoes, whose name I forget, you know, regarding.\n\n00:35:18,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n How likely they would be to think dramatically differently on pricing with an oral in a market that is such a huge growing segment for their business. So, you know, I think it's a little bit more complicated than Greg, as you painted it to be. But let's see. Let's see how it all plays out.\n\n00:35:36,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just a quick thing, for the avoidance of doubt, the 100 billion wasn't just Lilly and Wegovy. There's a whole bunch of drugs that we've modelled in there, such as Kagrisema, ritatratide, sumidatide, other GLP-1s, and orals. And just last point on the oral pricing thing, John, the only thing is that they are not the only game in town in terms of orals. So maybe some of the new ones coming along. Would play the pricing game, but I don't remember that being the way that new drugs come to market or folks using pricing.\n\n00:36:11,750 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, not last time I remembered.\n\n00:36:13,290 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah.\n\n00:36:18,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, very good.

Yeah.\n\n00:36:31,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, no— just real. It was obviously a piece of news that came out this week, and I don't want to toot my horn on on this call, but just comment on it real briefly. I mean, first of all, Clive and I have worked for like 30 30 years now. So we did the original deal that I did with him back in 1997 was for Angiomax, which I invented and then and licensed it to Clive. And, you know, he built the medicines company on largely on the, on the foundation of, of angiomax. And then, and then in 2013, We did a deal when I was at Al-Nalam with Clive on Eclisiran, which became Lectio, and he sold Medicines Company for about $10 billion. Of artists and we actually turned around and monetized half the royalties for a couple billion dollars so we've had a strong track record of getting stuff done and this this is our third act together which which is always the best act, as I'm told, for my theater friends. So we're excited about it. I mean, it's focused on cardiovascular prevention.\n\n00:37:31,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n And it's really based on the increasing recognition that ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, is really a a problem of cumulative exposure, not exposure at one point in time. It's not that somebody has an elevated blood pressure on a given day or elevated LDL, but the fact that their lifelong exposure to elevated levels of LDL and blood pressure, along with other factors, really drive atherosclerosis, development of plaque, and that by lowering LDL and blood pressure much, much earlier in life, you can have a profound impact. On improving cardiovascular health status, essentially taking cardiovascular disease off of your tombstone if you start early enough for those. People that are, especially for those people that are at higher risk. So super cool, super important, could be the most, frankly, the most important thing I've ever gotten involved.\n\n00:38:38,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n From a public health perspective. And the basic approach is to use a tool that we're building using AI and large datasets like UK Biobank, working together with Brian Forenz, who is an expert. Cardiologist but also an expert in causal AI to predict people that are at elevated risk— we call that Clotho Health, which is a nod to the Greek myth that determined people's lifespan, and to combine that predictive tool with an annual sRNA that targets both PCSK9 and angiotensinogen for for LDL and blood pressure lowering, respectively. And of course, obviously, think about how this gets from a commercial perspective, how this gets to market, and think a lot about the emerging channels that we're all talking about earlier, about consumer-based channels, but there may be conventional channels as well. But pricing that is consistent with a prevention type approach, not a treatment type approach, and look at pricing in the flu vaccine space, for example, as an example of how you would imagine this.\n\n00:39:52,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n But super cool. First program will start in the clinic in a month. So we're already pretty advanced. We've been doing this stealthily for the last two years.\n\n00:40:00,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n John, how do you think about this versus like a gene editing type approach, which has some of the same sort of public health ambitions.","char_start":34616,"char_end":38199,"start_time":"00:36:13","end_time":null}

I mean, we're really targeting people that are in their 40s and 50s who are otherwise healthy, but are not yet at guideline recommendation level. To start treating with the statin or to start treating with an antihypertensive drug, but can be predicted to be at risk of future ASCVD and future heart attack. And there's just no way, I think, that somebody of that phenotype would consider a gene editing approach, at least not for a while, which requires intravenous infusion and high cost of treatment and so forth. I just don't see that as being competitive. I'm very excited about where gene editing can go in more morbid populations, maybe in the treatment of people with heterozygous FH, which obviously itself a very important opportunity.\n\n00:41:14,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n But we want to go upstream with a treatment, a therapy that can cost hundreds of dollars per annual dose, not what they would have to charge at the end of the day.\n\n00:41:26,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, I mean, look, I think a really good analogy to what you're saying is look at the time from when RNAi led to a Nobel Prize versus the time to win in Clissaran was approved, right? I mean, it takes time to figure this kind of stuff out. It sure does.\n\n00:41:41,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul, John, can you just double click on this pricing ambition? It's very rare that companies at this stage of their development talk about their ambitions as regards pricing. And you have, and you're not talking about. Anywhere near even what I suppose an oral PCSK9 would be or whatever. Yeah, but this is, uh, and and does this need a companion diagnostic that would that is coming out of the um Biobank study?\n\n00:42:10,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so we're certainly not looking to make it a companion diagnostic. And we want to think about it. How we introduce this AI tool commercially, you know, probably in advance, in advance of, oh, I'm hearing some background. Anyway, it would be in advance. Of the drug getting to market. But we definitely want to stay away from making it a companion diagnostic. On the pricing side, Sam, I mean, look, the bottom line is we want to develop this as a primordial prevention medicine. And it's hard not to talk about pricing when you're talking about a concept that would be used in otherwise well people.\n\n00:42:57,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so it is, vaccine-like. I know the vaccine word is a bad word these days. I don't think it is. But it is vaccine-like in terms of how you think about it from a public health perspective, which is very, very different from a therapeutic.\n\n00:43:12,819 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very good. I think I'm going to shuffle things around a bit because I want to make sure we do have time to cover some of the more topical news, speaking of the word vaccine, just as it relates to the Trump True Social post, RFK in front of Congress.\n\n00:43:26,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, maybe we can have a five-minute discussion on that before, um, before maybe Sam. You can preview World Long, and I can talk about some neuro events coming in in September. But John, do you want to just introduce this topic for us?\n\n00:43:41,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, you know, I actually got heads up on it from Matt Herper, who called me on on on on this because he was writing a story he wrote a story on Trump's Truth Social. I don't follow him on Truth Social, thankfully. Say. But it was an interesting post because he- commented on the amazing data that he was seeing from Pfizer and others that called it extraordinary.\n\n00:44:07,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n And you really get the sense that. And he talks about Operation Warp Speed, which is absolutely, I'll give him all the credit in the world for Operation Warp Speed and what it did to bring vaccines, COVID vaccines to the market.

I applaud him.\n\n00:44:26,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n And in a very, very strong manner for doing what happened there. But you really get the sense from this. This True Social post that there is some anxiety in the MAGA world, I guess, in the MAHA world as well, on this topic. And the CDC being, quote, unquote, ripped apart, as he calls it. And then, of course, we had just yesterday Kennedy's testimony. On the Senate and the Health Committee. And you certainly get the sense of increasing anger toward what's going on at the CDC. And what's going on with vaccines in general. So I get the sense that all of this is coming to a head in a big way. And who knows where it goes?\n\n00:45:15,720 [SPEAKER_1]\n We'll have to see, but but there is um. Really, I think a lot of this is coming to a head for good reasons. I think a lot of the public is very concerned around their access to vaccines.\n\n00:45:27,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n I can't get my COVID vaccine yet in Massachusetts, and I think that's ridiculous.\n\n00:45:33,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so people are seriously concerned.\n\n00:45:36,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep. Yeah. Look, we've talked about this on. A number of episodes right and how this kind of flows through to behavior too and you know, my experience recently with us having another child and just seeing the way the vaccine decisions were framed early on was so different to me than what we had experienced the first time around. Sam, you wanted to comment just a little bit on like vaccine development paths. I think there was some news around things that the FDA has been communicating to certain companies. And we're all wondering if that's going to be extrapolated more broadly. Do you want to chime in here?\n\n00:46:10,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sure. I mean, just on the previous point, though, Paul, what is strange here is that, of course, these ACIP meetings that have been significantly changed, I think, by the shifts that RFK has made or Secretary Kennedy has made in the makeup of the ACIP always had plenty of data showing how good these COVID vaccines have been, even three years post.\n\n00:46:37,790 [SPEAKER_3]\n The operation warp speed so the president only needs to look at its own, his, the secretary's own ACIP meetings to look for that data. Economic analysis and everything. I don't know what exactly was there. But we'd be interested to see if this changes. Back to the FDA. I just literally heard. Um, uh, Mackery talk about uh how children have died due to the vaccine on CNN. It's this clip that's on that he posted himself on X. So what's interesting is there's this constant back and forth between what the administration wants, what the people want, what the companies need to do, and what the CDC, et cetera, are asking for. And then the FDA, through Prasad, have put out requests for post-marketing trials and tests and placebo-controlled trials, which the companies are having to do. To prove that their vaccines are still effective on a placebo-controlled basis in the booster setting, to prove that there's no circulate.\n\n00:47:45,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n circulating spike protein after mRNA vaccination. I don't see why circulating spike protein is going to tell us anything at all, but we'll find out. But this, of course, makes it difficult where revenue is going down for these guys. Because of the pressure on vaccines. Costs are going to go up because they have to keep doing these trials. I don't know how many. Does it have to happen every year? But it's all in the letters that came out for all three vaccine makers, Novavax, Moderna and Biontech. And then, of course, what does this mean for other vaccines? We do have ACIP coming up next on the 18th. And of course, in the meantime, we're going to have this report come out as to. What's causing autism? So I give you a choice as to what you think is going to be in that research.

Okay, uh, fun, fun, fun times. I guess I, I, guess um, Sam, do you want to talk about world long and then Greg and I are going to talk about how in this fall we have a bunch of readouts coming up in the neurology space.\n\n00:49:04,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, so I'll make sure you've got plenty of time for that. You've got two key datasets that we're looking at. Of course, the world of biotech is looking at, and I think maybe even investors in Merck. are highly focused on what's going to happen with even isomab in this trial that's reading out the harmony trial— the headline of the abstracts, even isomab versus placebo plus chemo, phase three in patients with EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer that have progressed essentially on Tagresa. So what are we looking for here? Obviously, we're looking for an OS, which has got a confidence interval not passing one. And hopefully it's in the 0. 75 to 0. 8 region in terms of hazard ratio. But the more critical element here is that split between China and ex-China data. This trial, that Summit conducted, at the last count, at least, had about 38% of patients that were not. Um, that were ex-China, so the critical thing here is for us to to to continue to see a similarity between those data sets.\n\n00:50:06,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n Obviously, this would be subgroup analysis, etc. So not really meaningful from aside from making us feel comfortable that you can take China data and translate directly to us. Now it's in a plenary, there's presidential, it's a presidential, sorry. So all the hopes are that it's going to be looking good. So let's wait and see. Sunday morning. Of course, from a commercial perspective, it's not particularly relevant, or maybe for some at the Nakito it's relevant, but there are other competitors out there. Johnson & Johnson, Rami Rantamab in this setting, post-Tagriso progression. You've got TROP2 ADCs coming along and other bispecifics. So not really that excited about the commercial potential. And the other thing is, obviously, AstraZeneca.\n\n00:50:56,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n OS readout for its trial, FLORA2, which is first-line Tigriso plus chemo. That's important for Astra because it's being—pressed perhaps a little bit uh— with by Johnson and Johnson's Riverbank Screen Sub Q in the first line setting. And our hope is that, I think the company said, statistically and clinically meaningful improvement. So we're looking for a meaningful, chunky hazard ratio here. Also at the same presidential.\n\n00:51:30,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n And there's a whole bunch of biotechs readouts there, Nuvation being one of them, share prices up 18% today. New Valent data etc. So looking forward to all that.\n\n00:51:42,749 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, excellent. Thank you, Sam. So Greg and I both cover a good deal of stuff in the neurology space and neuro is. Close to my heart since I was a lab tech right out of college in a sleep lab in Boston and now I've been covering this space for a long time. And so Greg has some readouts too. You know, I mean, I think maybe I'll kick it off, Greg, and we can just kind of take turns. I mean, I think one thing is that we are focused on right is how big of a say six to nine months it may be for Alzheimer's.

I think one readout that investors are looking towards, where there's a debate on whether it could could really boost this class, is Lilly's prevention study. And for context, both Biogen, Esai, and Lilly are running trials for licanumab and dinenumab, looking at patients that are essentially pre-symptomatic. The premise being: if you treat earlier, you can have a bigger clinical effect. For Lily, we don't know when we're going to get the readout, but there is— potentially an interim at some point, right? And again, it's hard, from the outside looking in, to really know, but theoretically, it could come any time. You know, I think, from our perspective, we think that these studies are fairly likely to work. I think, if you look at the history of a beta-antibody drug development, the history is really— we had some early setbacks, but once you found the right patients, being patients that are earlier stage and biomarker positive. Once companies were comfortable to push the dose of these ABANA antibodies high enough where they could dose through ARIA, you were able to see significant efficacy, right? And I know the efficacy is debated, but it feels likely that going even earlier, right, will be beneficial.\n\n00:53:26,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think the overarching question here is still whether this model is commercially viable. It's already hard— from a capacity perspective— to treat the patients who have the disease. There's already questions around risk-benefit with ARIA. And I think those questions, even if the rates are lower, could still be salient with earlier-stage patients. And then I think the other question is just, you know, how do you find people who are pre-symptomatic? If you look at What Lilly has disclosed around their trial and the screen rates or screen failure rates, I mean, they're screening out almost 90% of patients. And so I still think that we might be in a situation where these data could be good, but the tangible impact may take time to come to fruition. But that is something that's very interesting. And then the other two this year that I think are high profile and I will be more brief is. Bristol's Alzheimer's psychosis readout for CAR XT. I think that's something where we've been pretty, and I covered Carina. We've been pretty optimistic the drug should work. The whole question is whether you can get to a tolerable dose in a population that may be more sensitive to side effects. To that end, Novo's GLP-1 readout, which I'm sure Sam is closer to than me.\n\n00:54:30,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n From my perspective, from a neuro perspective, we're somewhat more cautious here. I feel like there's a lot of data out there showing GLP-1s may impact the probability of getting dementia. I don't know how that translates to patients who already have Alzheimer's, and I don't know. Whether you can decouple some of the data so far from just the broader impact that GLP-1s have on other conditions in these studies, right, like diabetes and things like that. And so, you know, maybe that's one that's a little bit higher risk, but certainly a big deal. And if that actually did work, right, I mean, it could be more problems for the. for the ABA antibodies. So Greg, I know you're watching some other stuff in Alzheimer's too. Maybe I'll turn it over to you.","char_start":49213,"char_end":52881,"start_time":"00:52:22","end_time":null}

Maybe I'll turn it over to you.\n\n00:55:11,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks so much, Paul. Yeah, I also love the neuro space of PhD in neuroscience, had an opportunity to do BD and strategy at Biogen and Abdi. on their neuro efforts. And, you know, I do spend a lot of my time, maybe not so much looking from an Alzheimer's perspective from the DMT side. Of things, but I do end up spending a lot of my time looking at symptomatics for Alzheimer's disease. I think that, you know, it's always been interesting to hear about. The potential of symptomatics. It seems like the industry and investor focus has always been on the DMTs. And yes, that is probably the biggest unmet medical need. Just because we've got now a couple of DMTs does not mean that these patients still won't have symptoms like psychosis, like agitation. On the agitation side of things, I cover two companies in particular. I want to talk about Axome Therapeutics first. Axome is in New York City.\n\n00:56:11,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n you know, based commercial stage company. They've already got three drugs on the market, one for depression, one for treating excessive daytime sleepiness, and one for migraine. but the real investor excitement on Axome is around the ability to take their antidepressant. That drug is called Oveladine. and expand the label into treating agitation episodes for those who have Alzheimer's disease. And agitation is a real- big problem in Alzheimer's patients. It's the number one reason why, you know, family members move their, probably their parents. Loved ones who have Alzheimer's out of the home setting into some sort of supervised setting. And until about two years ago, we had no approved therapies for treatment of agitation specifically. We do have now one drug. It is an atypical antipsychotic and that is from Takeda and Otsuka. And that's Rick Salty.\n\n00:57:13,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n But as some of you may know, atypical antipsychotics all have a black box warning.\n\n00:57:21,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n The Black Box warning is around increased risk of mortality in elderly with dementia. And so we've got this paradox where we have one approved drug to treat, but there's a black box warning that basically is almost contraindicative of use in Alzheimer's patients.\n\n00:57:41,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n Axome is, they have run four late-stage studies for their antidepressant, which has been on the market for about two and a half years.\n\n00:57:51,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n have positive data sets from three of those for late-stage studies, and they are about to file, or the guidance is that they're going to file and SNDA for avelity for its potential use in Alzheimer's disease patients who experience agitation. We do think that's going to be a catalyst for the stock because there is some debate around the strength of the data. But I do think that on balance, there's enough data. I think that this is a division that is interested in getting more therapies for patients with Alzheimer's disease. We know that this neuro division has exhibited or demonstrated or exercised a certain regulatory flexibility when reviewing drugs. Particularly for neurodegenerative diseases. And with that said, we could have another drug on the market for Alzheimer's disease agitation. Sometime next year. So I think the acceptance of the SNDA will be an important catalyst for Axome stock.\n\n00:58:58,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n But that's also going to be something that, for patients and families and caregivers, over the next year, hopefully we'll get some newer symptomatics. And then the last thing that I'll mention, since we're talking about readouts, I also cover a company called Nomura Therapeutics. They are based in the Boston area. They do have a program for Alzheimer's disease agitation. It's a very interesting mechanism of action. It works very differently. It works on vasopressin receptors.\n\n00:59:28,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n And so it's quite novel and unique in that way. But we've got a proof of concept, kind of proof of signal readout that's expected by the end of this year. And with that said, I think, again, lots of unmet medical need in Alzheimer's disease. We're going to get readouts, as Paul mentioned, on the DMT side, but also on the symptomatic side.","char_start":52581,"char_end":57077,"start_time":"00:55:11","end_time":null}

And I know we're out of time, but some of the other ones we wanted to mention were. Know rapport's upcoming data and epilepsy. I know Daphne had kind of a point there around this being a biomarker study and how much do investors sort of ascribe value to biomarkers. You know, I think. What's interesting about this readout is that it was sort of originally framed purely as a biomarker readout, but as we've learned more about the population, and this is in refractory epilepsy. The street has become much more focused, I think, on the actual clinical seizure data there, given that they've shown the baseline frequency is relatively high and that's a drug we think has a good chance of success. Lastly, Unicure's Huntington's data coming out this month as well. They just had data from another program today. That's a big one for the gene therapy space. And also, if it is positive and they file, it'll be another big one to kind of. Help us figure out where we're at with CBER as it relates to kind of flexibility and whether or not a lot of the things that they've been saying lately that sound a lot like the Peter Marks doctrine will become true. So two other ones to watch. But thanks, everybody, for joining.","char_start":56777,"char_end":58340,"start_time":"00:59:50","end_time":null}

I'm Chris Garabedian, and my co-hosts today are Tess Cameron, Eric Schmidt, Sam Fazzelli, and Brad Loncar. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:22,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right, so we'll start with kind of the market environment. We had our first biotech IPO yesterday, LB Pharma, a company that's developing a schizophrenia drug that's in clinical stage. It was pretty good, well-received by the market. I'd say there was good price discovery there. It wasn't— you know, a high-flying, high-valued IPO that we saw. You know, in the in the high times. But it's held today and. You know, went up on the IPO yesterday. So I think it's overall a good signal. And then we saw a bunch of pipes and follow-on offerings this week of a large variety made. Did a $150 million pipe rapport following some phase two epilepsy data raised $250 million in a follow-on. Camp Four did a pipe of 50 to 100, up to 100 million. That was mostly a recap.\n\n00:01:23,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n They changed out the board to get enough money. Continue going. They were kind of in that microcap kind of area. And then Amelix raised $175 million to fund commercialization of their post-bariatric hypoglycemic drug, Avexatide. And then, um, maybe what got the most attention is avidity on the heels of their DM data, which led to a follow-on offering, and the market was hoping that they would be acquired before raising a large amount of capital. And so I think the market responded not liking the dilution and feeling that M&A is off the table. These are always tricky to read. Sometimes they're doing that to have negotiating leverage.\n\n00:02:09,289 [SPEAKER_1]\n Or to be able to show that they can go alone. So again, a lot going on in the markets.\n\n00:02:15,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n And before we move to M &A, any comments from the group?\n\n00:02:20,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, Brad, Eric.\n\n00:02:22,290 [SPEAKER_1]\n Test Sam on just the market environment that we're seeing this week.\n\n00:02:27,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'll just jump in with my usual story.\n\n00:02:31,369 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm hoping that a lot of this is driven by slightly more positive mood, because of the potential direction of interest rates, which is really weird to talk about. We talk about biotech, but it is what it is. And, you know, data has been positive. Share price reactions to good data have been great. It all sounds and feels like. We're in a relatively dare—I say normal environment, so I'd love to hear what the other folks think.\n\n00:02:58,740 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and I want to highlight, I mean, you know, it makes sense that when the sentiment changes like that, everybody rushes and, especially, some of these were on data catalysts to raise, but. It's always been difficult to predict how sustained it is. If this is just one of those short windows, that you know, everybody raises a bunch and then we kind of pull back. But um, you know, Brad, you have any thoughts on this?\n\n00:03:22,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I.\n\n00:03:23,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n I was at the H. C. Wainwright conference for Biotech TV, and I interviewed the head of banking there. And of course, they traditionally bank smaller-type companies.\n\n00:03:37,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n He had like a golden quote about what's going on right now. He's like, 'Look for the last two years. Our companies have been in survival mode. And now they're actually thriving.' Like, they're aggressive about, you know. We want to add to our pipeline, or, you know, we have important data and we think we can raise. So, for the first time and years, the mood was not just like, 'How do we survive this?' It's, you know, you know what? Let's go after it, basically.\n\n00:04:11,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that was a good interview, Richard Gormley, who's been a banker for many, many years. And the XBI also, I mean, I know we know it's not the best representative of the broader. Market, but it's in the 90s that it's kind of teetering on that 100th.

Dollar you know we needed to kind of break out beyond that, but um, Eric, test you guys have any comments on this?\n\n00:04:31,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, maybe just that I would agree with both Brad and Sam that things feel a lot better, certainly a hell of a lot better than they did six months ago. But it's still a touch and go kind of marketplace, right? I mean, I think. Chris, the names that you mentioned for the most part are companies that we're either recapping, which is certainly not a great thing to do, or companies that are at the upper half of the mid-cap spectrum with good data. So yes, we're seeing companies with good data and good results able to tap into the public markets. But I'd be a little bit cautious in thinking that it's game on for fundraising. Hopefully, it's not game on for fundraising. Hopefully. The market has a strong filter and sieve toward quality companies. We don't want to see what we saw three or four years ago. And I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon, by the way.\n\n00:05:20,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and I think private companies going IPO— I think that that's LB is one, maybe a data point of one. I think we're going to need to see some more kind of trend lines that. you know, for good companies that are deserving to go public that can pull off an IPO, a healthy IPO.\n\n00:05:39,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Test any comments before we go back to Eric on M &A.\n\n00:05:42,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I guess I just echo what Sam was sharing in terms of the environment for rates. I mean, we'll see where they go. We're not out of the woods yet on inflation, right? So I think everyone was. Um, uh, you know, positive on the not good employment report. Right and then CPI came out and like it wasn't looking good right. Um so I think that'll be. I think that the Fed is definitely in a tough spot and we'll have to see how that plays out in terms of. In terms of race, but at least that's a world that like. Biotech is kind of used to, right? We were living for several years and just kind of like, 'Oh, the macro thing is like interest rates and like the jobs report and like the inflation report.' And then we had this brief hiatus where it was like. 'No, no, no.' It's everything else that could happen, policy-related. And so if we get back to a world that is really more focused on rates, at least that is going to be a world that is much, you know, feels more normal for us.\n\n00:06:43,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and I'll just add: I mean, it's a little bit two sides of the coin because, you know, besides interest rates being high, keeping, you know, other investors away from biotech because it is a risky sector. It's one that's probably most mystifying to a lot of, you know, generalist investors, but the track record hasn't been great, other than the COVID bubble. If you go back, you know, three, five, or ten years. You know, we still don't have a great track record to show that, yeah, it's high risk, but, you know, they want to see the reward of putting allocations. Obviously, there's going to be. investors who are in private and public biotech, no matter what, in every season, the endowments, the pension funds, the foundations that have. You know tens and hundreds of billions of dollars under management, but you know it's— i think interest rates is a key factor, but i also think we need to show performance before everybody realizes are going to be missing out on biotech. Obviously, the other big area is M &A that can bolster our sector. And Eric, you want to talk about one of the big M &As we saw this week?\n\n00:07:45,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, hopefully there is at least a little bit of FOMO around this one. Chris, what you're referencing is Tourmaline being acquired by Novartis for $1. 4 billion. I think that was announced on Tuesday. Healthy premium here and they go almost 90 percent. Maybe not a lot of people were that familiar with tourmaline. They went public sort of through a reverse merger back in 2023. So their profile. And perhaps even their ownership wasn't as broad as some of the other venture-backed companies we've seen in this space.","char_start":4005,"char_end":8314,"start_time":"00:04:31","end_time":null}

Maybe, maybe two things in particular to note here: tourmaline is another spin-out from Pfizer, the asset here— an IL-6 antibody. Passy Betty Tug. I don't know how to pronounce these antibodies. I thought all the antibodies were supposed to end in 'mab', but Passy Betty Tug is. It's a tough one. Someone's got to explain to me why it's not something bad. Um, it's an IL-6 and again, it was an asset that Pfizer was developing for autoimmune disease, and And they decided to shelve it. Kudos to the team at Dermaline who found this and developed it through to phase three readiness for atherosclerotic disease. So this is going to go much the way of, say, Spring works or Cerebell assets from Pfizer that have then been monetized by others. And the other thing to note here is the Acquirer in Novartis. Novartis, we know, has been really keen and interested on in terms of tying inflammation to atherosclerosis for many years.\n\n00:09:22,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n Of course, they had Canakinumab. IL-1 beta antibody in the CANTOS study results, and they were hopeful many years ago. I'm sure Sam will remember this. They got CRL back in 2018. Despite positive data tying inflammation into a reduction in MACE. And they're coming back to the well, it seems, and looking at a slightly different mechanism. Hopefully, going to take this into phase three with maybe a better ending.\n\n00:09:48,439 [SPEAKER_1]\n Excellent. Well, I want to shift to You know. Tess, you mentioned it. There's been a lot of other macro issues besides interest rates holding the sector back. You know, to name a few, you know, you've had the FDA changes, you've had most favored nation, you've had tariffs, IRA before that, right? But I think the most talked about has been China in recent. And I want to open this up to the broader group here. There's been obviously a lot more, you know, deals with Chinese companies. There's been, you know, a lot more development programs coming out of China and then the executive order. This is kind of open discussion on all of those things. Brad, you followed the China market for a long time, probably more deeply than any of us. Over the many years, do you want to kick this off for us and then we'll go to Sam and Eric and others?\n\n00:10:40,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, so Rebecca Robbins and her colleagues at the New York Times wrote a story that dropped a couple days ago.\n\n00:10:48,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n Basically, what it said was that The Trump administration has been drafting an executive order. relating to China biotech and the New York Times actually had a copy of it. Um, And the gist is there's like two warring factions. Like, as we all know, the whole like China biotech story and all of the deal making and how quickly Chinese companies are able to do discovery in early clinical work is hugely beneficial to large pharmaceutical companies. They're able to get assets very cheap. and They're able to de-risk them in ways that they couldn't do if you did all of the early work here in the United States.\n\n00:11:31,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n They're lobbying the government to like not rock the boat on China biotech. And then on the other side.\n\n00:11:38,970 [SPEAKER_4]\n You have a handful of investors who are lobbying to basically tighten the screws and saying that it's going to hurt our biotech sector and jobs.\n\n00:11:51,949 [SPEAKER_4]\n Ultimately, of course, hurt their investments and everything.\n\n00:11:56,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n And so that's kind of, and that's kind of where it is right now. So the White House like responded to the New York Times and said that. This isn't like. Immediately happening right now, like they they made it sound like it was still kind of like a back burner executive order, but um. But the point is, these two polar opposite views of the world are lobbying. The Trump administration and um.\n\n00:12:22,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n At the harshest end of it. Like one thing that it mentioned that could be proposed is that the licensing deals that we see it could be mandatory that they would have to go through Scythias.","char_start":8014,"char_end":12511,"start_time":"00:08:17","end_time":null}

But to me, I would say that has the potential to like kill all of these deals because like. you could just make it so time and resource burdensome to go through that process.\n\n00:12:52,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n That it would really slow down deals like that. So that would, to me, be like the worst case scenario if you're an advocate for keeping things the way they are.\n\n00:13:02,150 [SPEAKER_4]\n And there's. all kinds of other proposals that are— you know— various shades in between, like, for example, um. Even though you need China data for late stage drug development, even though the FDA doesn't allow China data for, like, you know, to file on or for very late stage studies, you still can kind of start, like, a phase two in the US if you have, like, China data showing that, you know, that a drug is safe and looks to be effective in phase one. And so they could. make that—uh— they could have the FDA, you know, choose to basically ignore China data altogether in like all stages of drug development. So there's, like, various things that could happen. So, so anyway, we, you know, we don't know like. The timing of this and we don't know which side is going to win that argument, but um, I think it is. It was a big newsworthy article that, you know, that made it public that this debate is happening and an executive order had actually been drafted.\n\n00:14:11,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n We'll see what happens.\n\n00:14:13,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n I thought it was a well-written article that kind of gave the bigger picture view and the different factions. You were quoted in it, Brad. And, you know, yeah, it is interesting. The tech billionaires, if you will, right? You know, Peter Thiel, the guy who co-founded Palantir, was, has been vocal on Twitter about it. You've got Jared Kushner, you've got Koch brothers, and then you've got Sergey Brin, right? So not necessarily all from— the conservative side of the aisle— going up against pharma that seems to be very favorable of being able to do this. Sam, let me go to you with an ex-U. S. perspective. What's your take on all this?\n\n00:14:55,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, Chris, let's call me a global guy. I am ex-US, but I love the US and I come there as much as I can.\n\n00:15:04,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I'm, you know, obviously sitting in the UK, I'm in awe of US biotech, but I want to take— an angle here that I think is worthwhile considering. And if you're suffering from innovation, a lack thereof, for whatever reason, which I don't think US biotech is suffering. Um. It's not because someone else is better at innovation than you are. It's just if you've lost that power or the ability to do trials quickly, it doesn't change anything by shutting down somebody else and just carrying on the way you're doing. What we need is to speed things up in Europe and in the UK in terms of getting trials through. But I also want to highlight that. It's it's It's a disservice to patients if we block the entry of novel drugs. There's no rhyme or reason why the best drug for a disease has to be that found in the US or in Belgium or in France. Why is it potent? not possible that the best drug is found in China, which, of course, we've seen examples of.\n\n00:16:07,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n Karvikti ended up being that case.\n\n00:16:10,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Brukinza has ended up being that case. If you want to call it, I mean, these are discussable. And one of the ones I've just recently seen is this PD-1 inhibitor, which you go, what, PD-1, Sam? Surely that can't be right. Serp-Lulimab from Henleus. They developed it in China. They did a trial in Europe.

It ranks above in terms of clinical decision-making. and they're now doing a head-to-head comparison with tezo with tecentric in the US only in the US to show whether it is better or not in a head-to-head trial. If it shows to be better, which the data seems to suggest when you do cross-trial comparisons, why would we not want that for our patients? So, whatever happens here, there has to be some control over not curbing the access of patients to the best drugs. If that's kept, then whatever the US needs to do, Europe needs to do, they should do it. That's my stance.\n\n00:17:30,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I jump in?\n\n00:17:32,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, please, Brad.\n\n00:17:33,410 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sorry to jump right back in.\n\n00:17:38,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n I see both sides of this issue. I've spent a lot of time in China. I've invested in China. I created a China fund. I get it.\n\n00:17:49,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n But the.\n\n00:17:50,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n I will say this is.\n\n00:17:52,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n Nobody in our, everyone in our industry is doing what's in their best interest. And the job of our industry is to, you know, to further human health and medicine.\n\n00:18:05,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n That's obvious. We also, every time we have this discussion, nobody brings up the obvious counter argument.\n\n00:18:16,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n The obvious counter argument is like, what happened in China this week? China held a military parade that was attended by and celebrated by Putin and the North Korean dictator. It's a communist nation which you know many of us would argue is unethical and evil and many people around the world, especially in the United States, would describe China as our adversary. In the world. And so the counter argument has nothing to do with human health. The counter argument is: Do we want to fund the scientific advancement and the growth of the biotech sector? in this place that's contrary to our way of life.\n\n00:19:05,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n and potentially not just promote it and help grow it, but to the detriment of science and jobs and biotech. In our own country.\n\n00:19:17,350 [SPEAKER_4]\n That's not an insignificant counter-argument. That's something that— Especially if you're outside of our industry, if you're a politician whose job Our job is to think about human health. Their job is to think about everything, including those factors. It's not a an insignificant thing.\n\n00:19:38,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n to think about.\n\n00:19:40,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n But I guess just to build on some of the points that you raised. Like. The US set standards, right? The US set standards and says, like, here is what the FDA will accept. Here is the bar that you need to meet. In order to be sold in the US, right? And there's, you know, I think a lot of you know, um, worthwhile regulations both in place and being considered related to manufacturing that would also mean that there's less ability of maybe any one nation to turn off the switch on manufacturing.\n\n00:20:19,210 [SPEAKER_3]\n drugs that Americans rely on. So when we look at, like, you know, what is the U. S. doing to basically ensure? What would be bad for American citizens, right? What would be bad is if there were good drugs that they couldn't get. And it's bad if they can't get them. Either because. You know, they can't access those medications because they're made by a foreign adversary who's saying, like, 'We aren't going to sell these drugs in the US because we don't want to.' You know, U. S. citizens benefit from them. Similarly, it's like To Sam's point, well, U. S. citizens also don't benefit from them if our government makes that decision. And I do push back on the point about jobs because, you know, we have a lot of like super qualified biotech people here. But like, think about the new life and like the employment and the work that is being done by people as a result of like Oh, like our drug didn't work and now we can actually bring another asset in, and like our company can have this new life as a result of like us being able to access other innovation\n\n00:21:27,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n that is worldwide.","char_start":16085,"char_end":20558,"start_time":"00:16:34","end_time":null}

Those are kind of the counterarguments to your point. Which I think are like. important points and important considerations to make. That make me wonder about those.\n\n00:21:42,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Chris, I know you want to move on. One small comment.\n\n00:21:45,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, no, I want to add some elements that we're not talking about, but Sam, go ahead. Let me just do this.\n\n00:21:49,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's okay though, Brad. That NVIDIA and AMD can sell chips to China now if they pay 15 of that revenue back to the US. What happened there? So I think there needs to be some consistency. Suppose this executive order turns around and says, yeah, sure, we can bring drugs here from China. Once you develop them, I want 10% of their revenues. I don't know. I'm just making it up. So I can't disagree with you. I'm not going to go too into politics. But I'm still of the view that we have to let innovation happen where it is. By doing this, we're not going to change the system and the attitude of China. Fact, by not giving them the chips, you're going to force them to develop their own. And then we end up in a different world, completely different world. So look, it's very tough. Again, patience first.\n\n00:22:39,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'd like to highlight an area that we're not talking about, which I think is actually bigger than the whole geopolitical. I think there are good arguments that we're hearing on both sides of this.\n\n00:22:47,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n Look, innovation— I'm not concerned that the U. S. can compete with China on innovation, right? What we've seen in our industry, in recent times, is a crowding around. Validated targets, maybe too many products against validated targets moving into development. We've talked a lot about a lot of venture capitalists. Count myself in that, we tend to want to have more best-in-class, fast followers, better development strategies, bio-better products to move into the clinic to differentiate. But when it comes to real innovation, and I'm talking first-in-class, on the cutting edge, I'm not concerned right now that the US can't compete. on innovation. The challenge is really. What I saw most concerning recently is, you know, we as a sector. When the IPO window is open, great. We're all pretty happy. But when it's not, we have to rely on M &A.\n\n00:23:50,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n and big pharma for 20 plus years. has relied almost predominantly on buying U . S. biotechs for the most part to feed their pipeline to the tune of 50% or more. of their pipeline. Now we're starting to see deals where pharma is saying, wow, do we even need to go through U . S. biotech? Why don't we go straight to China? Let's do a collaboration like GSK-Hengrui. All right. Well, then, where does that push U. S.\n\n00:24:22,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n venture capital? Right. That means the U. S. has to really focus more on the innovation curve— right the first-in-class, which is higher risk higher reward if you get it right. But we know that discovery research is not easy. And so, I think the big concern for our sector is that pharma decides if they can go right to China. We don't really need U. S. biotech, right? We're still outsourcing our pipeline, but it's not to the U. S. venture back. Now, what we've seen in the last year is the U.S. Venture capitalists have been licensing in these China drugs. But. Then we see pharma saying, 'Well, we can go straight to them.' So I think that is a big issue. Where is if you were to stop.","char_start":20258,"char_end":24084,"start_time":"00:21:27","end_time":null}

Now, what we've seen in the last year is the U.S. Venture capitalists have been licensing in these China drugs. But. Then we see pharma saying, 'Well, we can go straight to them.' So I think that is a big issue. Where is if you were to stop.\n\n00:25:09,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n That ability, right? To license in those China drugs, I don't know necessarily that we're going to see a scenario where, 'Oh no,' US is not going to have access to any good drugs, it's all going to be locked up in China. I think they're very good opportunistically. They're executing. And the other side of this equation that was in The New York Times article, which I absolutely I hope FDA officials listen to this. We need to reform our ability to get into the clinic fast. I can't tell you how many companies we are looking at— definitely going to phase one more. Increasingly, going to phase two outside of the US, because the FDA is the most inflexible in getting drugs into the clinic quickly and efficiently. And that's where China has been eating our lunch. And if we can change that, I think you may see a different scenario play out, right? And seeing more clinical trials in the US and maybe pulling back some of that balance. So I just, I think there's a lot of dynamics at play here, other than.\n\n00:26:10,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, no, we can't restrict innovation. These are structural issues that are affecting our sector, that I think we need to take seriously.\n\n00:26:19,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n And of course, it's not just a U. S. issue. I mean, look at the news that's happened in the UK over the past two days. Merck just canceled their mega R&D facility in London, and a month ago, GSK just signed that huge R&D partnership uh with Hangrui. So, right there, literally thousands of R&D jobs in the UK that are like tangibly do not exist today that would have existed.\n\n00:26:47,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n You like making me cry, don't you, Brad?\n\n00:26:50,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Exactly.\n\n00:26:53,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right. Well, look, this is a story that's going to continue to play out. We have to watch this executive order. plays out but I think it's a very nuanced and uh, you know, different opinions on both sides. All right, let's there's a lot of data this week as well. So let's move to kind of the data side of the ledger. Tess, do you want to cover Revolution?\n\n00:27:11,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know what they announced this week?\n\n00:27:13,930 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, absolutely. So Revolution Medicines came out with data on their pan-RAS inhibitor in first-line PDAC. Pancreatic. And they posted a really impressive overall response rate of 55 percent. Which is quite remarkable in a very challenging setting. And I think the comp that everyone was looking at was really um, full furinox or Natalie Fox, which have response rates that are kind of in the. You know, in the high 30s for Fall Firinox and low 40s for Nellie or Fox. Both of those regimens have pretty significant safety tolerability. Uh, challenges and so you know, what Revolution Medicines is talking about going into phase three with.\n\n00:28:14,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n Is GenNav, which has a a lower response rate. But is something that is still in pretty broad use simply because of the you know, tolerability associated with some of the, sorry, this is, this is GMP. That they're talking about for phase three. Um, and you know, I think this is um, you know, this is just an exciting area, great to see, you know, great to see. Um, you know, some real progress in a very difficult, you know, historically very difficult to treat. Cancer. So we'll hopefully be getting more data soon. Uh, you know, still waiting on um, you know, PFS still waiting on duration of response. But certainly, you know. Really, really impressive to see. Such a strong response rate posted.\n\n00:29:10,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, and I'll just highlight: the first line is always risky and challenging, but if you win, right. You win big. And so it's always nice to see companies taking chances on first line data. I think Genentech did that very well in creating the whole kind of cancer landscape. So yeah, that was really impressive to see. Brad, the narcolepsy market is competitive, and there's been data releases on. uh from a couple competitors you want to cover.","char_start":23784,"char_end":28114,"start_time":"00:25:09","end_time":null}

Brad, the narcolepsy market is competitive, and there's been data releases on. uh from a couple competitors you want to cover.\n\n00:29:39,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, so I actually just a moment ago came back from Takeda where I interviewed Christoph Weber. That interview will be up in about a half an hour. And this is really cool science. I mean, this is a story that more people should know about because it really illustrates the best of our industry. So narcolepsy, which I think everyone knows, is a condition where you can't really stay awake during the day, and there's also a muscular element to it. Um, It was discovered around the year 2000 that it's caused by something called orexin. So that's a neuropeptide. And people who have this condition have damage to their neurons and don't make that. And so that's what causes this condition. And so it's one of these diseases where, up until this point, people have really only been able to try to help with the symptoms and not the underlying condition.\n\n00:30:38,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n The two people that discovered that were one Japanese scientist, and he started working with Takeda. Twenty-five years ago. And so, and together they created an orexin orexin agonist. They've actually tried once with one of these and failed.\n\n00:31:01,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n They developed another one that was a little more specific to something called the orexin-2 inhibitor. And they just announced successfully at a big conference called World Sleep Congress earlier this week, two successful phase three trials.\n\n00:31:20,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n The gist of it is that, essentially, like the the the patients who were on the drug, like 80% essentially were delivered to like uh essentially a normal lifestyle and and and weren't struggling with this like uh, you know, they they they would so it's uh really huge achievement of science that you know took a long time it took many years to figure out why what was the cause of this and it took 25 years to figure out how to drug it but It seems they've been able to do that. And. From like a stock market and like biotech competitive standpoint, everyone's also talking and comparing and contrasting them. with Alkermes. So Alkermes is farther behind. They presented phase two data. at the same conference. And the big difference is cicadas is a twice a day and alchermes is a once a day. And so. Alchemy still has to run and succeed in a phase three trial, but that I think is going to be the big debate of whether the first to market.\n\n00:32:27,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, is going to be the winning factor here, or if, you know, depending ultimately on what the Alchemy's phase three profile is, if, uh, if a once-a-day would, would make a big difference competitively, but bottom line is.\n\n00:32:43,149 [SPEAKER_4]\n Intractable disease literally up until a week ago, and Takeda seems to have a really good drug here. Another thing that I think is cool about it is everything about it was developed at Takeda. From the start, so you know, we often as Chris was just talking about with China, we often criticize pharma companies for outsourcing their science. Well, this is a good example where, over decades, the science was right there in this big pharmaceutical company, and they've ultimately succeeded.\n\n00:33:17,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's great. Brett, how big do these drugs appear to be peak sales?\n\n00:33:22,990 [SPEAKER_4]\n So it's technically a rare disease, but in the U. S., it's like 150,000. So it's like a more common rare disease, for lack of a better term. And the numbers that I've seen are like between 1. 5 and 3 billion. Um and it's a big needle move. I've interviewed Christoph in the past before this succeeded, and uh whenever we went over as the pipeline, he always highlighted this is essentially the most important thing they were working on. So it's a big deal even for a big company like that.\n\n00:33:59,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right. Well, we touched on a revolution. And Eric, I realize now that you may have some comments on that, but we had the World Lung Conference.\n\n00:34:08,509 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, conference this week and there's some other particularly in summit, but uh, Eric, you want to comment anything more on on revolution and then we can uh move to summit.","char_start":27814,"char_end":32252,"start_time":"00:29:39","end_time":null}

Revolution Medicines is just real simple. As Tess describes, they've got a wonderful drug. It's been 30 years of almost nothing working in pancreatic cancer. And yes, they're taking on some risk and going in front line, but these drugs, if there's flat out work. So I have. Every bit of confidence in the world that they will read out very positively. And the other wonderful thing about pancreatic cancer is we have a whole new set of mechanisms.\n\n00:34:47,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n PRMT5 inhibitors, Bristol, Amgen, and Tango are leading that charge. And they also look like they're going to work much better than anything we've ever seen in this indication. So finally, some hope for patients. I'll turn it over to Sam, because I know that he was actually sacrificing his weekend last weekend to attend World Lung, and he can start there.\n\n00:35:08,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, sorry, the sacrificing in Barcelona is a very easy thing to do. As you all know, I'm sure. And look, the conference, I love this conference or any of these ones. I'm going to International Myeloma next week in Toronto, because you get completely focused on one tumor. You don't end up having to tear yourself apart like at ASCA or ESMO, which of course are also must-attend conferences. So the sorts of things that we saw there obviously were summit data. But I think we'll talk about that last. And I know Eric's got some thoughts there too.\n\n00:35:45,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n is a conference where we saw quite a lot of new early-stage, sometimes updated data, sometimes new trials for small-cell lung cancer. It is an area I was particularly focused on. Of course, there's ADCs being developed against B7H3 and DLL3.\n\n00:36:06,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n XABV showcased the first-time data for that in second-line small cell-line cancer. All these drugs, and of course, Daiichi Sankyo updated their with Merck, a second line, relatively large 137 patient data set with if you're not a map directs to can, which is the B7H3 again, ADC. So that was one of the larger early stage data sets that came out.\n\n00:36:35,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n And you see similar ranges of DFS. Of course, you've got chemo here, which it helps. So it's in line with what you get with topazide.\n\n00:36:46,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n carboplatin, which is the standard of care, maybe a little bit better. But in the end, you've got more side effects associated still with them that are important. And of course, the challenge for all of these is that you've got Amgen's bispecific.\n\n00:37:02,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n To compete with, where you've got an immune angle to the therapy that you're dealing with. Whereas with ADCs, perhaps the hope is that you get some immune reaction because of the focused, uh, toxicity within the tumor, but with Amgen, and they updated some of the data. Um, at the conference you see some really really strong efficacy, particularly some of the um, phase one two data from in first line small cell logs. So a lot of these drugs need to think about where they fit when tarlatumab, which is in Deltra from Amgen, which is a DLL3 CD3 bite, moves into first line. Where do they fit? None of them really had data that showed how well they performed in patients. post-Indeltera therapy, because I think a lot of these trials have been going on at a time when, of course, you don't have Indeltera being used in first-line, or even at second-line.","char_start":31952,"char_end":35703,"start_time":"00:34:08","end_time":null}

So the jury, in my mind, is still out where these ADCs are going. And there's a whole bunch of them, right? Henry Idea has got one, which looks, I have to say, really PFS of 6. 7, which is one of the strongest ones I've seen. AbbVie's looked that strong too. um So we have to wait and see how these go. And then, of course, in the first line, we had some data from updates from Delphi 303, which is Amgen's trial of adding Imdeltra 2. The standard of care, which is either druvalumab or tezolizumab. And, you know, in the Atezzo one, we had a readout that was 25. 3 months OS, 48 patients. Well, that's a pretty hefty OS signal. So they're doing phase three trials with it, particularly with AstraZeneca's.\n\n00:38:59,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n And then, lastly, we did see updates from BioNTech. In this setting, first line and they had a trial where they took some patients outside of China. It wasn't What Summit did, which is an extension of a Chinese study. They just recruited a bunch of different patients outside of China with a slightly lower dose of their BNT327, which is PD-L1 VEGF bispecific. Which of course is a presage to SUMMIT, which was in non-small cell lung cancer. But here in small cell lung cancer, this seems, again, some nice. First line efficacy as a single agent, which is sorry single agent with ethoposide and carboplatin. And you're seeing some decent ORR rates, really, really decent data, but really early readout. I mean, we had a six and a half months median follow up. So there's a lot more to go there.\n\n00:39:53,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n But I'm going to keep my eye on that. I'm more of a fan of a PD-L1 approach for these VEGF bispecifics than PD-1. Let's see if they work out. Um, maybe pass on to Eric to talk about Summit and I can chip in a little bit after.\n\n00:40:08,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I guess the big news from Summit and many of our listeners have probably seen the stock was quite weak on Monday, down about 25% or so. And that's a big move. This is a $20 billion company. So 25% down, it's lost $5 billion of value. I get that this stock moves in big increments and is very volatile and heavily insider owned. I'm not so sure the markets have it right in this case. What we were looking for from the Harmony study, and this is a small market opportunity for Ebon Escamab, it's second line EGFR positive lung cancer. Uh, really, too small of a market to move the needle for the company, but what we wanted to see was geographic consistency. It's the first study in which non-Asian patients were enrolled. So we have some Western patients and U. S. patients and North American patients. And honestly, there were a lot of different lenses through which you could have looked at these data sets. You could look at PFS, you could look at OS, you could look at benchmark data, you can look at hazard ratios, etc. And again, you can look across all those geographies.\n\n00:41:08,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n To my eye, at least, I thought there was more consistency than inconsistency. Obviously, the market voted with its.\n\n00:41:16,870 [SPEAKER_2]\n with its [power] and came to a different conclusion. Sam, one thing you're going to have to explain to me is this fascination of the media with whether or not they can file on these data in the US. I honestly think it's completely off the mark. I think if Summit had to choose, they'd choose not to file because filing only starts the IRA clock. A year or two in advance and shortens their window. Of exclusivity and would probably be net present value destroying, in my opinion. So I don't think the company has any interest in filing. Still many of the media articles out there are about, wow, they can't file because they just missed on their primary endpoint of survival. But I'll shut up, Sam, and let you.\n\n00:41:59,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, Eric, wasn't that the message that they may have put out there sometimes in talking to some people with regards to this potentially being registrational?\n\n00:42:09,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Certainly, they thought it could be, yes.","char_start":35403,"char_end":39817,"start_time":"00:38:04","end_time":null}

So I think they're not and they're not sure yet. Yeah. No, of course not. You have to wait and see. I mean, they've got a very serious chief medical officer in charge there, Jack West, who I think he's been one of the big advocates of you need overall support. Signals for anything to be approved. But so, I think the issue with it is that if you look at the data, you go, 'This is premature.' So, I mean, if you look at the forest flot for Western patients and you subtract the US patients out— which you can do— you end up with a zero, i. e., a zero benefit in Europe. Why? Because the follow-up is very short. So they show this data in a press release that goes, 'We have a 0. 7 hazard ratio on a very small number' or you have to switch those patients around and you get a completely different hazard ratio. And I think, I don't know whether they were pushed to do it. Is it the need for raising money? I don't know what the story here is, but I went around the conference.\n\n00:43:15,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n I could grab, ask them, 'What do you think?' Well, I'm not so sure now that I've seen this data. And of course, the discussant really didn't do them any favors. He literally said that he thinks pretty much most of the efficacy is coming from VEGF. Not PD1. And you go, 'Wow, that's a big statement.' A lot of people thought that was too harsh. But if you ask them, 'Do you want this drug on the market?' Well, yeah. So remember, these conferences are for physicians, not Wall Street, right? So I think it might have been a little bit of our own goal. It would have been better just to wait. Six months, 12 months, get that solid data. Get their nice follow-up and tell us what the answer is. Which we'll get there, of course.\n\n00:43:58,030 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hey, Brad, I'm curious about your, I remember when you did the breaking news interview with Bob Dugan. A year ago, when the early, initial data and Haven't heard you comment on this kind of roller coaster that Summit's been on. Any thoughts?\n\n00:44:11,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to look at World Lung closely, so I probably shouldn't comment.\n\n00:44:18,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah. All right. Hey, Eric, there was other news.\n\n00:44:22,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh data news. Uh, do you want to cover the myasthenia gravis?\n\n00:44:26,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, we can be quick here, Chris. I mean, I think what's interesting here is just that there's a new mechanism in town. This is from Dianthus. They had phase two data on a C1S inhibitor. Existing therapies for MG or FCRNs and C5 inhibitors. So we've got another compound that's shown pretty good data.\n\n00:44:47,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n Reacted well. I think you already mentioned that they raised some capital. And this will be fighting for share and probably what is becoming a very large, perhaps even $10 billion or so market. So I'm not sure I've got much else to add other than that.\n\n00:45:02,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right. Well, we'll move to kind of regulatory safety updates. So there's been quite a few this week. And maybe we'll do a few of them rapid fire. Intercept, which has had its own roller coaster, you know, this was the product that got approved for primary biliary collagenitis and got accelerated approval. It was rejected for full approval. This was a company that was public and then acquired by Oh, Alpha Science, I think, the Italian company. And basically, they just had news this week that they pulled the drug from the market.","char_start":39517,"char_end":43328,"start_time":"00:41:59","end_time":null}

And so, again, just an update on that. Also, on the gene therapy side of things, we just continue to wait for other shoes to drop. And this was capsida, which, you know, had kind of engineered novel capsids to develop gene therapies. Their lead program, which is for genetic pediatric epilepsy, the first patient that was dosed died within a few weeks, days, I believe. And so they've basically put that trial on hold. That's always tough when you're dealing with a pediatric and you have a death in the first patient that's dosed. But I think, you know, any time we think that there might be a removal of some of the headwinds around gene therapy, it seems. We still aren't out of the woods on some of the safety risks and concerns that we see in that space.\n\n00:46:47,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, Eric, you know, speaking of just safety, Selena was in the news as well. Uh, with the fares released, you wanna— you wanna talk about that?\n\n00:46:56,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, this is a broader issue. Maybe we should we should all chime in on this on this. Note, because as you know, and I think it was covered maybe last week on the show, FAERS is going to much more frequent data releases. It used to be once a quarter, and now the FDA is saying that they're going to release adverse events from this database on an almost daily basis. The latest company to get caught up in that disclosure was Celeno. We had to deal with, just last month, something on Agios and their drug for thalassemia in sickle cell patients. We're now seeing these fires erupt when FAIR's results suggest that patients on these drugs are being harmed. Of course, correlation is not causation. That's not something that Maha always understands. And this, to me, is a very much Maha-driven moment to try and showcase all the potential pitfalls of drug therapy. And the problem here is that it's not just bad for investors. It doesn't just cause volatility in Solano shares.\n\n00:47:57,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, Solano was down. 25% on an event that does not seem to be drug-related specifically. The company has called out the fact that the clinical investigator does not deem this to have been an adverse event attributable to the drug, and FAERS is not an accurate enough database to to come up with that potential causality link. So it's not just bad for investors, it's bad for patients. It causes commotion, it causes concern, it causes distress. And maybe it even prevents patients from getting access to good medicine. My view at least is this is not the right thing that we should be doing, but I'd really love to hear what others think.\n\n00:48:34,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Eric, I just want to question: isn't this one of those companies that was subject to a short report? And somebody tried to raise this issue independently. And then the company was trying to. or at least analysts were trying to refute that. Is that correct?\n\n00:48:48,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very much so. They're under attack by a hedge fund, Chris, and that is adding to the volatility. But again, I think this issue goes maybe beyond volatility in our world, too, unfortunately.\n\n00:49:00,140 [SPEAKER_2]\n impacting patient lives.\n\n00:49:02,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n Any other comments on this?\n\n00:49:07,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n Alright.\n\n00:49:09,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would just add that you can see better signals when you have more N and a larger sample size. Which, and I agree with what Eric says, which especially when a drug first launches.\n\n00:49:24,479 [SPEAKER_3]\n Certainly, there are types of events where, maybe, it is worthwhile to have those be broadly.","char_start":43028,"char_end":47052,"start_time":"00:45:39","end_time":null}

And truly, what is drug-related or not. Um, so I do think that, you know, there's, there's typically just a lot more context and putting these in, uh, you know, with a release that's maybe a bit. you know, a bit richer and larger sample size. the other thing i'd say that's just i think is an interesting kind of contrast right so we have On the one hand, this like. hey there's more transparency there's more um you know real-time uh ae reports more um background on CRLs, particularly for drugs that were never approved. But at the same time, we're seeing a lot of adcoms get canceled, right? uh you know we saw an uh an adcom get cancelled for the biohaven drug we saw an adcom get cancelled for you know, Travere's drug, Filfari.\n\n00:50:40,060 [SPEAKER_3]\n for FSGS. And so that's kind of the other side here, right, which is that is, you know, a type of transparency that I think. was really valuable for drug developers.\n\n00:50:52,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n Also a great opportunity for patients and physicians to really have a voice around patient care. And we're. seeing fewer of those.\n\n00:51:02,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I think this kind of question about, like, you know, transparency and, like, what is transparency good for? I think transparency is good when it helps you better understand what to do. With a certain piece of information.\n\n00:51:17,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I do think the CRLs are harmful, and I do think adcoms are really helpful, and I hope we get back to a world where those are more normal.\n\n00:51:25,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, well, on that point, so Capricor, which was in the news a lot this year. Because there was an adcom that was canceled, but then a CRL was issued. There was some debate. You know, why the adcom was canceled. It was— it was scheduled and then canceled. You know, so when the CRL was released by the FDA, Capricorn put out a statement saying they were not. They were aware of the CRL, obviously, but they were not aware that the FDA was going to post it. And so they came back and said, 'Hey, we had a response to the CRL and you didn't post that. So we're going to communicate what our response was, which— is pretty common, right? I mean, when there's FDA communications to a company, the company's going to respond and say, 'Hey, we think you got this wrong,' or 'Hey, we want to have a further discussion about.' X, Y, or Z, and you continue that dialogue. Obviously, the FDA doesn't have the right to post company communications, but it does raise the issue of how do these get adjudicated in the public domain if the FDA's just sharing their view.\n\n00:52:29,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n Then it's going to invite more company communication, which most companies don't like to air out their disagreements with the FDA. You know, in public. Um, but it looks like we're gonna kind of have to see more of that if you know, the FDA is going to be especially without notice for the company and to negotiate, you know, how that communication would would play out. So. Yeah, this definitely kind of cuts both ways. Any other comments about this whole transparency and safety? Adcoms write communications.\n\n00:53:02,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would just add— I think you said it very well, Chris— that like.\n\n00:53:07,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n There's an argument to be made for more transparency and publishing CRLs as soon as possible. But what you're seeing in this kind of first example of that is how it could get out of hand quickly. And it's like. Every communication between the company and the FDA turns into a public press release— like, 'Is that really? Healthy.' Exactly. Yeah.","char_start":46752,"char_end":50941,"start_time":"00:49:24","end_time":null}

Yeah.\n\n00:53:35,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I'll just say, I mean, look, partly from this experience, but, you know, adcoms can be politicized as well. And how they craft the questions and the briefing documents. And so I definitely am in the camp of adcoms can be good if they are used appropriately. And objectively, right, to have a good discussion, debate among independent advisors. So, you know, it'll be interesting to see where the FDA stance of. It might be that they feel that the adcom process needs some reengineering and that they come back out. But I think time will tell what that ends up looking like.\n\n00:54:14,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll just add, also, there's the SEC action. Part of this is keeping biotech companies honest. And there was some chatter on Twitter saying, 'Hey, it was a good thing that the SEC took action on a former FibroGen chief medical officer who manipulated data. The company had communicated that data. To investors, they had to come out and recant. That it was manipulated data. And again, I only highlight this because we need these types of actions to keep. All of the biotech companies honest and try to dissuade and discourage any of that type of misrepresentation of data or manipulation of data, obviously, is more and more egregious.'\n\n00:54:54,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sam, I want to ask you, Bridge Bio, this is not really a regulatory issue, but they are— Bloomberg, and I know this is not your group that writes up on the industry, but they accused Al Nilem, Pfizer of not playing fair. In the ATTR cardiomyopathy market. Do you have any insight on that?\n\n00:55:15,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I mean, Chris, this is not— it's my colleague Anne Hunter who covers Alnylam at least. So, I mean, she has a view that the The stabilizers are not going to be able to stand up to Al-Naylam's approach in the long run. And she has a view that it's going to. Be tough. I know Josh is a particular um, has been a fan of Bridge Buyer's Drug, and I'm not. I don't have a position in this. But the Pfizer's uh drugs going off patent in uh 2020. I mean, when you look at the the um uh the consensus numbers vindical kind of disappears or peaks in 2027 and then starts crashing from 28 onwards. So of course, I mean, are we surprised that Pfizer is fighting tooth and nail to protect and grow this drug because they need things that are growing? On the other hand, are the allegations correct? I mean, some of the things that were in that article were kind of.\n\n00:56:19,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n Pfizer essentially said that it was an error. So Pfizer said that a video that they had that showed that said that their drug was.\n\n00:56:27,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n The only approved drug in this class was a video that was played in error at a conference or something. But Bridgewire is saying that they're using this kind of tactics all the time. And look, I don't know what's right or wrong here, or what's fact or not fact. I'm not saying anybody is lying, but I wouldn't be surprised if a company under pressure trying to maintain a revenue line does use all the methods that it's got to try and maintain that. Does it mean that they would cross the line? I'm assuming not. But it's a cutthroat business, as you know. These two drugs do the same kind of approach. But as you said, I didn't write this thing, so I don't know what the details are exactly. I don't think I. I. I don't know anybody else has commented that.\n\n00:57:20,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Read the article I did not read it. Brad. I know you've interviewed a lot of the players in this space and clarified some of that, but any other comments on the bridge bio?\n\n00:57:30,259 [SPEAKER_4]\n No, not really.

With Harvey Berger, who took over as CEO of Arena Bioworks, which had a lot of money put in, which was looking at an alternative kind of private approach to discovery from the you know, big institutions, you know, Whitehead, Koch Institute, right? You know, the Broad and really trying to, you know, get discovery researchers to develop and again, going back to the innovation curve. So Harvey. Uh, kind of went to work with his old collaborator, Store Treiber, to take the CEO role of Arena. Brad, in that interview, any insights that you uncovered that you wanted to highlight on that move?\n\n00:58:19,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, I really like Harvey. I've gotten to know him pretty well. I would put him under the category of people that could be sitting on a beach right now. I mean, he doesn't have to do this and his. Excitement about it is like palpable and genuine, so I give it credibility and credence. You know, for that reason alone, I will say that. They've disclosed essentially nothing about what they're working on and so it's hard to. It's hard to really say anything about the Yeah. Any of that because they. They— Yeah, they're. Modality, agnostic, you know, so they haven't really said anything to gauge.\n\n00:59:03,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're not too surprising because of early discovery, they don't want to tip their hand too much and have a bunch of fast followers if they are working on stuff that's truly innovative.\n\n00:59:13,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n We're close to wrapping here, but Sam, do you want to just highlight the Novo layoffs? To close out this week.\n\n00:59:19,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, sure. I mean, this has been something that I think it was a shock because no one notices from the analysis that the search that I've done has never laid off people at this sort of scale. So 11% of it's of its workforce, 5 000 of that, 9 000 people in Denmark, they've called people to come back to work every day. And in the press release, they said that we're going to be in a more performance-led culture, which of course makes you wonder, what was it before? So look, the company said they want to spend money on R &D, right? And also changing, I can't remember the exact phrases here. I think dynamics in terms of selling their drug particularly. And I wonder whether this is signaling that this direct-to-consumer sales is not as straightforward as it seems. And I don't know how much that's signaling. But share prices reacted positively at least mostly.\n\n01:00:12,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think the company does need to catch up with Lilly, who currently has the better drugs.\n\n01:00:19,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n I tweeted something about this that.\n\n01:00:23,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n a lot of people reacted to that I thought was interesting is um You know, it's like the old saying, like history doesn't always repeat, but it rhymes or whatever that saying is.\n\n01:00:34,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n I feel like the GLPs are going through the exact same thing that the PD1s went through. For a while, remember Bristol?\n\n01:00:43,270 [SPEAKER_4]\n was the king of the hill.\n\n01:00:45,600 [SPEAKER_4]\n And in this in that case, they messed up how they developed it. And Merck was able. And Merck did a really great strategic job of developing Keytruda and eventually pulled ahead, looking at the sales difference between Keytruda.\n\n01:01:02,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n And in the next mega category, you've seen something a little similar, although I think it's less of a strategic error on Novo's part and more of just 'zep' bound seems seems to be a better drug. And so they're going to have to grapple with that. But I think it's interesting how the The company that was out in front ultimately got overtaken by somebody else.","char_start":54343,"char_end":58407,"start_time":"00:57:20","end_time":null}

How Lilly got here, I don't know whether it was fortuitous or what. The mechanism they used to combine GLP-1 with GIP, I don't think that was. It I don't think many people thought that was going to actually work the way it did. Soudos to them. They did it. But let's not forget, Novo has been innovating in this space for years.

I'm Daphne Zohar and my co-hosts today are Josh Shimmer, Luba Greenwood, and Matt Glein. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent so the biotech sector had a nice recovery since April's liberation day with XBI up over 40 percent. Our colleague Tim Obler at Steeple put out a Bullish report arguing biotech is poised to outperform.\n\n00:00:38,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n They calculate that the cumulative enterprise value of the entire public global biotech sector is up 89% since April's lows. And the case that Stifel makes for biotech outperforming cites a number of factors, including interest rates. We saw one cut earlier this week and more cuts are anticipated.\n\n00:00:59,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n M&A activity is accelerating, and this was one of the major points that they made: that major pharma companies are holding $1. 2 trillion in acquisition firepower. As they face $180 billion in revenue at risk from patent cliffs, meaning blockbuster drugs that lose their patent status. By 2030.\n\n00:01:19,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n And one interesting point they made is that the annualized M&A is tracking to be around 186 billion, making it the strongest year since 2019.\n\n00:01:29,369 [SPEAKER_2]\n Despite the lack of mega deals.\n\n00:01:32,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n And we've heard a lot about the biotech winter. In fact, there was an article in the Boston Globe this week. I've heard a lot about that over the past few years with companies and programs shutting down and layoffs across the sector. But Stiefel points out that the upside of this is that there's been a healthy cleansing process, eliminating weak companies. And leaving. 82% is what they estimate of public U. S. biotech value concentrated in firms with strong data sets. They have a really nice analysis, what they look at. The strength of the data set of different companies. And then, the number of publicly traded biotechs has dropped over 20% in the past 40 months. Through different things happening, including bankruptcies and acquisitions, while billion-dollar companies have expanded significantly. So again, this makes the argument that there's a healthier distribution. With fewer negative enterprise value firms. Of course, there's still a number of headwinds, including continued policy uncertainty, which we're going to touch on. But many positives as well. Josh, I want to start with you.\n\n00:02:32,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I'm curious to see if you're seeing an improvement in investor sentiment and, just, overall, what you're seeing out there.\n\n00:02:39,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, things are looking up. We run our own analysis, actually, looking at the individual components on a weighted basis of the XBI, the index that's gone. Pretty much nowhere for the last 10 or so years and suggest that biotech is fairly uninvestable for generalist investors, as we've talked about plenty of times. On this show. But what's really interesting is if you break down the XBI by its individual components and kind of play each one out using consensus estimates. The XBI itself looks like it's going from basically an index that's never ever on an aggregate on a weighted basis been anywhere close to profitable. It's actually now, because of some of the dynamics that you just pointed out and that Tim had pointed out. It's maturing in a really interesting way, it's now just on the cusp of profitability with meaningful inflection over the next two to three years in that profitability.\n\n00:03:39,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um again, driven by maturation of the industry, companies that are having really Uh, Uh, excellent product launches.

Um culling of the herd to some extent, so that you know, the XBI includes about 120 companies.\n\n00:03:58,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, and so we're kind of reinvigorating it with high quality, profitable companies. And within a couple of years, you could envision the valuation of the sector in total being quite appealing to generalist investors, again, for the first time ever, because why would anyone ever want to invest in an unprofitable sector? A sector that, by the way, was unprofitable for for decades. So that's actually changing in front of our eyes. I think many are kind of getting that sense that something is really different. About the industry in a very fundamental type way. It helps that the IPO window has been closed for so long that we haven't added more speculative type names to the ecosystem. And as the IPO window opens, I think we're going to have plenty of high-quality private companies. Um, move through that window to join their publicly traded peers and again in a much healthier way than in the past.\n\n00:05:01,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n So, you know, I'm also rather bullish on the sector in general as a result, obviously, with the all the headwinds that we all know about that we're going to have to address. I think we probably have a little different views on M &A. It's been a high-volume year for M &A, at least for publicly traded biotech companies. We tend to focus on those more so than the private transactions. Deal value, aggregate deal value is still pretty light because we're still still a lot of cleanup M &A that's happening. And that's that's totally OK. But I think we look for forces other than M &A to really drive the sector in total because it is really hard to move the needle. Using that, but it's a lot easier to move the needle when you actually create sound fundamental business models that make the sector profitable and attractive for a larger audience.\n\n00:05:54,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's a really interesting point. And I think if I look back a few years ago, we were on this same program talking about the fact that the business model in biotech is broken or was broken. The idea that it relied so heavily on M &A, I think, was a major problem. But seeing biotechs kind of grow up and be able to launch drugs successfully is really something. I think, very positive for the sector. So let's go to Matt, just get your general comments, and then Luba will talk about a couple of the M &A transactions we saw. Well, I guess one M &A and one licensing deal.\n\n00:06:30,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thanks.\n\n00:06:31,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n Look, I think I am, sorry, can you hear me okay? I'm just making sure. Yep. Great. I feel like I'm sort of halfway between host and guest today. Because this week I've kind of had my head in the sand. We put out some good data. But what I was going to say is it's hard to feel bad a week that you've put out good data. And so I'm all optimism.\n\n00:06:50,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n I actually agree with a ton of what Josh just said. And in particular, I have long thought the M&A focus of the biotech investment community is like bad long term for the sector. Just because it encourages like crowding and it encourages sort of group think and and everyone's sort of playing the shell game of trying to figure out what other people are thinking instead of trying to figure out like what's going to work as a business. And I think that I found really exciting about the last 24 months. has been the emergence of, and some of them have been acquired, but companies like Madrigal and Verona. And others. That, and, and, and our genetics that have like launched products successfully.\n\n00:07:34,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that are now like turning biotech from a.\n\n00:07:37,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n whatever, from unprofitable, as Josh described, to like a sort of more heterogeneity of business model more people actually trying to do what everybody in every industry has to do, which is to build a business around their thing. And it's fun to be a part of that and it's fun to watch it happen. And sort of seeing it work successfully across repeat examples is probably what is the biggest source of my optimism.","char_start":3583,"char_end":7946,"start_time":"00:03:39","end_time":null}

So thanks for joining us on what we know is a busy week for you.\n\n00:08:07,410 [SPEAKER_4]\n Can I just kind of comment on what Matt just said? Matt, congrats as well on those results. But I always get the most side-eyed look when I suggest that M&A and biotech is anything but an amazing thing for the sector. To your point, what we wind up doing is we're depleting those companies that could drive profitability, that could be bellwether components of the XBI, that could make the industry appealing. For even the generalist investors. And so we cheer these short-term victories, but it's hard not to see how they come at the expense of the of the sector overall, because it's taken a lot longer than it should have for the XBI to be a profitable type index. This is in a comment. on the XBI and the direction it's headed in because it's its own separate security, but you know, the sector needs profitability.\n\n00:08:59,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n in in in reasonable amounts to draw the generalists and without that dynamic, we're just kind of trading amongst ourselves the same frustration wondering what it's going to take for the sector to really start to inflect. We keep hoping M &A is going to do the trick, but in many ways, we're hoping for the wrong thing. That is because it is that M&A that sits on the sector and prevents it from being more profitable, more business-minded, and focused in general. So, Matt, I'm so glad you said it. Because anytime I bring up something that is even remotely critical of M&A, like investors get or shock that I could ever suggest something like that. But I think you're spot on. It's a short-term win for a long-term questionable productivity.\n\n00:09:46,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's also just boring at some like, whatever— not everybody on this call likes lives only as an investor in biotech, but like, in the industry, if the only thing that is considered like 'i think m a' is great for the right situations. And we've sold things and we buy things all the time. But if the only way to win is to get bought. It's just like boring. It's not that interesting. You don't get to like build fun businesses. You don't get to think about creative ways to create value. That falls outside of like the narrow package it up and sell it to a big pharma company kind of outcomes. I think a sector with more heterogeneity, with more different business models, with more creativity. It's just like a more fun sector to be a part of.\n\n00:10:24,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Okay. Let's go to Luba. Luba, first, any thoughts generally on what's been happening in the sector? And then I'd love to hear you cover the rules this week.\n\n00:10:34,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. So I completely agree with M &A comments, although I do have to say we do have a few sectors in healthcare that have very limited M &A options, and that's medical device and diagnostics, and none of us want to be in that sector. It's not all that fun. But I do agree with fundamentally the issues with M &A. Um, and I agree, I'm highly bullish on the sector. What's happening right now, we're fundraising. It's a great time to do that, especially if you're a clinical stage company. I think there's been a lot of cleanup in the public markets, as everyone has just mentioned. And then, just one more thing to add, we're already seeing some generalists coming in, and we're also seeing some new funds that are on the public sector coming in as well.","char_start":7646,"char_end":11469,"start_time":"00:08:00","end_time":null}

Now, to cover a few deals, speaking of M&A, first, I'll start with what we saw this week. Roche is acquiring a company called 89Bio. It's a transaction that's worth up to $3. 5 billion. It is in the metabolic and cardiometabolic and liver disease space. Shows, again, how hot the space is. Just digging in into the deal. Details of it, Roche is actually paying about $2. 4 billion upfront for 14. 5 per share in cash. On top of that, shareholders have a way to earn out additional money up to that 3. 5 billion with additional milestones. So they set three milestones and they're all commercially based ones. Uh, one is to receive to get to commercial launch— uh in cirrhotic mash by 2030, the other one is to get over 3 billion in global sales, and the last is getting over 4 billion in global sales.\n\n00:12:28,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n So what does that tell you? Number one, it shows that Roche sees some blockbuster potential value in this and specifically in FGF21 therapies. The way they structured it is pretty classical milestone-based deal structure that Roche has done before. I was at Roche and M&A previously to that. We like these structures. It limits the upfront risk. But you can get quite a bit on the upside, especially if you do see this as blockbuster potential.\n\n00:12:59,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um and why does this matter and why are people excited about this? Um so the drug, that's um currently called pegose firmin, um it is in late stage development, um from mash, um and we've already seen as um I believe Jeff just mentioned there's been risdifra that was approved which is madrigal drug, but it was approved for non-cirrhotic mash, so cirrhosis still remains a pretty major unmet medical need. So if you're looking into FGF21 analogs like the 89-bios drug, also if you're looking at Ikeros EFX drug, They are showing pretty encouraging data suggesting that there is fibrosis regression and even benefit.\n\n00:13:48,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n And cirrhotic. So there's quite a bit of upside on top of the drug that's on the market today. So this is where Roche is playing really into this field. Um and if you're taking a step back and looking into kind of why Roche is doing this. I mean, they have had a very big push into metabolism very recently and cardiometabolic pathways. They acquire Karmot Therapeutics. They just did a deal, a pretty large deal with Zeeland Pharma that was in obesity. So they want to play in the broader cardiorenal metabolic space. And they also think that you can combine FGF21 and GLP-1 to increase efficacy beyond obesity and fatty liver and beyond.\n\n00:14:42,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n Good news. If you are an investor listening, if you're an operator, this validates FGF21 biology. It shows a signal that Big Pharma is still trying to consolidate all their metabolic assets. They're still playing in this field. It's still hot. It's still big. Thank you. And Roche in particular is betting a mash to move beyond early fibrosis into advanced disease. And they think that you can get multi-billion dollar sales with this. The only risk here, of course, is the phase three readout is not expected until 2027. So execution risk is still high, but it's good for the future of MASH and metabolic disease.\n\n00:15:24,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. And you pointed out the CVR. It's interesting that it's a tool that pharma companies like to use, but it doesn't sound like the market's attributing a ton of value to the CVR and the likelihood of achieving it. Based on the current value.\n\n00:15:41,999 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, that's sort of an interesting point, I guess. The milestones seem like they may be. Are a little more challenging as they were laid out. Yeah. I agree.\n\n00:15:53,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, let's go on to the Novartis licensing of Monte Rosa's programs.","char_start":11169,"char_end":15350,"start_time":"00:11:23","end_time":null}

The milestones seem like they may be. Are a little more challenging as they were laid out. Yeah. I agree.\n\n00:15:53,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay, let's go on to the Novartis licensing of Monte Rosa's programs.\n\n00:16:00,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I love this because, you know, people talked last year, last few years about INI, immunology, preclinical work, AI. And, you know, we're always worried when we start hyping up certain areas such as INI and AI drug discovery. That there's nothing to it. So for those people that are in this space and are excited about this space, this deal is actually great.\n\n00:16:28,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's a further validation that AI drug discovery is meaningful. Having platform technologies is meaningful. And there's still quite a lot of interest in preclinical to early clinical. Immunology assets. So just to give you a background, Novartis just struck a licensing deal with value to about $5. 27 billion. Of course, this is the total value that one could get. And it shows quite still a lot of interest in next-generation small molecule degraders for in the immune-mediated space. Now, again, they don't get all $5. 7 billion up front. Montarosa gets $120 million, which is still pretty good. And Novartis in return gets exclusive license for undisclosed target that is currently in discovery. And this target was used, was developed by using Monterosa's AI and machine learning-powered.\n\n00:17:33,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Platform, which is a molecular glue degrader platform that they have called Queen. And Novartis, in addition to this one, has an option to license two additional programs from Monterosa in their preclinical immunology pipeline. So if it all goes well, you know, with option and maintenance fees and commercial milestones, if you add all of that up, Monterrosa could receive about $5. 7 billion. But right now it's getting $120 million up front. This is not the first deal. So this is actually, Novartis has doubled down on these deals with Monterosa last year. They licensed. Another molecular glue degrader targeting VAP1, which is called MRT6160, that they've licensed for $150 million up front and then milestones that were over $2 billion. That program is already advancing in the clinic.\n\n00:18:34,270 [SPEAKER_0]\n So very exciting. So Novartis is looking to enter into this deal to get to the same place as they got to with the earlier deal. So some of the things— just for investors, operators, and others in the biotech— why this is exciting, important.\n\n00:18:50,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, if you're in protein degradation, molecular glue, the space farm is betting very heavily on that space.\n\n00:18:58,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n Especially Novartis, continues to do so. AI drug discovery is really paying off for many companies, especially if you can come up with novel drug targets and take them through discovery and early testing and into the clinic. Um, and upfront again, you know, this is, these are big numbers, but still upfront is kind of at the modest 120, 220, 250.\n\n00:19:23,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n for these types of deals. So for Novartis and other pharma, it means they can keep the risk low. and really look to Monterosa to deliver on discovery. And then once they do and hit their preclinical milestones. Then Novartis can step in and help with development and commercial, of course. So what's good for Monte Rosa? It gives it cash, of course, credibility, future investment and partnerships. They're exclusive on these particular molecules, but they're opened up to. to potential partnerships with others. And what's exciting for them, they can also extend to finance. They have multiple programs that they're interested in financing into phase two.\n\n00:20:09,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Thank you, Luba. Those are really helpful insights on those deals. So let's move on to data. Earlier this week, Atire Pharma announced that their phase three study of efsofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis did not meet its primary endpoint. Matt, I believe Roivant ran a phase two study in this indication that also didn't show benefit. Any thoughts on the ATAR study and learnings for others? Considering this indication.","char_start":15050,"char_end":19303,"start_time":"00:15:41","end_time":null}

Matt, I believe Roivant ran a phase two study in this indication that also didn't show benefit. Any thoughts on the ATAR study and learnings for others? Considering this indication.\n\n00:20:39,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, thanks. We had a failed study ourselves in an anti-GM-CSF antibody in sarcoidosis just about a year ago, a little bit less than a year ago. Look, I think, first of all, if you're not familiar with sarcoidosis, this is a tough disease. It's a tough disease, and that makes me glad that people have done work in it, including Atire. Uh, a couple hundred thousand patients, very sick. High morbidity, high mortality.\n\n00:21:03,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n And really no option. I mean, these patients are treated with. Sort of the normal range of immunosuppressants and steroids and things like that, but mostly no good treatment options. So, first of all, I'll say, failed study or not, I'm in good attire for giving it a go, and I think it's an area that desperately needs successful development. I think one of the interesting things about the Atire study that failed was the primary endpoint, which was a true steroid sparing endpoint, right? They were trying to show. uh, a delta in the steroid reduction of patients on drug versus off on a placebo-adjusted basis and they showed some. I think they were baby powered for a three milligram Delta or something like that, or that was their target. And they showed, I think, like a 0. 7 or 0. 8 milligram Delta relative to placebo. You know, I think it's interesting.\n\n00:21:47,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n And we see this across a whole bunch of diseases, especially in autoimmune disease. Where you know, there's sort of FDA-established endpoints that are often these composite scales that are subject to high placebo responses. And it's just very hard to find a good way to study disease progression. And then doctors really want to get patients off steroids. So I think it was like an interesting choice at endpoint. And I think Atire did some interesting things, including starting with a relatively high baseline level of steroid burden for the patient population, which probably made the study harder to enroll. To maximize their probability of succeeding here, they had to push hard. Disappointing, they didn't. I'd say the one most common piece of pushback I've heard on the study is I think, the drug mechanistically is a little bit unclear in terms of how it was going to work in the disease, but they had reasonable human clinical data going into this study. And so, you know, obviously a disappointing outcome. This definitely is one of these situations, maybe like Abivax even earlier this summer, where I think the general consensus view was this study had a real uphill battle and probably wasn't going to work. And so I heard it come up a lot from investors because it was the kind of thing where, if it had worked, I think it would have had a pronounced effect on the stock price. So disappointing. That didn't happen, disappointing outcome to the study, but interesting study design and interesting focus on steroids sparing as a clinical benefit.\n\n00:22:55,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. And one interesting point here is, as you point out, it was a closely followed study and there was a lot of discussion, sort of a battle of longs versus shorts. On the short side, there were a few very active accounts, particularly on X or Twitter. And one of them was Martin Shkreli, who posted in late July that he believed the study would fail and that the stock would be down 80%. pretty much hit it on the head and I know that short sellers are viewed as the bad guys by many, but I think Thoughtful short analysis can be helpful. Um, to longs, for example, and understanding the weaknesses of a data set, even if one is going to be long. And it may also be helpful to management, I think, in understanding parts of their story. That aren't resonating. I feel like he's a short seller, and the skeptics are sometimes maligned. Too much. I actually think that they have a very an important place in our ecosystem. I'm curious what you guys think about that.\n\n00:23:59,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would say.","char_start":19003,"char_end":23262,"start_time":"00:20:39","end_time":null}

On the other hand, we've seen some very aggressive, very visible short reports that actually cause confusion amongst patient and clinician groups. And that. You know, that's very unfortunate. A repercussion of these groups that lay out their short proposals. Oftentimes, you know, a mix of accurate information but also some misleading information. So it can be important and valuable for checks and balances in the industry, but on the other hand, when it starts to interfere with companies that are really trying to do best for patients and only causes confusion. We saw that recently with the company Agios. Where I think some various database cases were just kind of taken out of context without all the right information surrounding them to uh assuage not only investors, but more importantly, the patient and physician community.\n\n00:25:01,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n It can be dangerous.\n\n00:25:04,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and it's also dangerous for the shorts when they do that because they get killed afterwards.\n\n00:25:09,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n As an issuer, a healthy short thesis in your data as an issuer is to me just like almost entirely upside right like a healthy healthy short A healthy short. Volume drives rapid price discovery on good data, which is great. For the issuer and for the longs in those situations. And the other quote-unquote nice thing about shorts and biotech is: Look, as long as— As long as the company they're shorting doesn't need to raise money before the data. Ultimately, science will come and be the reckoning of the question.\n\n00:25:42,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n And they'll be right or they'll be wrong. The world will move accordingly, so you know I think it's sort of an interesting dynamic. Um, I also think it's interesting.\n\n00:25:52,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Ah.\n\n00:25:53,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Martin's a very popular figure on Twitter. His analysis is fun to read. I think he's like a good writer and a really thoughtful guy. It's interesting to. to talk about him in this context now, because obviously his history in the industry also gets talked about a lot.\n\n00:26:08,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I actually think he's been spot on for a few of these, but um and he's got a huge following.\n\n00:26:16,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, Matt, you announced positive data this week in your PriVent Phase 3 Valor study. Tell us about it.\n\n00:26:22,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n We did, thanks. And in the past, when I've gotten on and talked about our own data, there's been sort of some Twitter back and forth on whether it was appropriate to have a host promoting something that happened.\n\n00:26:31,320 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I think you're a guest. You're technically a guest this week. I'm a guest.\n\n00:26:34,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll take it. Because I'm going to say good things about it because I'm really pleased with it.

With the sort of black box class morning showing up and people sort of weren't sure where the field was going to go. And our view was. Some whatever baby had been thrown out with bathwater as it was. and that, at a minimum, there was a huge opportunity to continue to use these very powerful mechanisms in severe orphan diseases, where there were not very many other options. Dermatomyositis was our sort of first lead indication, where it's an interferon and L12 and 23-driven disease, where both JAK1 and TIK2 were going to be helpful mechanistically. And bluntly, there really hasn't been a novel therapy successfully developed in a very long time. IVIG. had a positive study, and an IVIG from Pfizer Octogam was approved a few years ago, but IVIGs have been used a long time. They're not really sort of novel and it's a graveyard of drug development. There have been probably nine or ten failed studies in the last couple of decades of major mechanisms. And so we ran this study eyes wide open. I think there were a lot of questions about conduct, about placebo, about sort of how it was going to develop. And we just saw a beautiful separation.\n\n00:27:50,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n We saw a great test delta. We saw a really good set of outcomes across skin and muscle disease. Dermatomastasis is a pretty devastating inflammatory disease of both the skin and the muscle. And we saw— we saw really good benefit across both sort of the standard measures and then also like patient reported kind of disability indices and things like that. Really nice data. And because of the way we ran the study, which had a mandatory steroid taper in it, we were also able to show that we were able to deliver meaningful clinical benefit against a backdrop of significantly reduced steroid burden, which, after the entire conversation, is something docs care a lot about. Really great week for us. Really great week, we think, for dementia and myositis patients and excited to carry this one forward.\n\n00:28:24,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, and now it was Poivant, sorry, Priovant, that's.\n\n00:28:30,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n private and you guys own it so like the roy van would be Because I was just wondering, the Roy Vance stock price, I think very typical of these hub and spoke models. didn't get the same type of value appreciation that you would have expected if this was a Roy Van Holle owned program and if you were more of like a traditional biotech. I obviously know a little bit about this because we. You know, I founded a company that had a very similar model to Roy Vanda PureTech. So I'm curious what your thoughts are on that.\n\n00:29:02,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I, uh, Look, I think. First of all, this effectively is a revenue-owned program. Privant is effectively a 75-25 JV between us and Pfizer. We own 75%. They own 25%. It's really our program. The Privant team has done a phenomenal job running it. Um, You know, I have stock price reaction. I guess like. It's hard to call. There was not a big short thesis going into this data, in part because Reuven had a pretty big market cap and a bunch of other components to it, including a lot of cash.\n\n00:29:30,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n Part of the sort of price discovery pace here is going to be on its own on its own course for a little bigger market cap than some of the other companies that have data readouts. We had run up a bit into data. For a variety of reasons, including developments elsewhere in the business. So I think it's like a little bit hard to pull all those pieces apart. That said, and this is— the commercial part. I'm sorry. I think our setup from here forward is as good as it's ever been, or better. We have now this program, which is exactly the kind of drug that you know Josh and I were talking about earlier. Companies have launched successfully in our space. We have more data coming. For this drug, we have data coming in our FCRN franchise.\n\n00:30:01,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n I care.

Can I just wait on this because I think Roy Vant and, and you know, just a small number of similar companies highlight a couple of shortcomings of, I guess, just the investment landscape. One is that Roy Vant, Matt, to your credit, has put the ROI in RoiVant through your performance today. And yet. You know, probably struggled to get credit that, um, you'll be able to do so in again in the future. Right. I mean, we all recognize past performance is not a predictor of future performance. But, given the Roy Vant track record, you know, you'd think there'd be a little bit of, well, let's give this team some benefit of the doubt that they're going to continue to really generate value. The other challenge that you see in Daphne, you kind of think, kind of allude to this. When you have these hub and spoke models, or even if you don't, if you just have a very deep pipeline of very attractive programs, for whatever reason, investors become increasingly reluctant to ascribe value beyond the first one or two assets.\n\n00:31:23,240 [SPEAKER_4]\n And so it leaves these companies that have very promising portfolios with costs of capitals that probably higher than they should be. Which can make it challenging for them to fund all this incredible innovation. You wind up having to kind of make choices that you might otherwise not have wanted to make just because. Again, you're not getting full credit for that portfolio. So it's kind of an interesting dynamic. To me, it's a bit of a shortcoming from the investment community to not see a little bit forward beyond 'What have you done for me lately' or 'What's on the very near term horizon.' and think a little bit longer term, think a little bit more holistically. about a company and its valuation.\n\n00:32:09,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I think we've seen a lot of that. And that's also been across the board in biotech, this idea that you just got to focus on the key program and get to data. It's partly been a result of the market, but it is interesting that companies that are able to advance multiple programs and maybe don't have as much need to fundraise because they're generating cash elsewhere. Um, I don't think the market knows how to understand them as much. But anyway, let's move on. Josh, I know you track a lot of companies that are private, and you talked a bit about the quality of the private companies that are out there.\n\n00:32:49,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n There's a couple that you've been tracking that announced data this week. Can you tell us more about them?\n\n00:32:53,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah so there's, there is, like, with the IPO window having been closed for so long, the private companies are forced to mature, generate data that otherwise would have been generated in a very binary way in the public markets. And so we are seeing a very different private company, biotech company ecosystem. So a couple of data points this week, the team from Aratea, a wonderful team, who actually pulled the product out of Biogen, aripiprazole, that failed in ALS. But what they saw in that trial was an interesting signal of significant reduction in eosinophil count. So naturally, they repurposed that for asthma, eosinophilic asthma. and you know, after working on this program for for some time, came out with positive phase three results. Uh, so, as a basically an oral option to treat eosinophilic asthma, which remains a very large unmet medical need. So, nice to see that, that data point, not not tremendously surprising, because they had done such a good job characterizing it.","char_start":30099,"char_end":34136,"start_time":"00:30:01","end_time":null}

Uh, so, as a basically an oral option to treat eosinophilic asthma, which remains a very large unmet medical need. So, nice to see that, that data point, not not tremendously surprising, because they had done such a good job characterizing it.\n\n00:34:00,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n But again, now we've got a, you know, another private company that has positive phase three data and have to figure out their own strategy going forward. And then a very different company called Apollo Therapeutics. They're based in the UK, which might actually be an interesting segue into UK innovation and what's been going on lately, but it's another really wonderful team. They've formed a number of partnerships with some of the leading academic centers in the UK to try to tech transfer some of the more promising programs. And so what they just announced was a positive. Uh, data on atopic dermatitis for their IL-17 antibody— the top level results sound quite good. We don't have all the details, just uh the uh treatment arm, not the placebo arm. But again, just kind of reflective of what we're seeing in the private company space with companies being forced to hit milestones, risk or de-risk before they come to the public markets.\n\n00:35:00,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I think ultimately that is very healthy for the public markets at the end of the day. I'm not sure if we want to talk about what's been going on in the UK. Here or save that for later.\n\n00:35:10,673 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, no, this is a perfect perfect segue. Um, so we can talk about that. So over the last week, three big pharma companies announced plans to leave the UK in some form or another. So not fully leave, but abandon different projects.\n\n00:35:27,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n Is abandoning a planned $1 billion pound London Research Centre and withdrawing from existing UKRD facilities in the Crick Institute in London Bioscience Innovation Center. AstraZeneca announced plans to forego a 270 million dollar UK vaccine facility and then Lilly announced it's reconsidering plans for UK Lilly Gateway Labs. And you know, in general, these companies and others have criticized the business environment in the UK, which we can talk a little bit about. It's important to point out, and I think you touched on this with Apollo.\n\n00:36:03,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n That the UK is home to leading scientists, universities, early-stage investors, and of course, a couple of major pharma companies. It has all of the ingredients of a biotech hub like Boston and San Francisco. But it really hasn't been able to. To pick up steam in that direction. And it raises interesting questions of what's held it back. So the issues have a lot to do with over-regulation and what's been pointed to as anti-business policy. We had some really interesting discussions.\n\n00:36:35,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n With UK company founders and investors who have been expressing really unprecedented bleakness about the UK life science environments.\n\n00:36:46,060 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, lastly, it's a tough place to develop and sell drugs and there's also poll factor with Trump administration policies. Pulling companies to make manufacturing commitments in the U. S. So I think let's split this discussion into two. The first part of it is the UK drug pricing model and some of the US policy stuff around manufacturing. And then the second, which we can do. Following that is. This idea of the UK and why it hasn't been able to be a biotech hub. What's missing? So let's start with the first one. And maybe, Josh, you can talk about the UK drug pricing model and some of the policy. Stuff.\n\n00:37:26,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I mean, they're at the extreme end of conservatism in terms of paying for value when it comes to innovation. I think that the challenge, though, is that there's a reason that innovation is priced as high as it is, and that is to incentivize more innovation.\n\n00:37:42,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um and it's interesting because you point out UK really hasn't hit their stride when it comes to bioinnovation. But on the other hand. They're not interested.\n\n00:37:54,410 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, they've made that very clear by having the nice effort to.","char_start":33836,"char_end":38042,"start_time":"00:34:00","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_25081f62c841_chunk_0010","doc_id":"doc_25081f62c841","order":10,"text":"ize more innovation.\n\n00:37:42,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um and it's interesting because you point out UK really hasn't hit their stride when it comes to bioinnovation.

And it's becoming a serious issue as we know it. Now, with the U. S. um, you know, looking for other companies to start paying their fair share for the innovation that they do benefit from.\n\n00:38:22,770 [SPEAKER_4]\n There are all sorts of factors here, including China. In particular, as a country that likely is willing to provide lower source innovation for the globe. China is not quite ready to do it broad scale like the U. S. has been building over the last number of decades.\n\n00:38:46,970 [SPEAKER_4]\n Lighting forces at play when it comes to drug price and drug spend. But it's certainly not unreasonable to ask countries who are going to benefit from the innovation to pay their fair share. And it gets into the broader framework as well, like, like ICER's framework for, for how to ascribe value to drugs. And at least from my perspective, which I think is a little bit different than others might have. Um, the question isn't around value—right. The question is: What's the right framework of pricing to incentivize more innovation?\n\n00:39:21,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n Because that's really the only justification for these high drug prices. And I see very few of the policymakers, the think tanks, the ice-makers of the world, the nice-makers of the world ever sit down and talk to investors or analysts who ultimately are the ones that are going to be making the decision to allocate capital to new R &D outside of the realm of profitable biopharma companies.\n\n00:39:50,900 [SPEAKER_4]\n But that's really all that matters, right? If you create a system that doesn't reward innovation, there's going to be no innovation. And if you create a system that does, there will be. And if you create a system that over-incentivizes innovation, we'll have too much innovation.\n\n00:40:04,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n But that's not the lens that you hear these drug price discussions ever talked about, which I find a little frustrating.\n\n00:40:12,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n Can I just say, first of all, I think you don't have to look that far back in history to see a lot of innovation coming out of the UK. Obviously, there's a few big pharma companies who have done a lot of work there. Cambridge is still a biotech hub. Like, I don't know that it's totally clear— Oxford too. I don't know that it's totally clear what the history there is. I also just, to me, and I'm not close to any of these decisions. This looks a little bit like the UK as a place. is just getting a little bit unlucky in a game of geopolitical chess. In part, this is it's true that drug prices are comparatively low there. They're not that much lower than other important places in Europe, but like, it's just they are the intersection of like a relatively small commercial market. Wearers. Investments had been promised. And I feel like part of what most of big pharma is trying to do is to prove to the Trump administration that the U. S. is getting something in exchange for the bargain that is like critically financial important to them. And nothing speaks louder in the current political moment than like shifting dollars of investment, especially big sum dollars of investment.\n\n00:41:17,160 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I feel like the concentrated group of this activity is as much a signal to the US as it is to the UK.","char_start":37742,"char_end":41458,"start_time":"00:37:42","end_time":null}

I just want to go back to Josh's point that, outside of drug pricing, the UK has done very minimal to understand what type of environment to create to incentivize. to incentivize the company builds and to incentivize investment. Um and to build real innovation hubs, so when we say that, and I've spent quite some time, and I do want to say a call out that I have been on board. So for example, on a board of AppCam, which is is a true outstanding company that was just bought by Donaher. That's an outlier. I'm on another board of a private company called CLM, amazing British company. That's also an outlier. Other than those two and a few handful of others, have a challenging environment that, again, drug pricing is one thing. Environment that creates everything from the regulation of how boards are structured to how to um to the investment environment to having uh incentives to investors to also having incentives um to company founders and company builders, everything from tax incentives to how boards and companies are structured.\n\n00:42:47,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n The UK has a significant issue. And I would love to also hear, Daphne, your thoughts. I know, you know, you've built a company yourself that is on the UK stock exchange. I mean, what are your thoughts? And then I'm happy to also chime in on the issue with the biotech hubs in the UK. And by the way, it's not a recent phenomenon. They've had issues going years, years back.\n\n00:43:13,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. And also I'll note that Michal Preminger just joined us from the audience. She recently was at J &J, and before that she ran the Harvard Tech Licensing Office and knows a lot about biotech hubs. So we'll hear from her as well after I say a few words and then maybe Luba, I think you wanted to comment. So I think that you make a great point about these. You know, these incentives for business. So like the way I look at it is a lot of regulation in the UK is around protecting downside. As opposed to incentivizing upside, and that you see that across the board. So for example, You know, they have you talked about boards. Boards are. Are they? Don't they frown upon board members having shares in the company? Where you think that would align interests, but they worry about conflicts of interest, which doesn't really make a lot of sense. So there's a lot of this regulation that is around protecting. And I think that's important. But the problem is they've missed the upside part.\n\n00:44:14,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n They have this UK takeover panel, which is meant to protect UK investors. But I would guess that that panel has probably lost investors in the UK billions of dollars because of the way that they. Uh, you know, they were kind of over-concerned about Um, the ability to do deals and whether companies will leave the UK. What it ends up doing is it really does make it less interesting for investors there. But I do think it's really interesting because there is such great science, there's great entrepreneurs, and there's great early-stage investors. This idea of the overregulation and the tax incentives, and all of those things, I think, have really been holding back the ability to build companies there. And of course, for the stock market, there is also very challenging.\n\n00:45:04,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, we, for example, we raised money, we listed on the main market, not on the AIM, raised about $200 million in an IPO. And, you know, there's some amazing, very smart investors there. The problem, though, is that the UK government is not really incentivizing investment in the UK. But I think it's a really interesting question of like, what are the elements that create these biotech hubs like Boston? Cambridge and, for example, San Francisco and I'd love to hear more from you Luba and from Michal on that point.","char_start":41158,"char_end":45428,"start_time":"00:41:17","end_time":null}

And, you know, as you know, also I'm on the board of MassBio, so we talk about this quite a bit. And we also meet with similar hubs across really the world, including in Basel and in Cambridge and Oxford.\n\n00:45:55,150 [SPEAKER_0]\n And in the UK.\n\n00:45:58,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n And of course, science is number one and UK has it in their hubs. Number two is access to capital. So number three is often being, again, accessible to hospitals, being accessible to amazing talent of people that don't just start up companies, but they're able to build companies and scale companies and not just the CEO function, but a CFO and other functions. I can tell you, looking at the UK companies. I think that there needs to be additional training just because of the the level, the regulatory level and how companies are run in the UK. There aren't that many CFO and financial level people.\n\n00:46:44,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n that can go and be part of a startup because they think very differently. They think in a way that is not helpful. um to to start up in the UK so yes there are There's a lot of talent in the United Kingdom, which is something that you need. It's something that we have here in Boston and across multiple different areas— so everything from science to law to business to finance we have that. But a lot of that talent is not actually trained to start-up companies or be in a cross-functional start-up environment and build a company for growth. So that is certainly one area for training where the UK needs help. And I think, if the government was open to, again, tone down the regulation and incentivize investors and incentivize talent that can go into the startups, it would be a whole different world for the UK.\n\n00:47:50,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n Michal, I would love to know what you think. I know you've been in this for a long, long time.\n\n00:47:54,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, of course, and happy to share that. The experience of serving on the MassBio board with you. Maybe I'll add a number four to your list. And number four is the presence of pharma companies.\n\n00:48:10,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh, in the same environment as we talk about the Cambridge ecosystem, the idea that you can very easily.\n\n00:48:19,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n As a young company, do what we call the walk and within 25 minutes visit every pharma company and get the access to the expertise and the understanding of what will happen downstream from where you are right now. What regulatory and development considerations you may want to incorporate into your plan early on. You know, the choice of first indication, all of those amazing things. And of course, the cross-fertilization in terms of talent. And I think that, for the UK, to alienate and lose, you know, presence of Big Pharma in that ecosystem, which is already also very distributed. I mean, we, you know, do have the golden triangle in Cambridge, Oxford, but it is, it is a very different phenotype of of an ecosystem and yet, really, amazing opportunities. I can say, just from the J &J experience. J &J has an innovation center in London.\n\n00:49:24,120 [SPEAKER_3]\n Which is serving all of Europe, but definitely the UK ecosystem is top.\n\n00:49:32,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, a top performer there in terms of early stage companies. And again, the challenges of growing and so on— you already mentioned. But I wanted to take us back to Cambridge and the Massachusetts ecosystem and actually highlight.\n\n00:49:48,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, in an article or a white paper that Peter Kurczynski wrote this week— about the Massachusetts paradox and his highlighting.\n\n00:50:00,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, his concern about an environment in which you know clearly there's a lot of support for biotech in Massachusetts, but also it is home to some of the most aggressive, let's say, politicians and representatives who are actually pushing. Policies at the federal level that are very harmful to to biotech and biopharma in general.","char_start":45128,"char_end":49408,"start_time":"00:45:40","end_time":null}

And it is a test case, but really with inspiration, I think, for any ecosystem around the globe. Because we can ask ourselves, you know, if, in Massachusetts, where we are responsible for so much of the economic growth and prosperity, we are still unable to advocate and to get our representatives to support us, how could any other ecosystem expect to do so? So I just want to encourage people to actually take a look at it. I think it is fascinating. It's important for us to be educated about those topics. And maybe we can take one of the next biotech hangout sessions to dig in once people have read it.\n\n00:51:35,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, we can share a link to that.\n\n00:51:37,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'm going to put a link right now at the chat.\n\n00:51:40,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that's great. Okay, so we're almost at the top of the hour, and I know that we wanted to touch on a few other policy updates. Josh, do you want to hit? Real quick, I think the J &J pricing announcement on their bladder cancer drug. impact on CG oncology, HHS, and ACIP.\n\n00:52:00,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, a bunch going on to cover quickly. J &J got approval of their TAR 200, gemcitabine-eluting pretzel in Lexo. Price pretty high, first year of therapy. Uh, for a full course would be close to 750, 000 that that falls to about 150, 000 in the second year because the frequency of administration of the therapy falls in the second year, but just kind of another signal in terms of the direction that drug prices can continue to head. On HHS, there was the HELP committee meeting that brought in Dr. Menardez to talk about her firing from head of CDC.\n\n00:52:46,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would say it was, maybe, like four to one balance in terms of those who are really very concerned about the direction that CDC is headed. With leadership relative to the couple of Republican senators, I think geared their questions more towards. Dr. Moneris and her own integrity, which seems to be fairly impeachable. So we'll see what direction this heads in. There's certainly increasing pushback against RFK's decision-making and policies. And that kind of dovetails into the ACIP meetings that was going on. Yesterday, I haven't been able to watch as much of it today.\n\n00:53:33,100 [SPEAKER_4]\n I don't know, like, you know, it's a very new ACIP committee composition.\n\n00:53:39,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, they're clearly, many of them are approaching questions around vaccines with far more caution than the prior ACIP committee meeting. I think the biggest challenge is that there's just not perfect data to answer the myriad of questions that have been raised about vaccines and vaccine policies.\n\n00:54:02,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n Know a lot of vaccine policy comes down to expert judgment and we've replaced the very pro-vaccine and pro-science panel with a group that You know, we're fairly defensive about being characterized as anti-vaccine. Many of them are asking reasonable questions around safety, etc. I mean, it did illustrate their lack of expertise in the subject matter. And at times made for some very cringy moments, but. I think the big challenge here is that a lot of the discussions are out of the realm of where data can clearly illustrate and where everyone has to extrapolate. Based on the available data, and some are more comfortable extrapolating favorably, others are very uncomfortable.\n\n00:54:49,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n Extrapolating favorably and that's just creating a lot of noise, confusion, and uncertainty. It's it's not a great look, but but I guess from some lenses it's at least an understandable look.","char_start":49108,"char_end":53233,"start_time":"00:50:28","end_time":null}

And I've been a little bit disappointed. I'm not even, you know, not just with regard to vaccines, but in other areas, the advisors that they're bringing in. Um, you know, they have conflicts. They're not pharma companies. They're not pharma representatives, but they have their own personal conflicts, and I think that's a real problem. Anybody else have comments on the policy points that? Josh just touched on before we wrap up the show.\n\n00:55:43,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n OK, so let's just go around and see if people have any closing remarks. I mean, I think in summary. This um it feels like maybe there's some green shoots people are feeling more optimistic about biotech. One missing piece is the public markets. I mean the follow-ons are strong, but not really IPOs yet, with one exception last week, which was, I think, okay. But seems like sentiment has improved substantially since our lows of April. Love to hear from the others, and then we'll wrap up the session.\n\n00:56:17,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would just add: biotech looks like it actually has the makings of a business model, and that's what it's going to take for the sector to thrive from here.\n\n00:56:26,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Mm-hmm.\n\n00:56:27,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n One of the main reasons this is a fun industry to be in is because ultimately, you run experiments and generate data, and it matters for patients. And so that's, that's what dominated my week: it's just, it's, it's exciting to be a part of that. And I feel great for what we've delivered— for dramatically as patients. And what I hope that means long-term. So that, that has painted my week with optimism and just is a, is a fun reminder of why we do what we do.\n\n00:56:54,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I think there's optimistic outlook, and we all are quite optimistic. One of the things, actually, when we talked about the hubs, I was going to mention that the one thing that we have here in Boston, also in California, is: We are hyper optimistic even when the fundamentals are not 100% there. And that's what drives innovation and that's what drives change for patients.\n\n00:57:20,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n Matt, a similar boat as you are right now, looking into how our patients are doing and are doing so well on our trial, and that's what's important ultimately.\n\n00:57:34,110 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, if it wasn't for the optimism, none of these drugs would ever get developed. I mean, I think all of us are really focused on that, on developing new medicines for patients. That optimism, over years and years, and very challenging circumstances, is what enables us to deliver these new medicines. So, yeah, I think it's a very important piece of it. Well, anyway, thank you all for joining today and Michal for jumping up from the audience. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and thank you for joining us on. biotech hangout.

We had Albert Burla, all the key healthcare figures within the administration, and of course, President Trump, so the CEO of Pfizer, President Trump, presenting essentially the first of what is expected to be many, or at least several, deals between pharma companies and the administration, and the likelihood is that they are going to have this pretty much the same template. And we characterize this at our end as a win-win and a lose situation and I think we'll probably almost certainly talk about all of that so the win pretty much comes from the pharma industry and the president. Although, of course, all of these things depend on the absolute details that we get to. But a couple of things that we pretty much.\n\n00:02:01,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Put to bed was a very draconian, most favorite nation pricing strategy which was good to see that didn't come to fruition. Um and also, so the 100% tariffs that the president had announced to come in force on the 1st of October were obviously put to bed because these deals are starting to roll out. So that's great news. And of course, as you can see from the share price reactions, the in general the market and investors have seen this as positive for the farmer industry. So what did we get? We got we got we got uh President Trump got essentially two key targets of what he was looking for. One is all drugs sold in the US should be made in the US. I think a lot of pharma companies were already going down that route.\n\n00:02:51,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n So that's great. And I think a vast majority of drugs are already manufactured in the US. Of course, we can all then discuss what does that mean to be, inverted commas, manufactured in the US? Where does that? Decision gets made. In terms of, is it fill and finish, is it the final product, is it where is it so, let's leave that to discussion later. We get some job increases and you know this all is culminated over the past few months in what we've totted up to be about $432 billion of ledgers by pharma companies and some large biotechs. Which of course include ongoing R &D, ongoing CapEx, and some new manufacturing facilities, etc. The U. S. gets a possibility of at least aligning non-U.S. Prices closer to the U. S. We'll see how that will work. Interestingly, I was just on a call with a UK physician, KOL, earlier today, and I asked him if I gave you a survey of block prices.\n\n00:03:59,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n The UK, would you be able to fill it? And he said, well, no, because nobody really knows what the prices are. And each area has got its own situation. And in fact, a lot of pharmacies aren't allowed to give out the net prices that they pay. So that's interesting as to where these calculations are going to be made. Nevertheless, That is a positive. And I think pharma companies are almost certainly going to end up launching every product, not the majority, which has been the case. First in the US now, because you want to set the price there and go and hope that the Europeans and other countries pay their fair share.","char_start":0,"char_end":4134,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_433066c16b44_chunk_0001","doc_id":"doc_433066c16b44","order":1,"text":"theless, That is a positive. And I think pharma companies are almost certainly going to end up launching every product, not the majority, which has been the case. First in the US now, because you want to set the price there and go and hope that the Europeans and other countries pay their fair share.\n\n00:04:34,469 [SPEAKER_2]\n And, you know, it seems like the majority of the impact is going to be on Medicaid and Medicare. I wouldn't call it an impact because I think what we're going to end up with is actually more volume going through these various channels, particularly the direct-to-consumer channels. And let's see how that all pans out. And lastly, so those are wins for the administration, wins for the pharma industry. I'm sure there's a lot more detail folks are going to talk about in a minute. The loss is Europe. And the losses in this form, if you have launched your product in the US at a price X, you go to Europe and say, 'I'm very sorry, but you're going to have to pay at least the net price equivalent of X.' So let's say that's a 30% discount, not 70%, not 80%, not 60%. And Europe goes, 'Okay, fine. I'm going to increase my drug budget, which is great for pharma.' Number one: No, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm not going to increase my drug budgets. I'm going to accept your price, but I'm going to have to restrict the drug even more.\n\n00:05:37,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n So that's another loss, right? And that's, again, good for pharma because they get the higher margin even if the volume is lower.\n\n00:05:45,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then get the same revenue. And then of course, the other one is, which is the worst case scenario, which doesn't really, I can't count it as a win for Fama, but it's certainly a lose for.\n\n00:05:55,359 [SPEAKER_2]\n European setup and patients is that they go no—actually, we don't want the drug. Now, in some cases, I think that might happen. I think if you had a situation, I'm not particularly picking on, say, oral SIRTs, but let's say the oral SIRTs come along with essentially a major convenience factor. Which will translate.\n\n00:06:15,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n To better patient adherence and of course longer term better outcomes, but let's say that's welcome and the companies are going well, you know the competition is essentially generic, so we're going to have to be a lot higher price and I think that's the sort of situation where we're going to have to think about how do we model that going forward.\n\n00:06:35,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n So let me leave it at that. And Eric, you can bring in everyone else, see how they want to.\n\n00:06:40,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, wonderful. Wonderful recap. Thanks. And I should have also introduced Brad Lonecar. I didn't realize Brad was going to be joining us as a speaker as well. But welcome, Brad. For the broader group, following Sam's terrific recap, is this a win-win-win? Are we kind of done now with this massive macro overhang around drug pricing that's really been weighing on the group? Are we still worried about something else? Coming into the forum.\n\n00:07:11,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think in today, you know.\n\n00:07:14,640 [SPEAKER_3]\n these days, uh, you should always expect the unexpected. So I wouldn't uh say it's a guarantee of smooth sailing going forward, but I do think it was a genius move by Berla. And if you. see some Wall Street Journal reporting. It seems clear that this is something that he and Pfizer did on their own. This wasn't a coordinated negotiation by the industry, so to speak, or all of the other major companies.\n\n00:07:46,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know I really think that He's in a unique position. I think that Albert Berla is. Arguably, the only pharma CEO who really has name recognition and gravitas with the general public, given how visible he was during COVID. And just the way he literally tweets and continues to kind of speak publicly these days, I think that most people don't know who the other. Big Pharma CEOs are. So I think it. It had a little bit of an element of gravitas to the announcement because of, you know, who he is.\n\n00:08:25,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, I agree with everything that Sam said, and I think that he basically gave away almost nothing, and he gave Trump the political victory that he needed.","char_start":3836,"char_end":8103,"start_time":"00:04:34","end_time":null}

And now, you know, Pfizer and arguably our industry, if all the other companies sign similar deals, have a little bit of pressure off for the next few years.\n\n00:08:52,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n can worry less about legacy products and focus on investing and the revenue streams that new products are going to have. So I think it was a good deal for our industry. I think he was the right person to do it. I think he was arguably the only person that could have gone first in this way. So my biggest reaction to all of that was like, 'Thank you, Albert Berla, for basically doing all of us a big favor and also scoring. Our industry— a PR win to the public, you know, making us all look like what we should be trying to look like, that we're trying to to do things to you know to to help people out there. I thought it was a Truly a great news item for all of us.\n\n00:09:44,380 [SPEAKER_4]\n Brian, Jeroen, what's the impact on Biotech? We mentioned that the XBI is breaking out into new levels we haven't seen, I think, really since 2001. Are we in a biotech bull market? Are generalists going to be interested with some of this news flow behind us?\n\n00:09:59,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think we're in.\n\n00:10:01,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would say I think we're certainly in a rotation to biotech. I mean, it just seems like, over the last couple of weeks, there's been this awakening to health care being. You know, a kind of a very valuable, you know, undervalued sector amongst a lot of overvalued sectors. And, you know, I mean, that sort of bled in. To biotech, which has been arguably like one of the bigger underperformers in healthcare, which is one of the biggest underperforming sectors over the last few years. So it certainly feels like, at minimal, you know, somewhat of a, of a reversion to, to more of normalcy. I mean, it's hard to say bull market, right? I mean, it's definitely a two-month bull market, relative to where we are, were, but, but, you know, it's still a relative bear market to, uh, where we are on a performance basis, via screen back to like 2020 of course. But, um, It does feel different, right? I mean, to Brad's comment, I mean, I kind of tend to agree, like you always expect the unexpected, particularly with this administration. But it does seem like we're in a bit of an environment where good news is good news and bad news is good news.\n\n00:11:03,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n People are using any reason to be at least a little more invested in the sector. How durable is that going to be? Um, I think there's a long way to go just to revert to sort of more of a normal valuation basis. Across a lot of these names. So you know, will it will we go into like, really the fanfare of a bull market? I think that remains to be seen, but there's still a lot of upside even if it doesn't go into that type of dynamic.\n\n00:11:30,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, I totally agree. And I'm sure you guys can all back me up. I'm happy to announce that we're getting generalist inbounds, which is unusual. And these are real generalists, not the biotech sort of fringe generalists, but real generalists who are calling, not knowing a lot about the sector. The feedback we're getting is that interest rates are going to come down. They're getting a little bit worried that tech cycle is going to start ending at some point sooner than later or on the horizon now. And they're rotating to the next risk level, the next alpha generator, and that, for them, is biotech. And starting to look at interesting names like an Ionis, like Argenix, like these UCBs. They're sort of fresh new names for people to look at now.","char_start":7803,"char_end":11791,"start_time":"00:08:25","end_time":null}

They're sort of fresh new names for people to look at now.\n\n00:12:16,390 [SPEAKER_0]\n To your point, Brian, so I'd argue that, Eric, I remember when I was growing up under you, right? We had to be stock pickers and we wanted to be in an environment where we're useful. And what we mean by that is that companies that had good values actually went up. Uh data that didn't work out, companies actually went down, and things actually acted rationally. I would argue we're finally back to that level. Hard to say that we're in a bull good. I think we're just sort of a— you know, um. We're finally back to value recognition, and we're still underperforming. You know, our trackers in the beginning of the year said we're going to underperform the market and we should be flat for the year. So I think we're tracking back to that flat year over year. Which is sort of where we think we should be for this year. And then hopefully next year is a better year.\n\n00:13:07,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's funny you said that, Yaron. I still get a lot of chiding from my friends who read that Wall Street Journal quote that you just referenced of mine from 20 years ago. I said, 'You know, companies that had good news had their stocks go up and those that had bad news had their stocks go down.' It was a genius piece of insight on my part. I'm glad you remember it as well. It still works.\n\n00:13:29,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n I hope you're right. Go ahead, Sam.\n\n00:13:32,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, just sorry. I don't want to take that particular conversation away. But in terms of what is still yet to be worked out, and I don't know whether you guys have got this sussed or not, but I'm not. Quite sure where specialty drugs sit in the middle of all this, in terms of even the new launches having to be priced at whatever MFN will be, which is kind of decided by US pricing. I don't know. And I also wonder, just a throwaway comment here, now that RFK has shaken hands with Albert Burla, do we think the heat is off mRNA vaccines or is that too much wishful thinking?\n\n00:14:11,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n Those are great points, things that we need to keep in mind as we look forward. Yeah, I mean, from where I stand, Jeroen, you must be a more popular guy than I, because I haven't gotten a lot of generals calls. We've gotten a couple, I will say, and even that is a sea change. In optimism. Getting any calls, I'd say, from generalists is something that we're not used to in the last six to 12 months.\n\n00:14:33,990 [SPEAKER_4]\n And then, Brian, you made some really perceptive comments. I hope that we're in a glass half-full environment, but I also worry that things are changing so quickly that we may start to see, um, you know, even aggressive posturing where data sets don't only receive the benefit of the doubt, but they get all of the doubt.\n\n00:14:57,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n Where by-siders start believing everything that management teams tell them.\n\n00:15:01,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n When markets, you know, trees grow to the sky, grow to the sky in terms of market opportunities.\n\n00:15:07,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Where all political headlines are dismissed as just being just that. So there's a fine line, I think, between optimism and pessimism. And unfortunately, I don't know that we've handled that line very well historically in our sector. I feel like we're always on one or the other side of it.\n\n00:15:25,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n And we just can't help ourselves due to other factors. But hopefully this time will be a little bit different.\n\n00:15:31,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, it's probably, Eric, to your comment, there's no way I'm more popular than you. I think it's purely probably a function of what we cover, perhaps. And so the names that are resonating, and maybe that's kind of what's getting traction. Look, this is the new Tron show, innovators, right? Frankly, at this point, they're not even new. So we're talking about like the Argenixes, the UCBs. Ionis is the sort of new kid on the block now that's resonating with people.","char_start":11491,"char_end":15726,"start_time":"00:12:16","end_time":null}

Ionis is the sort of new kid on the block now that's resonating with people.\n\n00:15:59,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, terrific SMIDCAP innovative growth stories that are just turning that cusp into profitability as well, which really will. I think helped the XBI going forward. But let's turn our attention to maybe some of the other headlines from the week. Uh, there was a little bit of chatter and controversy coming out of the FDA. Brian, you want to start us off on that?\n\n00:16:22,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, yeah. This is kind of a fun story to kind of follow. So earlier this week, Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was recently appointed head of the FDA's CDER, this is the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This is the center that really reviews most of the drugs that got approved by the FDA. He put a posting on LinkedIn, indicating that Cedar will be looking at surrogate endpoints used for FDA approval and criticizing some of the failures to confirm benefit. He cited the Exxon skipping drug. So there's like Sarepta's, Zondas 51. And I think we all know at this point, this has been one of the biggest sources of criticism for accelerated approval, this drug in particular, but the other axon skippers as well. But he also interestingly took specific aim at a drug called lupkinus or vocalosporin for the treatment of lupus nephritis, saying that it has significant toxicity in it. not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients. So this is kind of odd because lufakinis actually has full approval based on a 52-week randomized placebo control trial.\n\n00:17:23,116 [SPEAKER_1]\n An old study. And I guess, look, one could reach for an argument that a complete renal response is not a direct clinical benefit, but a measure of UPCR and EGFR improvements together. But in the world of approved drugs that really haven't confirmed a clinical benefit, I would say. This is very, very far from an egregious case study for a very senior FDA official to be citing, at least from the information that's publicly available. Now, Adam Fierstein at Stat wrote this up. It was definitely going around through the biotech gossip channels this week because Tim Marsh was actually once the CEO of a company called La Jolla Pharmaceuticals, but resigned in 2019. When Kevin Tang from Tang Capital, who's the largest shareholder and chairman of La Jolla at the time, it was quoted in the PR announcing Ted Marsh's departure. Notably, the largest shareholder of Orinia, at least as the last filing, is Tang Capital as well. So once this all started to kind of blow up. Tidmarsh. wind up deleting the post saying that it did not reflect the views of the FDA or HHS.\n\n00:18:24,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n Arinia also issued a press release titled 'Ariana Responds to Now Retracted LinkedIn Post.' And that PR just reiterated that it had received full approval from the FDA. So those are kind of the facts there and in the background, everyone's sort of like scratching their head. You know, what was the relationship back in the day between George Tidmarsh and Kevin Tang back at La Jolla? And are there any implications to such an? Odd, um, citation from from his LinkedIn profile, um, as a critique of of accelerated approval here and you know, obviously this has kind of implications for um, you know, sorry, to the scientific rigor at the FDA. And, you know, I know we all have differing opinions on the level of chaos that this current FDA currently has. But we'd love to hear any thoughts from you guys on that.\n\n00:19:17,030 [SPEAKER_4]\n We can go into the chaos in just a moment. Jeroen, did you want to also note the Iowa Biotech News?\n\n00:19:23,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, so Iopio, you know, also, this is a cancer vaccine that's fairly unique. They had amazing phase one slash two data. They're targeting iodine PD-1, PD-L1, and, admittedly, not a controlled study out of one center in Europe, but really sort of noxious acts of data. They did a phase three that just read out. A lot of the KOL feedback is that the study was a little underpowered, and it looks like that was probably right. I mean, they just missed. It was 0. 06 on PFS. Survival obviously was underpowered, but trending in the right direction.","char_start":15426,"char_end":19858,"start_time":"00:15:59","end_time":null}

Survival obviously was underpowered, but trending in the right direction.\n\n00:20:03,050 [SPEAKER_0]\n So interesting tidbits in the data as to in which population you work. This is frontline melanoma, by the way. and so they went to FDA, I mean very very safe by the way, on top of uh, on top of uh, Ketruda, and showed better data than you would have expected on Keytruda alone. And this is a controlled study in any event. Remember, this was an important case study just given. Some of what CBER has said in the past, admittedly, they were more skeptical about PFS as an endpoint and vaccines, but admittedly, it was more on the mRNA vaccine. Thank you. And there was a question whether they'll be able to file because they literally just missed, and whether there'll be flexibility. And the answer was from FDA was no, you need to run another study. So we're, you know, the next test test case is potentially going to be, and we're going to talk about this shortly as well. We're going to see data from Zanza in CRC phase three data from Exalexis. And that's going to drive questions about what to expect from studies wherein most of the patients are coming from ex-US.\n\n00:21:06,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n But FDA is continuing. We're all trying to figure out what is this new flexibility going to do from FDA? And it's not necessarily going to be that easy to call— kind of what we're seeing on our side. It's kind of been, there's flexibility, but it's not always what you expect.\n\n00:21:21,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yvonne, real quick, I just want to echo what you said and say that my personal take, for what it's worth, which is nothing, is that I think the FDA made the wrong call here. I visited this company in Denmark and also interviewed her shortly after the data came out. And um uh, the person running this company, my Brit Zoka, is a very serious researcher, so this is definitely not a case of like a hype CEO who's whipping up investor fervor to get something approved that should not get approved. I mean, this barely missed, as you said. And I think this is an example of p-value worship. That's not in the best interest of science or patients. And I understand why the FDA might not want to. Make precedence or, you know, really vary widely on how different things, you know, are treated.\n\n00:22:23,230 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe in different ways, but to me this would have been a classic example of: if you really look at this and say, is there a signal going on here? Maybe this deserves an accelerated approval while we take the years that it takes to run another study to see if it could confirm or not. To me, it's a great example of what would have been the utility of something like that.\n\n00:22:51,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n So obviously that was a close call, a tough decision that the FDA had to make. Brian mentioned the chaotic. LinkedIn.\n\n00:23:01,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n release from George Tidmarsh. It's good to know that I'm not the only one in here who doesn't know how to use social media. There was also a case of a drug being rejected, a Fortress Biodrug for Mencke's disease, based on another CMC issue. They received a CRL. By my count, we've had Ultragenyx, Biogen, Scholarock, and now Fortress all getting relatively recent CRLs in orphaned pediatric indications. These are all drugs that probably should have been approved. So the bigger question is, how are we feeling about the FDA? How would you guys rate this leadership team and its ability to execute?","char_start":19558,"char_end":23247,"start_time":"00:20:03","end_time":null}

How would you guys rate this leadership team and its ability to execute?\n\n00:23:40,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, can we just double-click them? We've talked about this in the past in Ultragenyx. And Ultragenyx, this is UX111, gene therapy for MPS3. And remember, this was going to be the first test case under CBIRS, which was really Peter Marks' accelerated approval pathway. They got a CRL because of a few sort of idiosyncratic manufacturing-related numbers of temperature probes they need to do on shipping. The FDA actually came out and said, 'So this is what we mean by interesting, the way they ended up handling it.' They said on the clinical side, the data looks really good and it's acceptable, not for accelerated approval, but for full approval. Based on the data, which was single-arm, not controlled against historical control. Um and, based on the the benefit from the baseline, so they skirted the whole question of an accelerated approval, but they showed flexibility and potentially proven them down the line in efficacy, but they got to work out through the manufacturing issue. So, kind of very equivocal sort of how to read that.\n\n00:24:43,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I guess my point, Jeroen, was we got three, sorry, four CRLs all due to CMC. So again, Biogen, Ultragenyx, as you referenced in detail. Scholar Rock and now Fort Chris. It seems like a lot. I mean, it just seems like we're not. getting through the workflow that we need to have happened on a CMC standpoint, which really shouldn't be that hard for some of these indications. Biogen's drug, Spendraz, is already approved, for God's sakes. So I was just referencing maybe some some execution the steps there, but But again, the bigger question is how you guys feel about.\n\n00:25:19,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n about leadership.\n\n00:25:21,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n Good point. Good point on that. Yeah, especially on Spinarasa. Good point.\n\n00:25:29,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n No one wants to pick up that potato. Go ahead, Brian.\n\n00:25:32,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right. Not great.\n\n00:25:35,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n Look, I mean, I think.\n\n00:25:37,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n I've been saying this all year, and I think this is sort of like a top-down issue. Is there just seems to be chaos and inconsistency, right? I think the problem is, there seems to be a huge gap between, um, you know, in sort of like idiosyncratic decisions on safety and efficacy on applications, where sometimes there's this enormous level of flexibility and other times there just seems to be no flexibility at all. And it just doesn't seem consistent. And look, I mean, I think.\n\n00:26:11,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n Know it's complicated, probably, by you know, the different views in HHS, right? And I know we've talked about that before, but right— like Like Van Ey seems like such an odd duck to have in in this administration, where he classically is. You know, I think perceived by most people as an over-regulator, someone who would be, you know, all in on having a very powerful FDA. Um to really demand high-level safety and efficacy studies, but at the same time, Marty Macari goes out there and just talks about looking at just preclinical data and maybe approving things just based on AI. So there is this disparity and it's very hard, I think, to, from an industry perspective, to kind of hone in and say, 'Oh, this is sort of the level of evidence that one needs for an approval.' And I think because of that inconsistency, it becomes quite hard, right? And I think more and more, and this is not just a criticism of the administration, but the prior administration, the administration before that.\n\n00:27:16,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's more and more of a demand to try to characterize who is the person who has ultimate power to sign an action letter and what's their opinion relative to the review division and what's their boss's opinion relative to their opinion, because these things have mattered more and more where one person will feel fine with just overturning everyone else below them's decision on something. And I think that's been a concerning trend that's been going on for a decade or more.","char_start":22947,"char_end":27285,"start_time":"00:23:40","end_time":null}

And I think that's been a concerning trend that's been going on for a decade or more.\n\n00:27:48,380 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think you're right— this administration, this leadership team at the FDA, did not start that sort of top-down inclination to overrule senior staff members.\n\n00:27:58,679 [SPEAKER_4]\n And that trend has been ongoing for a while, but it does seem like it's potentially accelerated in the last few months, if not years. And we're seeing more and more two-tiering of systems at the FDA where the top brass have an idea of where they want to go and what they want to do. Maybe it's more politically motivated. Maybe it's higher-level policy stuff. But they haven't spent the time to bring along the senior staffers underneath them to their view. So the senior staffers are continuing to conduct reviews. Continuing to be very I'd say rigorous and conscientious in their workflow.\n\n00:28:36,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n But often it doesn't really matter. And that seems to be somewhat problematic. You referenced just how hard it is to read this agency. I sense that that may be part of the problem.\n\n00:28:52,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, well, let's move on to some of the big company news of the week. We had yet another meaningful merger and acquisition this week, M &A, I think it's now. five straight weeks of meaningful deal flow. in biotechnology. In this case, it was one larger biotech, GenMab, buying a mid-sized biotech in Marist. The acquisition was valued at about $8 billion, about a 41% premium to where Marist had been trading. And the acid here, of course, is marasipidazeptamab. It's a bispecific candidate that hits EGFR.\n\n00:29:28,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n LGR5 directed at patients with head and neck cancer. The product that the fetal symptom is in. Two phase III studies: one for first-line and one for second-line head and neck cancer. GENMAB has talked about. Also doing additional trials in earlier stages of the disease. Um, The other derivative impact here is the company that we're involved with, Baikara, was up even more than Meris week to date. Baikara is up almost 50%. I think Maris is up about 37%. What's interesting about that is that Baikara is Meris's chief competitor. So, you know, you might want to ask, how can the competitor that didn't get acquired perform? or outperform the company that did get acquired. I think there's a lot of sense from investors that there's heated strategic interest in head and neck cancer, a tumor type that really hasn't seen much innovation before. I think now there's some discussion also that there might be other interested parties and strategic transactions that Baikara can benefit from.\n\n00:30:30,850 [SPEAKER_4]\n And even before the Marist news, Baikara was getting the short end of the stick from investors. It had about one-eighth the valuation of Marist, so maybe not surprising to see that.\n\n00:30:41,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n That disparity in valuation close at least a little bit. But I don't know, Sam or Jeroen, did you guys want to add into this discussion?\n\n00:30:54,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n On. Yeah, sure. I mean, look, it's one of the questions that I immediately ask myself: why didn't any of the larger pharma companies do this?\n\n00:31:05,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n Of course, it doesn't matter from the sell side. The dollars that GenMap's paying, I'm sure, is just as valuable as the dollars that a large pharma company would have paid. The interesting thing, of course, here is that I'm sure you've got your view of Baikara and Baikara's data. We do view the Meris data as as more broadly applicable in the patient populations, having a look at the HPV1 negative and HPV1 positive patients, etc. But the question therefore ends up being, what happens if somebody with deeper pockets or broader shoulders does come out? And take up by Cara, what does that mean for gen map in terms of marketing this product in the longer term? So those are questions that are, that you know, I'd be interested to see what you guys think. The data in, we could debate the data right at the end of the day.","char_start":26985,"char_end":31243,"start_time":"00:27:48","end_time":null}

The data in, we could debate the data right at the end of the day.\n\n00:32:00,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n They're not directly comparable, different follow-up periods, etc. It's harder to make a hard judgment on this. And of course, GenMap could have gone and taken out Bycara, but I think the calculation they made is that they need something that's going to be on the market by 2027. And I'm not sure that that is the case for Baikara.\n\n00:32:24,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n So that's the read I've got. And of course, the sense that we got from our valuation analysis. The company also said is that the colorectal opportunity here is kind of not really in the calculations and that's an upside as is probably some of the early earlier uses of the drug so I'd love to hear what, uh, your own and you guys think on that on that on that comparative efficacy and and the risk to general about now that it's got a that is going to be a competitor to whoever takes bicara out or if somebody takes bicara out Yeah, go ahead, Eric.\n\n00:33:01,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n Nope, not all year you're on.\n\n00:33:03,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, we cover GenMap. So GenMap, we give them a lot of credit. They're a smart team.\n\n00:33:11,460 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know the challenge in biotech is you it's like uh you know like the incredibles right remember when when I forget the the sun runs and he's like first and then the dad yells him to be second. In biotech, when you're so successful, in this case, it's Darzalex, you know, eventually that party will end and it's very hard to offset that royalty stream. And so they're really trying and getting aggressive.\n\n00:33:33,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, the deal is definitely um, not cheap and um, you know, our colleague Tara was extremely bullish here on Miras and she had a great call on the Gen Map side. They're taking on a tremendous amount of debt. Just in between the interest expense they're accruing and the loss of interest income from cash is about $430 million, we calculate annually. So it's fairly diluted. Because you're taking OPEX on top of it. So it's going to be meaningfully diluted for two years. And then the data looks really, really strong. And as you said, Eric, there's the question of why is Baikera?\n\n00:34:09,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n Undervalued and because the data doesn't look necessarily that different, I think it sounds like we're both bullish on this area. On the genmap side, it's a huge bet because at this point they are fully levered, and there's no room to do anything else. It just kind of um tells you that for good assets, you still have to absolutely pay top dollar.\n\n00:34:30,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n This, plus the other things that they've done, really starts moving them away from that Darzalex cliff, especially if a Kinley works. But they took a lot of risk, which we'll see if your planning pans out.\n\n00:34:42,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n Very quickly, I'll just add and say I think this is aggressive, but I do think it's riskier than is being talked about because nobody knows definitively what the response rate of Pembro is in this setting.\n\n00:35:01,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n We've seen real randomized data and, until we see a randomized phase three study with this asset or other assets, this is a classic example of where IO has really surprised people once you actually do randomized trials. So I think that's a risk. And then, commercially, maybe: why did a big pharma company not step in here? This is a classic case where, in today's day and age, there's literally 100 Chinese companies that will sell you one of these for pennies if you are a little more patient and have the scale and all of that to be. To not worry about not being first to market and and all of that, and and you know, eventually making it further on down the line, so I think it's risky for those two reasons as well.\n\n00:35:49,840 [SPEAKER_4]\n Good points, Brad. What about the broader theme here, guys? We have seen substantial M&A each week this fall— for now, four or five weeks running.

Brian, you have a thought on that?\n\n00:36:12,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I have a tendency to think it's a little random, but I think people will really push back on me on that and say, you know, it's pharma sort of waking up to the valuation starting to move and trying to take the opportunity to get in before they move too much. But I've always found it kind of hard to.\n\n00:36:31,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n find more than just a little bit of an idiosyncratic nature to when M &A is a car. Outside of when it's like a particularly um big area that pharma has you know acute demand for like I remember HEP-C there were just a lot of MNAs going on there um you know maybe in the GLP-1 space you see a little bit of it uh now but um you know outside of that I guess I'm call me call me one of the more skeptical people that this is like a open door of MNA that's starting to occur eric just just let's not forget though I mean I'm not going to disagree with Brian because I'm not sure there's a crystal ball that anyone has I mean every year that we started I think Tim or any banker would tell you, I have a great book of M&A coming up.\n\n00:37:13,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n And of course, this is like the third year that the first half was slow. And then the first quarter, and then it really picked up. But you do have people looking into the horizon at lower rates. right so the opportunity for refinancing down the road can be meaningful.\n\n00:37:33,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n At a lower rate and of course nobody knows what that rate would be, and at the same time, as a general we can't just keep waiting until rates actually hit like 2% or whatever it is they're heading to, because they have this cliff, and they had to do something, right? Was this the right asset or not? Brad's point is good.\n\n00:37:52,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n To try and get that answer for you, Brad. Are people paying just pennies for assets out of China? I doubt it. I've got the numbers. One day, I'll add them up and send them to you. I don't know. The point is, that isn't a risk. But at the end of the day, the cost of capital should be getting lower. You can't wait for the day that it happens, but at least you can plan forward like that. So there's one element there that could be driving some of this. And of course, more certainty is coming back into this. pricing environment, the tariff situation, which I think, as time passed, people got more and more comfortable. But then, of course, the Albert Burla and the administration conversation kind of put a cap on that. So perhaps there's some of that, although GenMap, I'm sure, had made up its mind way before the announcement from Pfizer and the administration.\n\n00:38:46,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, it's also, you know, this is nothing new, right? Deals get done on de-risking events when the buyer is comfortable and the seller has gotten remunerated. And I think it's also, we can't ignore the fact that the market is fondly remunerating companies, so they're much more comfortable selling now.\n\n00:39:06,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n That seems to be kind of our thinking here.\n\n00:39:09,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n I agree with everything you said. I do think there is some stochastic nature to deal flow and nobody really can time their release or their transaction to anything else.\n\n00:39:20,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sam, you're right. The macro has changed dramatically and with MFN. tariffs and some of the other issues behind us we finally coming out of a nuclear winter not just for biotech stocks but also for pharma transactions so I would hope to. we would see some more of these. Let's continue to move on to some of the clinical data sets from the week.\n\n00:39:42,740 [SPEAKER_4]\n Disappointment this week was the Moon Lake Therapeutics News.

Not sure if others cover this company. I don't, but we do pay some attention to. The Hydrogenitis Supertiva space, the HS space.\n\n00:39:55,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n Moon Lake and their drug. We're thought to have potentially a best-in-class opportunity here with an IL-17 Alpha. Unfortunately, Sotolocumab not just failed to differentiate itself versus the incumbent UCB's Mimzelex. but also failed to achieve statistical significance on one of two phase three studies. That really puts the drugs approval in jeopardy in a way that I don't think anyone would have predicted.\n\n00:40:25,340 [SPEAKER_4]\n A lot of folks trying to game how differentiated so look about might have been versus been selects into this data set but. But no one expected this disastrous result, the stock's down over 85% this week and I think looking forward. It's really unclear how this company gets moving forward. This was a pretty major binary for the industry. I think a lot of us woke up on Monday morning not sure how the XBI was going to perform around it. Because there was so much cap and interest on this event. And yet we shrugged it off and moved on. And again, maybe.\n\n00:41:06,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe saw a bigger picture that was more favorable in terms of. Other companies doing other things at valuations that are reasonable but Brian, why don't you introduce the Larimar news? I know that was also an interesting situation.\n\n00:41:20,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, another interesting situation, regarded as negative on the day of, but has been climbing back pretty strong. So management's been doing a good job with investors getting them over the line here. Larimer is developing a drug for Friedreich's Ataxia and their update was on their clinical study, which is potentially a study that is approvable under subpart H. I think that's the thesis here. And this drug, it's a recombinant for taxon, which is the protein that's deficient in FA. So the endpoint of this study is actually for taxon levels in skin, and they've already shown good levels in earlier data cuts. And this week they showed in 10 out of 10 patients who had six months up for taxon treatment, more than 50% of normal for taxon levels in skin measurements. They also showed a median improvement from baseline in MFARs of 2. 25 points. And this is a primary clinical endpoint in FA studies. It was the basis of approval of Biogen's Skyclaris following their randomized controlled study. But this is an open-label study. So not an RCT, but showing similar effect size to Skyclaris from baseline.\n\n00:42:21,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n So this is all good. But they also announced that, out of 39 patients dosed in the study, seven of them— or 18%— experienced anaphylaxis. The stock closed on Friday at five and change and was in the low threes when it opened earlier this week. As I said, management's been doing a good job getting investors comfortable. It's climbed back to the mid fives or mid fours right now. I think the debate here is really— skin for taxing a surrogate. That's reasonably likely to provide a clinical benefit and how much evidence is Larimar generating to make that cause. So I think most people would agree that, if you could get functional for taxon levels in the tissues of interest, this would be a no-brainer for subpart H approval. But skin, for taxon, it's not a direct measurement of a tissue of interest, it's a surrogate tissue. Of a tissue of interest. And we don't have measurements of the tissues that would be ideally measured for this study. But it's a very good marker in terms of the amount that they're showing in skin.\n\n00:43:22,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n But the question becomes, when you sort of introduce this very real risk now of anaphylaxis. How confident can one be that, you know, the skin for taxon measurements and an improvement in baseline MFARS scores in an open label study, is that enough to kind of support? The argument that this is reasonably likely to predict. So, fully expect this is going to be another big FDA approvability debate as we get closer and closer to. Sort of their final cut of data, and they're talking about submitting a BLA for subpart H in the second quarter of next year. So, you know, one to watch closely.","char_start":38840,"char_end":43230,"start_time":"00:39:42","end_time":null}

Um, you know, the far association the advocacy group here is very powerful. A lot of people think. They had a very significant role in ensuring that the FDA approved Skyclarus itself, which was a subject of a lot of controversy on the street back in the day before Biogen bought it. So, you know, look forward to following that one over the over the next year or so with the FDA debate.\n\n00:44:27,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Great recap, Brian. Did you or Sam want to cover Ananta as well? And their RRSP?\n\n00:44:33,250 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure, I'd love to cover Ananta. I've been following that one for a large part of my career since they were one of the main players in Hep C.\n\n00:44:43,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n They press release data from their respiratory syncytial virus study in high risk patients on Monday. And this is an antiviral for us. We've had a couple of recent vaccine approvals for RSV, but this is for the treatment of RSV. And pre-market, it was down as it missed the primary endpoint, which was the reduction in lower respiratory tract symptoms. And generally, we look at phase two studies on when they miss primary endpoints.\n\n00:45:08,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n People kind of throw them out and certainly started to look that way as down 20% pre-market. And then it started rebounding and has been way up. Since about midday on Monday. And, you know, while we were kind of reviewing the data pre-market, I was telling my associates, 'I was like, oh, I kind of actually think this. data is pretty good. Am I crazy? And my associates were smarter than me. They're like, 'No, no, you're right.' This is like pretty good data. And I think, when you look at it, the question is— like, what is an antiviral supposed to do for this disease? And, you know, it seems like it's doing all the things that you would want into antiviral. I mean, you've shown very, very clear reduction in viral load, good separation from placebo across the study. They're showing improvement in a number of metrics across the overall study beyond just sort of the four-symptom lower respiratory tract symptoms. And most importantly, perhaps, the pre-specified subgroup that they were looking at of more high-risk patients—those who are sort of elderly, 75-plus patients, or with comorbid COPD— showed much more robust results.\n\n00:46:18,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, you know, I think RSV and look, I mean, Enanti sort of had a tough run in that. I think they're really good at making drugs. They've just sort of gone after indications that have been really hard to define a true clinical benefit or move the needle in since their day is in hep C and I think respiratory viruses would all all agree it's a hard indication to sort of chase because so many of these diseases resolve in most people so quickly, it's hard to even ever, ever pick up a benefit unless you're running huge, huge studies. So here, I think what they were successful is they found a high-risk population that you know, you would truly be worried about. With an infection.\n\n00:46:52,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Not statistically significant, but there was a pretty significant number of patients on control who wound up hospitalized.\n\n00:47:00,319 [SPEAKER_1]\n For RSV versus on treatment. And that may just be random noise, but I think with all of the other data points, it's pretty supportive that they have around antiviral here for this infection. So now the question is, is the data good enough to find a big pharma partner who would be interested in developing this as sort of a product to put in the hospitals or older person homes to try to intervene in patients who or high-risk individuals coming down with an RSV infection. And, you know, I kind of think it is.\n\n00:47:37,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thanks, Brian. Awesome recap.

We've, of course, got major medical conferences and kicking off for the fall. I know a bunch of us are going to. Going over to Berlin to see what's happening at ESMO, so we'll talk about that. Right around the corner for better for worse is is earning season as well. So I thought maybe could all chime in on on what types of prints we're looking for and maybe who's who's most at risk for seeing performance around their Q3 earnings results. But let's start with the Q4 conference season. Sam, I know you're going to Berlin. Jeroen, are you going as well?\n\n00:48:29,840 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm not gonna miss going to Berlin. All right.\n\n00:48:33,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe we should do a version of biotech hangout from Berlin on the ground in a few weeks. Just the three of us. Yeah, I love it. I love it. But what are you guys looking for? What are you most excited about seeing?\n\n00:48:45,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n Your own, go.\n\n00:48:47,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, for us, it's three things to boil it down to. And I think they're actually all late breakers, interestingly enough. So Amgen's going to have, remember they bought. a company called Five Prime to get your FGFR2B antibody for gastric cancer based on that promising phase two. So we're going to see the first. phase three. It's called the Fortitude 101. It's the phase three results. These are patients that are overexpressing that fibrogen growth factor receptor in gastric or or gastroesophageal. This is the combination. This is the doublet. And remember, Amgen said they hit the interim analysis on survival. Um, they continue to follow patients and it looks like the latest cut on survival doesn't look as good as the first cut. Then there is a second study, which is the triplet, so it's a chemo Be my papa. With IO.\n\n00:49:43,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n Face they both of them face— I'd probably be next year. So that would be the first one. Um, This one that's in progastric because it's the FGFR.\n\n00:49:55,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n The next DXL, so they did the file to Cobb. Cobb was it? It's called Zen.\n\n00:50:05,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n This one is controversial and important because they did hit survival.\n\n00:50:11,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n In all patients in refractory colon. So that's really good. But we don't know what drove the benefit. Was it across all patients? They also had specific subsets of patients with liver meds who don't do as well. And of course, the one thing to keep in mind is, and this is important for FDA these days, most patients in the study were enrolled outside the U. S. And there's also a question whether, okay, great, so you beat regorafenib, which is, you know, no longer the standard of care. It was approved 12 years ago. It's sort of like the weakest kid on the block. But how do you do relative, you know, across studies to the stem of the care, which is two other drugs that do a lot better. So that's going to be really important then to figure out, with the new FDA, just having a survival benefit against an old standard is not even relevant when it's conducted XUS. And then, finally, and Eric, this is your turf. We follow BioNTech, you obviously follow Summit, but they have the data. With Ivanesimab, that's their PD-1 VEGF bispecific with chemo, head-to-head against Tavimbra with B1, you know, Beijing plus.\n\n00:51:22,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Chemotherapy so remember this is Harmony Six. They beat it in China. This is squamous non-cell small cell. They beat it on PFS and now see the data. And again the question is: okay, great. So are you actually going to show survival benefit or not? But I'm not sure the data is mature enough. And hopefully we'll be able to at least look at trends. So all three late breakers are all important ahead.\n\n00:51:47,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sam, what do you what's on your radar?

But here on Harmony 6, I think what's going to be interesting is the comparator arm is, of course, the Cisplatin with NAPACETAXEL and NAPACETAXEL and CARBOPLATIN. There, we have data in China. When you look at it, Comparative to the Keynote 407 data, that of course is Keytruda, it did look better there. So, medium PFS seemed a little at the same follow-up period, right? Early, seven and a half or so months. So the interesting thing would be how the control arm performs in this trial, one that we need to look at, which is that was the rationale. Thank you. 307 file but um uh and PFS as uh as um your own rightly said is quite interesting and and this is remember this is squamous cell carcinoma. So a non-small cell across. And this is a group of patients that normally would avoid a VEGF inhibitor. And in all the studies that we've seen in the subcutaneous from even the 3S-Bio, Pfizer drug.\n\n00:52:55,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n and the variety of other ones that I've tried to dig up, you don't see the usual problem of haemoptysis, which is bleeding in those patients. which would be the result of VEGF. Remember that at the WCLC, the discussant of the Harmony data said that all he sees here is VEGF activity. So that kind of continues to argue against that comment, if you think back to that time. that this is just VEGF, which of course I think most people thought that wasn't that— wasn't fair. So that's going to be interesting to look at, of course. As your own said, the one other thing that we're looking at is this: there is a trial from Remgen, which is in gastric cancer. And guess what the target is? PD-1 VEGF. It's an interesting combination. It's in gastric cancer, a combination of there. Uh. So it's going to be, of course, safety will be the biggest question here. Clodin 18. 2 ADC plus the PD-1 VEGF, so RC148. And or.\n\n00:54:00,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n A PD-1 inhibitor and this, in this case, is Jun Shi's PD-1 log Torzi. So look, it's a trial that's not necessarily enormous, but we're very interested to see how this looks. What are the? Is this another budget that's going to show up and no one really has talked about this particular one? So that's one we're looking at, just as something that is, uh, off the beaten track and of course, you still have all the, um, Astra, you know, they're in, in, presidential, uh, session one symposium and they have the first two Destiny breast, best Destiny breast 11 and 05, where we're looking for, um, significant efficacy data from there, and I'm pretty sure that it's going to be very good in terms of the readout. Because they've already said they've been statistically and clinically meaningful datasets. So we'll wait and see how this all pans out.\n\n00:55:02,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, I mean, we could keep going on, but I think this is enough for the conversation today.\n\n00:55:08,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n No, thanks. You guys covered the summit, Ivan Escamab or actually, the Keso Ivan Escamab. Harmony 6 trial quite well. Thank you. I think it's going to probably be a little bit early to see overall survival.\n\n00:55:20,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n But, like the two of you, I'm very keen to see what the hazard ratio is on PFS. We've got a couple of other Smidcap names that are going to be at the conference as well. Ideya has a drug called darovacertib, which is in ocular melanoma with a neoadjuvant update of around 90 or so patients. I think that's also an oral presentation. So I just highlight that as something that has continued to look very, very interesting. In ocular melanoma, a tough tumor type with very few, very, very few alternative options.\n\n00:55:55,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n I just want to say that, Eric, that was also on my list, but I thought I'd had enough.","char_start":50913,"char_end":55069,"start_time":"00:51:47","end_time":null}

That's going to be a good product, in my opinion. And then we're also looking at Veristem in the G12D space. Their partner, another Chinese player, Genfleet, will be presenting now. A pretty good cohort of data in pancreatic cancer. This, of course, is looking to try and get a share of a market that's seemingly dominated by revolution medicines, but the efficacy data from there— G12D on-off inhibitor— has looked really good. They've had some tolerability considerations that need to work around. Again, I just highlight that in pancreatic cancer, another tumor type that's in dire need of innovation. It's been quite interesting.\n\n00:56:38,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n We've just got a few minutes here. What's on your.\n\n00:56:42,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n Bingo cards for Q3 earnings. Any companies in particular that have a lot to gain or lose as we start to turn the clock forward.\n\n00:56:53,339 [SPEAKER_4]\n Jeroen, you cover a lot of the big guys.\n\n00:56:55,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, So, Argenix we think is probably going to be okay and in line. Um, after a huge Q2, so we think that should be okay. Legend, we just published a note today.\n\n00:57:07,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n To recall, they're making Corvicti with Johnson & Johnson. It's a BCMA for myeloma. They're the market leader right now. And there have been capacity constraints. They've been growing capacity between their current sites in Jersey and in Belgium.\n\n00:57:24,320 [SPEAKER_0]\n And that's been taking, probably, a little bit slower than expected. I just kind of think, if any one of us does a renovation of an apartment or a house or whatever, how long that takes. Think about building complicated global plans. So they have been bringing more capacity, but it looks like there's going to be an incremental expansion in Q3. And because of it, it looks like they're probably going to be a smidge in light. Still growing mid-teens quarter over quarter, but not the 20% Wall Street was looking for. It looks like the new capacity is really going to be kind of late in Q4.\n\n00:57:58,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n So the $1. 9 billion consensus, they can probably still hit. That, but they might need to kind of to to round up the numbers to get to $1. 9 anyway next year. Hopefully, when they're finally not going to be capacity constrained, but um, legend— we've been fielding a ton of questions on Ascend. This is looking good. And I don't know about the rest yet.\n\n00:58:22,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n What about BioNTech and Moderna with their vaccines?\n\n00:58:25,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n You've been tracking them?\n\n00:58:27,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, you go ahead because I know you're tracking them. They're looking down 50%, right? They're not looking good at all. Go ahead.\n\n00:58:33,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, they're not looking great. I mean, it's hard to do a week-on-week comparison. Comparisons, um, because of the different starts, but if you put them on the same, I don't know if I'd say 50, but they look down the difference. What's what I find interesting your own. I don't know if you looked at that. Moderna doesn't seem to have done much with pricing, but based on our data points, Pfizer seems to have taken a price rise this year. So that might mitigate some of the pressure. But that's what I'm looking at. But then I don't cover as many stocks as you do.\n\n00:59:05,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, the answer. COVID vaccines are sort of a nice to have these days, only for certain populations, you know.\n\n00:59:13,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n Brian, you get the last word on Q3 earnings.\n\n00:59:16,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I would just kind of note, you know, I think there's some interesting launches underway that people will be very focused on. You know, Gilead, obviously, this will be sort of the first quarter of launch of um the Lena Cap of your prep, which has been, you know, really the driving force behind the re-rating over the last year and a half. Vertex will get another quarter of Jernabax sales, or there's their pain drug that really launched at the very beginning of this year.","char_start":54769,"char_end":59144,"start_time":"00:55:55","end_time":null}

So, you know, I think a lot of eyes will be on that one.\n\n00:59:54,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n Terrific, guys. Thank you very much. We are out of time.

My name's Tess Cameron. And my co-hosts today are Sam Fazelli, Luba Greenwood, and Brian Scorny, as well as Yaron Werber, who's going to be joining us shortly.\n\n00:00:20,010 [SPEAKER_4]\n For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to our most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. So we have a lot to cover this week, as usual. And I wanted to start with just a short pop quiz to my great co-host this week. When was the last time that we saw the XBI, or when was the last time that we had a biotech hangout with the XBI at, like, dancing around 105?\n\n00:00:50,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's easy for me to answer. I've got the Bloomberg right in front of me.\n\n00:00:54,180 [SPEAKER_4]\n No.\n\n00:00:56,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n So tell us, Sam.\n\n00:00:57,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'll let people who don't have a Bloomberg in front of them to guess. Thank you. Brian?\n\n00:01:06,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh, that's a good question. Maybe 2022?\n\n00:01:10,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, it was not 2020.\n\n00:01:13,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n It was not 2022. It was 2021. No. Yeah, we have to go all the way back to 2021.\n\n00:01:22,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n to be at a biotech hangout where the XBI was, you know. Over well, I think now it just dropped to under 105, so over 104. Let's call it that. Um, so that's uh, you know, obviously exciting to uh, you know, really see more interest in biotech and having that be driven by a lot of fundamentally good news. And I think one of those pieces of good news that we want to start with today is deals and M &A. And there was a nice analysis that I saw come through from LifeSci advisors, where they were pointing to year-to-date M &A, and this was before the stuff that was announced this week. Being at around 81.\n\n00:02:11,629 [SPEAKER_4]\n billion with a lot of deals over a billion dollars through September. And I think that $81 billion is a real increase from 2024 full year, not quite at the highs of 2023.\n\n00:02:26,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n Actually, just looking at the number of deals.\n\n00:02:31,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's just here to date with a couple months left in the year. You know, we're looking at a about 30 deals, more than that now with a couple of deals that were announced this week. And that's actually pretty in line with full years for many. Of, you know, many of the past couple of years since 2020. So let's get into some of those deals that were announced this week. And Sam, maybe I'll start with you and Akira and Novo Nordisk.\n\n00:02:59,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, sure. But if you don't mind, Tess, just beforehand, I want to highlight something. If you look at these deals that we've been seeing, so Akira Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Mitzera. Think about the story behind them. This is the reason people should be investing in biotech in general, or at least that's the reason that we put forward as the reason to invest in biotech, which is one reason. Is pharma needs pipeline. So we had Pfizer. I mean, I can keep going backwards, right? But let's just take these two examples. Pfizer tried to develop their own asset in obesity. didn't work out, straight away, they went and buy it in. You're either in license, you buy it in. In this case, they bought with Zara. Novo Nordisk, one of the leaders without dispute in the obesity, metabolic disease world.\n\n00:03:54,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n It prides itself on the mash space with an FGF uh 21 approach, didn't look compelling, buys a company. That is why I think people should be thinking, and I think that's why perhaps the market's picking up for the sector as a whole. I'm not obviously talking about any specific stock here. Um, this is what happens. Pharma companies need pipeline. They hit a brick wall. There are assets out there available. And of course, we all want them to buy the company that we have on our list or in our portfolios. But in the end, it's good for everybody. So in this particular case, Tess. We have nobody's buying. Um, and this is I don't know the sixth week in a row that we've had an M&A deal. And maybe tomorrow we'll have two with the rumor about Johnson and Johnson. So this is a deal which Novo Nordisk announced yesterday, $5. 2 billion up to for Akiro. And froxifermin is, based on our analysis, has leading efficacy data.","char_start":0,"char_end":4414,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

And maybe tomorrow we'll have two with the rumor about Johnson and Johnson. So this is a deal which Novo Nordisk announced yesterday, $5. 2 billion up to for Akiro. And froxifermin is, based on our analysis, has leading efficacy data.\n\n00:05:00,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n There are other things to consider, of course, in the MASH space. So the metabolic liver disease that follows often obesity or not even in some cases obesity.\n\n00:05:14,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, You don't have to be overtly obese to have potentially some MASH ongoing. So they showed some compelling data: 40% fibrosis improved. Movement at 24 weeks, 75% growing to 75% at 96 weeks. Lots of details we can go out here, but when you look at the entirety of the trial. It was strong, better than what we've seen with some of the others, and of course, continued to evolve and get better over time. It looks better on efficacy. Than definitely what Novo Nordisk had themselves. It looks better on efficacy if you don't adjust for placebo. If you do adjust for placebo, it's slightly different, not that much better than Roche's 89 Bio Acquisition because of Furmin. And then, of course, when you come to GSK Boston's Femusfermin, which of course, these are drug names that we all love because they get so convoluted in terms of the structure.\n\n00:06:14,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n of the names. But they all show good resolution. Of course, in these trials, you have to be very careful about what patients were included, F1, F2, F3. But with the Akiro, we've even seen some good results on F4 patients in the symmetry trial, 39%. There was improvement, et cetera. And MASH resolution is three times placebo. These are all very significant data. Then of course you get to solubility and safety and you look at it, and it's kind of in the inverse, and you get GI effects side effects with the Acura product that is higher by the look of things than the data that we see from the other drugs. But interestingly, discontinuation rates are all the same across these. So who's got the best product? Who knows? But these GI side effects do worry me a little bit if we're going to be looking at a combination with semaglutide. Which is obviously the acting ingredient in Big Ovi.\n\n00:07:13,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then, um.\n\n00:07:17,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then lastly, it comes down to dosing. Currently, the dosing for the Acura's compound is once weekly. You get the 89-biodrug that's twice weekly and pre-filled syringe, as opposed to a lyophilized powder. And then, of course, you go to GSK's possibility, potentially a once-monthly dosing. There are other side effects that we need to keep an eye out for, particularly bone mineral density, which is supposed to be a class effect, but there seems to be some differences between the drugs. All in all, 'It's the acquisition that Nova's just done appears to be bringing it what looks like the best efficacy. in fibrosis improvement. and particularly F4 disease.' But on the side effect profile, maybe they have some issues relative to the others. Of course, time will tell. These are all relatively early studies. And then dosing needs to be worked out. And maybe if you're going to get it in combination, how do you do that?\n\n00:08:18,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Again, I want to highlight, this is Novo Nordisk, which is one of the the key players in this space, i.e. Obesity, MASH, and they have already semaglutide that's got good MASH data. Let's not forget, a lot of folks got worried. When the GLP-1 once started reporting MASH data saying, 'Wait a minute, what's the investment case for these guys then?' Which of course— The folks who had thought about it long enough knew that this is a disease area where combinations are likely to be needed or drugs following. GLP-1s are not going to be the answer to everything. and and here nova proves that investment thesis so it's great to see of course we have a whole bunch of other companies that are still in the space um and they will be interested to see how that goes And that's it. I'll leave it at that.","char_start":4116,"char_end":8218,"start_time":"00:05:00","end_time":null}

I'll leave it at that.\n\n00:09:08,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n But I think it's interesting, Sam, maybe just building on what you said. I mean, there's some companies left in the space, but we are looking at such a different picture. for um nash companies than we were a couple years ago right or mash companies Um, And, you know, there were, you know, so far this year, right, just in the even just in the past couple of weeks now with the Kiro and 89Bio. you know, Boston Pharma. earlier this year with GSK. I'm having a hard time thinking about another company that is like independent clinical stage biotech with you know, a clinical stage FGF21, right? They've kind of been snapped up. And I think that certainly the focus on cardiometabolic by a lot of strategics has been a part of this. I also think that all of these companies have a lot to thank Madrigal for, for really showing that the market really is.\n\n00:10:11,970 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, uh, you know it— that it really is a big market and that there's uh, you know, a high enough unmet need to really support uh, you know, a price point that can help deliver on a very robust peak sales number. So, you know, it's a very different place than we were looking at a few years ago.\n\n00:10:33,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let's have a bet, Tess. What's your bet that in six months, three, six to 12 months, there will be a whole bunch of companies that come out of the woodwork, assets that people have forgotten about, with a slight twist on them, with an FGF21? or even other mechanisms that are going to end up coming out of stealth or not even stealth, or even I haven't looked yet to see what's happening in China. Are there assets in China that folks are going to go and bring in and create new calls out of? I bet you there will be.\n\n00:11:02,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n I would not bet against you, Sam.\n\n00:11:08,530 [SPEAKER_4]\n So let's go to the other deal this week, the BMS orbital deal. And maybe, Yaron, you could kick us off here. And Sam, I know you have comments on this one as well.\n\n00:11:20,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:11:22,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n Hopefully you can hear me okay. So. The next innovation in CAR-T is really going to be an in vivo sort of bedside L &T driven modalities.\n\n00:11:35,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n So this is a $15 trillion deal for Orbital for a CD19 part-team using their proprietary mRNA platform to deliver it in vivo.\n\n00:11:45,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n We're seeing a lot of that now, both on the BCMA side, obviously several companies working with CD19, and they're all early.\n\n00:11:55,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of concept already in the clinic, in general in this space. And look, we know that even J &J is definitely looking at some preclinical assets.\n\n00:12:06,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Targeting VCMA as well, as much as they think Corvicti is a winner. Obviously, everybody is looking for something a lot more easier and it doesn't require a phoresis and it doesn't require really, I mean, ultimately sun conditioning and obviously processing. So that's definitely a hot space worth following from now on.\n\n00:12:26,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n Absolutely. And Sam, what do you have to add on that?\n\n00:12:28,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just to add a little bit. Remember, this is an acquisition by a company that's got, pretty much in our view, the leading anti-CD19 CAR T in Brianzi. Um, so my assumption is that this is going to be, obviously, when you read the press release, Orbital has been focused on the I &I application.\n\n00:12:48,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n And for INI, and I don't know your own, I'm sure you, I think you agree in that you can't go with the standard CAR T process, right? You need to have this. In vivo approach to off-the-shelf approach to make it a lot easier for those sort of patients to to to to take value from it, unless you're aiming at the absolute end-stage autoimmune diseases. So it's interesting that it was Bristol-Myers that did it. So any CAR T company, as Jeroen said, you talk to. is talking up the idea of in vivo, which of course is logical. It just makes it so much easier to deliver these agents and make it so much easier not to worry about academic versus community, et cetera, et cetera, particularly in the oncology space.","char_start":7918,"char_end":12387,"start_time":"00:09:08","end_time":null}

Spot on. The AEs of the traditional approach are just non-starters. And that came out very clear about a year ago at ACI. For ionizing.\n\n00:13:43,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I think we're seeing a lot of, you know, interest in really this transient, you know, this transient approach, right? So within the in vivo CAR-T landscape, right? Like there's a lot of different ways to think about and look at the in vivo CAR-T landscape.\n\n00:14:01,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n Certainly one is just— is it transient or non-transient? And in the kind of non-transient bucket, you have a bunch of different. integrating approaches, right? So, Interius was one of those that was like an integrating. You know, CAR T.\n\n00:14:20,589 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, I think it's interesting with both Orbital and Capstan, which I think they shared a similar upfront. A similar upfront acquisition amount for very early, either late preclinical or early clinical companies. Um, And I think it'll be interesting to see how the different applications for these companies really emerge in terms of. Um, The. Uh, you know, autoimmune and uh, you know, I think with uh, you know, potentially both orbital and capstan, which which really had leads in autoimmune uh, you know, the non-transient approach like that, sorry, the non-transient approach really does seem to lend itself there, right, for these, you know, broad patient populations.\n\n00:15:12,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n Dealing with something that is certainly a very severe disease, but non-lethal. And it'll be very interesting, I think, to also see how the you know, how the integrating approaches evolve over the next several years with, you know, I think Interius really being the, you know, deal that's happened on the internet. integrating side this year. I think these couple of deals that we've seen in the in vivo CAR T space also really go back to Sam's point about a lot of the M &A this year. really being about like filling out. Pipelines and filling out the early side of that. You know, of that, you know, the early side of the R &D pipeline as well with platforms like these in vivo CAR-Ts that can be applied across a number of different disease areas. And I think another theme on that early pipeline build-out for pharma companies that we wanted to hit on are these AI pharma deals.\n\n00:16:18,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n And Luba, you've been watching those very closely, and we'd love to get your insights and perspectives on a few of those that happened this week.\n\n00:16:36,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n Luba's just been picked off. Oh, Luba's being kicked off. My goodness. No, I mean, who dares do that?\n\n00:16:44,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n Who dares kick Luba off? We know that Luba will return.\n\n00:16:48,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n It happens all the time on Twitter for some reason. It's probably a lawn.\n\n00:16:54,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n But never to Luba. Maybe it happens to us, but never to Luba. We will restore that inequity quickly. But while we do that, let's talk about. Uh, you know, let's talk about, like, we have one side of the ledger—ma, um— that has actually been returning a lot of capital over the past a couple of months to uh, investors, particularly biotech specialists as well as some of the um, you know, larger mutual funds that have pretty high biotech exposure, like you know, Fidelity and Janus and the like. And so, hey, capital deployment, there are obviously a lot of opportunities to deploy capital in biotech. And we've seen follow-ons, a lot of follow-ons on the market. And we have started to see some IPOs on the market. So I think that there have been nine IPOs this year. We had almost all of those were IPOs that happened in January or very early February. And then there was nothing. And then there was LB Pharma. And now we've seen MapLite flip their S1.","char_start":12087,"char_end":16234,"start_time":"00:13:32","end_time":null}

And now we've seen MapLite flip their S1.\n\n00:18:00,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n And MapLight is a company that is really looking to improve on CoBenFi, which was the drug that Karuna developed that was acquired by BMS and is currently being launched. Um, and MapLight is really looking to, you know, kind of optimize and improve on CoBenFi, and they are raising money to fund trials in schizophrenia. And I think this is really another great example of biotechs kind of leading the way and showing Big Pharma where there is a lot of opportunity. And, you know, Karuna really did that, you know, through their data, you know, Ceravel as well. And MapLight really coming out with what they view as a potentially even superior version to that. And so they have flipped their S1 and we'll get to see over the coming weeks just how that IPO unfolds.\n\n00:19:05,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, it it does draw on a theme of continued interest and recognition that there's a lot of really important innovation that we need to follow in neuroscience. I mean, AbbVie and acquiring Gilgamesh, you know, a psychedelics company, is another great example of that this year. These are big markets with a lot of unmet need and it's encouraging to see continued investor interest in these areas. I am hopeful that we now have Luba's speaking rights restored, which is fantastic. So Luba, why don't I turn it over to you on the theme of filling early kind of pharma pipelines, including with, you know, kind of capabilities and platforms. Tell us about these AI deals this week.\n\n00:19:52,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thanks so much. So AI, we've seen there's like a love and hate, love and hate relationship between pharma and AI.\n\n00:20:00,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n Initially, everybody wanted AI platforms, then everybody was platformed out. Then pharma decided to build their own AI capabilities. Now they realize that they should stick to what they know. And partner with AI companies. So we've seen quite a bit of AI platform technology partnerships with pharma. So what I mean by that is anywhere where artificial intelligence is enabling discovery or translation. So first, I'd like to talk about the recent deal that AstraZeneca just signed with a company called Algen Biotechnologies. It's for 555 million, which we don't know what the upfront is, but it's more. A buy a box deal, but still pretty exciting, pretty exciting for Algen as well, and shows commitment of pharma like AstraZeneca to utilizing AI and drug discovery. This one is in particular targeting to find new targets in immunology. It's a multi-target research collaboration, so not just around one target.\n\n00:21:05,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n And what Algen will do for AstraZeneca is they have a platform called Algen Brain. And they'll be using that platform to identify and not validate novel targets, specifically in immune-related diseases. And AstraZeneca will get exclusive rights to develop and commercialize any of the resulting therapies that Algin Brain will find for them. AZ is not taking equity stakes. Sometimes in these deals, pharma companies structure it so that they take equity positions. Here, that's not happening.\n\n00:21:38,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n And why is this interesting and exactly why did they choose Algen versus others? What's really neat about it is that Algen technology provides AI and also combining functional genomics and CRISPR screening and CRISPR modulation.\n\n00:21:55,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n And it maps out basically a causal link between gene regulation, disease progression in human cell types.","char_start":15934,"char_end":19730,"start_time":"00:18:00","end_time":null}

They're using high-throughput screening, AI models, all to figure out which genes are therapeutically actionable and which ones are not. It will help a company like AstraZeneca with translation from, you know, human biology and our understanding into immunology and finding novel targets around which they'll have exclusive rights. AZ has been pushing into cell and gene therapy and they want to expedite the discovery in that space as well as discovery in advanced modalities. They did also earlier this year do a multibillion-dollar deal in this space. So it's all pushing towards the right direction for them.\n\n00:22:48,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n A great deal and also very good for AI in general. Again, even with all this enthusiasm, I think if we step back, we haven't yet seen an AI drug discovery enabled drug that has been approved in immunology. But that doesn't mean that that's not going to happen soon. So that's one AI type of drug discovery.\n\n00:23:13,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n Preclinical translational biology type of a deal that we've seen. We've also seen another one with a company called BenchSci. I'm actually on the board of BenchSci. It's a fantastic company based out of Canada in Toronto. Where probably people know University of Toronto is one of the top places for software engineering and that type of talent. So they have just done a deal with Sanofi, which is a licensing deal for three years where Sanofi will be using a platform that BenchSci has built called Ascent, also for preclinical research operations. So this is where they're taking, think of it as a disease biology AI co-pilot. Where it takes in the scientific literature, proprietary data that internally Sanofi has, experimental metadata, and graphs it out into basically a biological evidence knowledge map. So it can help you everything with triaging your targets, making a better experimental design, and optimize it.\n\n00:24:18,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n And generate hypotheses and new mechanisms of action. So all good news for those companies and AI that want to partner with pharma.\n\n00:24:27,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Thank you so much, Luba, for that great overview. I think sticking with the new mechanisms, Nilo Therapeutics is a company. That launched on Wednesday this week. And they are taking a pretty interesting approach to the immune system. So tell us about that, Luba.\n\n00:24:48,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, thank you. I have been personally obsessed with this type of mechanism of action, and just—uh— the correlation between the mechanisms, understanding the effects of regulation of circuit in—uh— in basically brain-body pathways, right? And vagal nerves and just a nervous system and how it relates to regulating the immune system. Uh, and so I'm super excited. There's been a lot of research, and I think I talked about this a bit before in some of the other podcasts. I think this is super highly unfunded area. I was wondering why more— more companies, more funds— are not interested or looking into it. So now that I saw this, I got very excited. So what is Nilo? It's a biotech. They were in stealth for many years. They just raised $101 million in series A funding. And what they're doing is exactly what I just mentioned. They're modulating neural circuits to kind of control immune system and therefore inflammatory diseases.","char_start":19430,"char_end":23146,"start_time":"00:21:55","end_time":null}

They're modulating neural circuits to kind of control immune system and therefore inflammatory diseases.\n\n00:25:55,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n I love just seeing what they come up with and learning how the brain connects to inflammation. Their thesis is, if you go after and you target your central master regulator circuits, like body-brain pathways, you can coordinate multi-pathway immune modulation in a much better way and with less resistance. So the science is built from an academic institution of Zucker's lab. And he has been shown that there are certain neurons that actually can dial in. Dial up or dial down inflammation in certain animal models. So again, very early the evidence is in animal models, but I think has a lot of potential, not just for them, but I think for the whole field. So I wish them luck. They have quite a great backing, Column Group, DCVC, Lux Capital, Gates Foundation all participate in this round. So I don't know, Tess, if you've seen anything that comes across your desk in this space.\n\n00:26:59,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n I just, if you do, that's great. I love it. You should fund it.\n\n00:27:03,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, it's a really interesting approach and great to see them moving forward.\n\n00:27:08,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n Luba, we're sticking with you. We're sticking with you for a few minutes. This is why we needed to make sure.\n\n00:27:13,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n Now that my mic is on.\n\n00:27:16,250 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, you've got to make me work. I like it. Exactly.\n\n00:27:18,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n Exactly. This is why we needed you to come back. So we've talked about, you know, money kind of coming back into biotech through M &As. We've talked about where some of that money is being deployed. Tell us about new funds, Luba.\n\n00:27:33,120 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so I love seeing new funds. I think everybody in biotech, if you're an operator out there, we're all very excited whenever there is a new fund, especially a well-capitalized fund that is interested in, you know, that has an investment thesis that is broad. Um so this is. We have a new one. I think I'm pronouncing it as senta'. Um, I think I'm pronouncing it correctly. Capital you are. Yes, I think okay. You know, I um, if I'm not, I apologize to the founders.\n\n00:28:06,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n But they're two ex-Moderna leaders, and they just closed on a new fund. They're out of Florida, which sounds nice and warm today. And it's a $325 million fund. And what they're looking for is— they're looking at development stage biotech, so things that are in the clinic, phase one, phase two. They're looking into companies that have multiple assets, so not a single asset, but multiple drugs in the pipeline.\n\n00:28:35,960 [SPEAKER_2]\n I like that they're not passive backers, right? They're sort of not saying, 'Hey, we're going to deploy this money.' They have already deployed. They say up to 100 million in six startups, including some companies that we've covered here, like Odyssey.\n\n00:28:51,649 [SPEAKER_2]\n And again, I also like that they're kind of reducing the risk by providing and partnering on the technical, operational, and scientific side. And they're also pretty open across multiple therapeutic areas. So I think their approach is good and it's always nice to see. New entrants into the field.\n\n00:29:13,270 [SPEAKER_4]\n Wonderful, fantastic, okay, well, uh, we'll give you a short break. Luba. From all that. All right.\n\n00:29:21,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n And let's move on to some of the data that we've seen come out over the past week. We've had a number of readouts. And let's start, Sam, with one that you've highlighted, which is Arcus and their monotherapy data in renal cell carcinoma.","char_start":22846,"char_end":26711,"start_time":"00:25:55","end_time":null}

All right.\n\n00:29:21,910 [SPEAKER_4]\n And let's move on to some of the data that we've seen come out over the past week. We've had a number of readouts. And let's start, Sam, with one that you've highlighted, which is Arcus and their monotherapy data in renal cell carcinoma.\n\n00:29:39,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, sure. So, Tess, Arcus is best known for the story of Tigit, right? Which is the deal they have with Gilead. Which still is ongoing, despite the fact that many other tidbits—excuse me— in terms of the approaches that they've had from some other companies have been shelved. But this is not about Digit. This is about a drug that targets HIF-1-alpha. Uh, where there is a drug already on the market from Merc, and that's belly rate. That's for a very specific group of patients with kidney cancer. And this time, these guys have now pulled together the data from those ranging study. About 121 patients' phase one data and, frankly, it looks pretty good. You know, I mean, it is a dose-ranging study, so that's that's important to realize when you're looking at the AEs specifically.\n\n00:30:37,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n And it's a $5 billion addressable market, based on our modeling. And they've shown what looks like better progression-free survival and response rates that we've- seen with Merck's Welly Reg, although obviously we're doing cross-trial comparisons, and one's 121 patients, the other is 374 patients, but 121 is still respectable.\n\n00:30:58,830 [SPEAKER_3]\n And we find that at least preclinically, there was some reason to think that this difference might exist. And now this suggests that you might be seeing it. In the clinic too. So what are the differences? Like 12. 2 months median progression-free survival versus 5. 6, which is a big difference. Now, median follow-up is pretty decent for the casdatifan data. Remember, the Wellerig is Belzutifan. So median follow up is about 15 months. So this progression-free survival, we'll see how that evolves as time goes by. Isn't it? And then you've got a confirmed response rate of 31%, which is better than the 23% that we've seen with Relirig. Side effect profiles seem about the same. Grade 3, 4 AEs, 60% for one, 62% for Merck. Discontinuations not available for these guys, but 6% for Merck. Grade 5, we saw some in the Merck trial, but not necessarily related to the drug.\n\n00:32:01,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n So in general, it looks pretty decent.\n\n00:32:05,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n None of the anemia, which is, of course, part of the package with this approach, led to discontinuations. So the data looks quite good. We think that there's a room for this. And the share price duly responded. On the day that it was released, it jumped from at the close of $13. uh 35 cents back on the friday the third of october to a peak of 16 and a bit dollars and it's now settled down a little bit higher of course it's a bunch of patients from different dose groups put together it's a phase one single arm and we need to see the progress of this but it's nice to see this happening and it's interesting that this was a drug that Gilead backed away from and they stayed with the with the TIGIT, which We're going to get some more data from AstraZeneca at ESMO.\n\n00:32:58,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n We'll see for the Artemidio 1 trial. Let's see how that pans out. And these guys, Tidget, are in the same sort of idea in that they're not FC active. And therefore, there is something that these couple of companies— that are left in the space— tout as being a key element of why they're able to continue, whereas the others, Roche et al., had FC active.\n\n00:33:23,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sorry, then FC Silas, then FC Active. So good news for these guys. And we'll see how that all pans out over time.\n\n00:33:33,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n Great. Thank you very much, Sam. Well, Sam, you were talking actually in the topic that kicked us off, which was the Acura acquisition. We were talking about metabolic in the metabolic space and just how much activity is there. And I think we're actually at a pretty interesting time where I think in the next six months, we're actually going to start seeing a lot of readouts on new mechanisms for obesity.\n\n00:34:03,880 [SPEAKER_4]\n And new mechanisms that could actually be applicable across potentially a few different disease areas. And one of these mechanisms that there's been interest in and then concern about is CB1, right?","char_start":26411,"char_end":30827,"start_time":"00:29:21","end_time":null}

And one of these mechanisms that there's been interest in and then concern about is CB1, right?\n\n00:34:21,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n CB1 had historically seen some weight loss. Novo acquired Inversago that had a CB1, and they came out with some data in the end of 2024. That, you know, I think underwhelmed a little bit in terms of weight loss. And there were also concerns about the neuropsychiatric side effects. And I think those concerns were recapitulated in a diabetic kidney disease trial that came out this year. Now, there was a lot of interest in Skye's molecule. They also have a CB1 and maybe. Sam, you can tell us. why their drug was a little bit different from Novo's and kind of what the hope was and then what we saw this week.\n\n00:35:11,190 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, sure. So Sky Biosciences is not one that really shows up very often when people talk about obesity, but I always found their idea interesting. As we know, CB1 is an old, new mechanism, right? It's something that has been postulated before for a while, but of course, as you rightly said, you get these issues with your psychiatric problems when you've got an oral drug that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. So here they thought, maybe we can deal with this by using an antibody, which shouldn't distribute as much as we well know from the Alzheimer's world. They all need a brain shuttle to try and get that concentration up with anti-amyloid antibodies. So here. They're trying to just use a standard antibody, Nimacimab, that binds CB1, and should be peripherally restricted, essentially. And so they did a single-agent phase 2, a phase 2a, 26-week data, and the weight loss underwhelmed.\n\n00:36:12,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n So what's the way forward for this? Weight loss underwhelmed, maybe it's because it's not dosed sufficiently, and it is a bit complicated to dose this. What's the way forward? They suggest there's one way of combining the semaglutide. And of course, when they combine the semaglutide, they show better efficacy than the semaglutide alone arm. And that's something that they're going to focus on and possibly increase the concentration that you deliver. Now, that makes sense. If you put more antibody in the bloodstream, subcutaneous or whatever way you're going to do it, you should get more target engagement. Let's assume that works. The only worry I have is if you increase the dose, are you going to get some sufficient penetration in the brain that might cause these neuropsychiatric side effects? They've seen none with the drug so far at the doses that we've seen. Maybe the future for this is a combination with semaglutide. And of course, you're dealing with a completely different mechanism, so you don't keep getting additional nausea and vomiting, etc.\n\n00:37:15,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n What really, where this really fits in the future, et cetera, who knows? But there is some logic to the approach, which I've always liked the idea of. And we're going to have to see how this data reads out. And we do have some more data coming in. Q1 26 when they report the phase 2a extension study.\n\n00:37:38,800 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's it.\n\n00:37:39,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n Great, great. Thank you. Thank you for sharing. So I think you know open, open questions on that on that mechanism and we'll really need to see positive clinical data that shows really competitive weight loss for there to be renewed enthusiasm in that mechanism. Many other you know mechanisms for obesity that should be reading out over the coming months, which I think, you know, quite a bit on the heavy side. Let's go over to muscle. And Brian, I think maybe if we could have you comment on Dynes data in DM1, as well as the World Muscle Society and DMD presentations.\n\n00:38:23,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, thanks. So yeah, the World Muscle Society is ongoing as we speak.

So yeah, the World Muscle Society is ongoing as we speak. I think they had the late break sessions just earlier this morning, but a lot of data out of here.\n\n00:38:34,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think, you know, Dine is one of the names I cover with some updated data in their DM1 phase two study that I think is interesting. Of course, there's a lot of discussion around Sarepta, Regenexx, and the DMD gene therapy space, all being addressed to some extent at World Muscle Society. So maybe just kind of start on the Dine story. This name has sort of been a little bit of a hot-button topic.\n\n00:39:02,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n In competition with Avidity for reasonably similar DM1 programs, Avidity is ahead with a bigger program dying. um is looking at a smaller pivotal path um but you know there's something that that maybe next year both of them are going to be reviewed at the same time, pending positive results. So Dine had pretty extensive one-year data from their phase one to, particularly, with their pivotal dose this week. And, you know, what I would say kind of looks impressive about it is, you know, almost across the board in their slides, they're showing continued improvement. You know, V-Hot is sort of the main endpoint that. The companies are looking at right here, which is a time of, you know, how quickly it takes to open your fingers. And, you know, it's a little bit better. At 12 months than it was at six months, which was better than placebo in this study.\n\n00:40:04,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n But then when we start looking across a bunch of the other time function tests. You see a little more improvement from six months to 12 months, which I think kind of reinforces the mechanism here and that you're seeing. Continued improvement, not just sort of a stabilization of disease or an initial improvement, but continuing to improve. I was most impressed by the quantitative muscle test. Total score, which basically from six months to twelve months, doubled in the effect size. So, really, showing kind of a pretty nice curve up and to the right. In terms of benefit here, um, so you know, they're enrolling this pivotal cohort right now uh in DM1, and you know, hopefully we'll see that data um around the middle of next year and should hopefully see a filing after that. Again, obviously, avidity is a little bit ahead of them with a larger study.\n\n00:40:59,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think it's going to be one of these situations where, you know, get two data sets from two different size studies and we'll be comparing things like VHA across trials. And, you know, I think Dine, you know, trades at a pretty significant discount to where Avidity does right now. I think the practicality is they're not that far behind in time— could get on the market in a similar time frame. And I thought that data was interesting. Moving on to sort of the DMD side of things. You know, there's a big run up in Sarepta last week. And, you know, I'd sort of characterize that as, you know, people maybe being less negative. I mean, certainly. Um, haven't seen a big change in terms of sentiment on this name after, uh, the controversies around the gene therapy which have led to, uh, two deaths due to liver toxicity in non-ambulatory patients and then, you know, the back and forth we've seen with the FDA over the summer. You know, since then, things have quieted down a little bit. They have a number of posters showing more long-term data, more three-year data from a number of their studies, more younger kid data showing.\n\n00:42:02,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n Know, what I think is a pretty diminished liver toxicity profile relative to the older patients. There's also, you know, a single-or experience of prophylactic use of sirolimus that's presented at WMS. This is sort of the take that Sarepta has to try to mitigate. The liver tox that's occurring with Olavides. Interestingly enough, this is, you know, Regenexx also has data for their DMD therapy. This is a protocol.","char_start":34349,"char_end":38462,"start_time":"00:38:23","end_time":null}

This is a protocol.\n\n00:42:32,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Serolimus has been part of the prophylactic protocol that Regenexx has been using since the initiation of their studies. And, you know, they also show very diminished liver inflammation as a result of serolimus. So, you know, I think talking to docs was a little bit of a. you know, less of a concern, and maybe more of a hope that Yeah. using a little bit of a different methodology for trying to control this liver inflammation with sorolimus might mitigate some of the effects. And, you know, again, I think a lot of people debate the overall efficacy of Alevitus and the gene therapies in general and how much evidence there is of a true effect. But, you know, I think there is generally a belief among the physicians that there is an effect size here, maybe not something that can easily be quantified. So, if the safety profile can be secured a little bit more, may get back to a point where they can start growing sales again.\n\n00:43:32,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Great. About it.\n\n00:43:34,890 [SPEAKER_4]\n Great. Well, thank you. Thank you, Brian. That's a great overview. I think really important to note because it ties into one of the companies, Brian, that we'll have you talk about next. Is just how important we've seen. We have so many big companies now that are companies that are really founded on RNA technology, right? And you were talking about Dyn, you know, Avidity. You know, these are uh, you know, really important kind of companies in our in our ecosystem on island, obviously. And we've really seen uh, you know, a pretty uh, you know, pretty big transformation this year, and just investor sentiment for Ionis, as, you know, another company with a really rich history in this space. You know, one of the, you know, first companies to really be doing a lot of work on ASOs, you know, together with Alnylam and some others. And their stock price has more than doubled this year.\n\n00:44:37,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, they've had a number of readouts. And I think what we wanted to spend a bit of time talking about, Jeroen, was their Innovation Day, which I believe you attended.\n\n00:44:49,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n Let's hear your thoughts on that.\n\n00:44:51,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. So you know, Lynch lifer, you know, what used to say, 'I'm an overnight success— 25 years in the making.' Well, IONIS is now, I think, becoming an overnight success. And I don't know if that's been 25 years or it's been 30 years at this point.\n\n00:45:08,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n But they really finally got to a point that the pipeline is really productive. It's late stage. They actually have a combination of their own products on the market that are doing well. At this point, they have Spinraza that they get royalties on from Biogen. They have Wainua. Bye. Doing pretty well in polyneuropathy TTR with AstraZeneca with an autoinjector. They took 40% share within a year from a nylon. Alone, they have Tringolza for SHTG, which was approved for FCS, familial countermicronymia syndrome.\n\n00:45:47,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n But much more importantly, to your point, Tess, the stock doubled really on the heels of this SHTG data, severe high triglyceridemia, that is now leading to Wall Street to awaken and realize, 'Oh my God, there's actually a big drug here.' They showed a 72% reduction in triglycerides and an 85% reduction in acute pancreatitis. Literally, mic drop-type data. First time ever you're seeing an acute pancreatitis risk reduction.\n\n00:46:14,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n And they've now launched Onzera, which is an auto-injector every four weeks, every eight weeks with switch data from other prophylactic hereditary angioedema drugs. And they're just getting started. I mean, next year, there's going to be phase three LP little a data with Novartis. There's going to be cardio-transformed data for Wainua, the biggest study ever in TTR cardiomyopathy. There's going to be phase three data from their competitor, Ultragenyx and Angelman syndrome. And of course, they're six months behind. Neither company is getting any credit for that. And then there's going to be BEPI. That's their hepatitis B.","char_start":38162,"char_end":42589,"start_time":"00:42:32","end_time":null}

Three things. One. Guiding to profitability in 2028, peak sales of over 5 billion, 3 billion from their pipeline, 2 billion from collaborators.\n\n00:47:28,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm too.\n\n00:47:30,690 [SPEAKER_0]\n They you know: Not on Ionis was that everything they're doing is cool and all, but there's always somebody behind them who's better with siRNA. Well, they have their own siRNA platform now, and they've unveiled now out of nowhere phase one data.\n\n00:47:47,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n For their A plus C3.\n\n00:47:50,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's their own competitor to their own Tringolza, which is monthly with an ASO. With the siRNA they're getting 90% reduction.\n\n00:48:00,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n Same as the monthly except if you look at the PK, it supports every six months or once annual dosing. So that came out of nowhere and that's going into phase two. and then finally they've rolled a whole new chemistry with an RNA platform now even targeting mass muscle and they're going into half path and and heart failure.\n\n00:48:22,200 [SPEAKER_0]\n So plus, I'd even mentioned a host of other other kinds of smaller drugs, including Alexander disease that just hit in a pivotal, but it's going to be a small drug, but they're launching that probably next year. So bottom line is: used to say I'm dating myself. This is not your grandfather's you know Ultimobile. This is not you know old school leonis. There's actually a lot going on there.\n\n00:48:44,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n All right. Well, thank you, Jeroen. Always exciting to see companies really reinventing themselves and capturing a lot of investor interest and innovation. Um, you know it's amazing to think—um, you know— just going back, winding back a couple of years, right? When Iona said, 'Hey, we're not really going to commercialize our own stuff. Let's like spin that out and uh, you know, really focus on like R&D and kind of like pipeline stuff and doing deals. Now really bringing that back in house and turning themselves into a commercial company that now has many more wholly owned programs. So that's a real shift for the company. Let's move on to some regulatory updates that we got this week. Brian, why don't you kick us off with Lexio?\n\n00:49:36,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes, so Lexio Therapeutics, another gene therapy company, are working in the cardiac space. Their lead program is in cardiomyopathy due to Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n00:49:47,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n LX2006. And, you know, this name, they've gone through a phase one study, a dose finding study in cardiomyopathy FAP. patients. And, you know, I think, you know, we know sort of the history of some of these FAA drugs. And I think a lot of people think of it as sort of a neurological disease. Most of the patients ultimately die of cardiovascular issues. So there's a huge cardiac component to it. And that's really what they're targeting here.\n\n00:50:16,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Of more slanted towards the older side of patients who have more progressive disease. And, you know, FAA is a very interesting disease because it is monogenic.","char_start":42289,"char_end":45979,"start_time":"00:46:53","end_time":null}

And that's really what they're targeting here.\n\n00:50:16,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Of more slanted towards the older side of patients who have more progressive disease. And, you know, FAA is a very interesting disease because it is monogenic.\n\n00:50:27,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Patients have this diminished capability of producing functional frataxin. And this is a frataxin replacement therapy, you know, and they've shown very good ability to increase for taxon expression in cardiac biopsies. It does seem to have a dose relationship across the three doses that they've tested. And, you know, a big question here is around the flexibility of CBER and gene therapy, obviously, and I know we're going to talk about this in a minute. But obviously, the last iteration of the CBER administration, Peter Marks, was extremely flexible, offered a lot of flexibility to gene therapy companies in orphan disease in general. And with sort of the changing of the guard, there's a lot of questions: how much of that flexibility will still be applied, especially given the current head of CBER, who's sort of been very critical of the Peter Marks flexibility. Dynamic. So Lexio offered two updates today, one earlier this week, one regulatory update, as well as providing some additional long-term clinical data from their initial study.\n\n00:51:31,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I would say the overall picture, I thought, looked really positive on the clinical update. side of things, the primary thing that we're looking at here is left ventricular mass volume. This is a measure that's already sort of been blessed by the prior iteration of the FDA in Rockett's Dannen disease case. And, you know, they're sort of utilized. Hopefully, have been relying on sort of the same guidance that was provided to the Dannon program to try to make the case here that statistically significant reductions in LVMI that would be 10% or greater over a certain time period would be an approval endpoint on a surrogate endpoint. The FDA had already sort of said yes to this earlier in the year. They had an additional meeting and announced that.\n\n00:52:25,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n LVMI would not just continue to be one of the co-primary endpoints in a pivotal study, in addition to for taxon expression. But they also also offered hints that, you know. The flexibility was even leaning maybe a little more flexible than we had previously expected. The FDA is apparently letting them pull data from their phase one, two, and the planned pivotal study so that you know this could potentially lower the overall sample size from the pivotal study that they're planning to to start in the first half of 20 to 26. So this, you know, offering some statistical flexibility that, you know, we don't normally see— sort of the pooling of data across two clinical studies for a primary analysis. And the other thing is, I think everyone expected really that the timeframe for LVMI measurement would be at 12 months. And, you know, while they haven't specified what the actual timeframe for LVMI measurement is going to wind up being, they said that it's probably going to be less than 12 months— that the FDA is offering an earlier time. timeframe for analysis.\n\n00:53:27,000 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, when you look across the LVMI data that they've seen so far in patients who are, you know, have impaired baseline LVMI, they are crossing that threshold of 10% pretty rapidly by six months. So, you know, this might wind up being an evaluation period that is, you know, almost half of what was expected. The sample size coming down that will certainly allow them to run a more rapid pivotal study, but I think overall, just kind of in my view and certainly for me, it gives me a little more encouragement that you know, CBER isn't really moving into a much, much more conservative methodology for evaluating gene therapies. Orphan diseases and is continuing to, you know, if not totally carry on in the Peter Marks tradition, is at least still offering a high level of flexibility for these diseases that are really, you know, major unmet medical needs with not a lot of options for patients.\n\n00:54:26,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n Great.\n\n00:54:28,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n Great. Well, thank you. Thank you, Brian. Certainly encouraging.\n\n00:54:33,460 [SPEAKER_4]\n And you mentioned Peter Marks.

Adam was saying on the podcast they do that he feels he's a disruptor and that would be so much more fun for him. Which, of course, it wouldn't be.\n\n00:54:57,439 [SPEAKER_3]\n Look, it's not going to be helpful, is it? At the end of the day, an FDA regulator that.\n\n00:55:04,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n Was potentially a little bit controversial, did go to a pharma company, Eli Lilly in this case.\n\n00:55:11,980 [SPEAKER_3]\n What is he going to be doing there? Who wants to take that? The title doesn't really tell us much.\n\n00:55:19,379 [SPEAKER_3]\n But it's, I mean, you know, I can't, I don't want to sit here and criticize people who come out of a job where they were essentially, I don't know, do you want to call it 'pushed out'? Um, uh. To take a job to carry on doing what they believe is is value added for the future of drug development, but it's just not very very helpful for the cause at the minute.\n\n00:55:47,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's all I can say to be honest with you.\n\n00:55:51,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can I show you? Please. So I'm going to take the other side. Yeah, I will definitely take the other side here.\n\n00:56:00,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n He has unbelievable skill set that is going to be put to use in a very valuable company. And he's by far not the first one in any industry or from any government job to then go into industry. And we see this over and over again: people coming into. um, on the finance side, people go into consulting firms, people become lobbyists, and this is just a natural extension of sort of what's next. I don't know that look. He's got to work. Presumably, going to be an academician. I don't know. Is really where his skill set necessarily is. His skill set is in drug development. And if you think about doing good for humanity and for patients, it's a perfect role.\n\n00:56:44,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n I honestly don't. I remember back in the days, there used to be, if you left medicine and you went into industry, it was like sacrilegious. Think over time, people realize that an ecosystem is built of many partners and this is a great example. I think he's going to do amazing work next and I'm very happy he's doing that. As opposed to just you know, I agree with you.\n\n00:57:04,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n I didn't want it for a moment. Sound that was critical of him. So just to be clear about that, it's just: What are you going to do? It's not going to look great. And the folks who want to use this as an example of the, what's it called? The swinging door or I can't remember now, revolving door are going to use it. But, you know, again, as you rightly say, he's got a lot to offer and he's gone somewhere where he can do it. So great.\n\n00:57:31,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. and I didn't mean to. I wasn't coming. You can come at me anytime you like.\n\n00:57:38,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n No but it's more of a this is a broader conversation about you know what's what. Should the public maybe expect? Look there's always going to be naysayers. There's always going to be critics. Right it's very easy to be a Monday morning quarterback. And I I you know I'm guilty of that. I scream at the TV as my kids tell me. You know they can't hear you but you know at the end of the day. Um look. I think that our The average person, I think, maybe need to not be so critical.\n\n00:58:08,330 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just before you wrap up, I think we need to stay on for another five hours because apparently AstraZeneca is going to announce its deal with the administration.\n\n00:58:20,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n My goodness. Okay. Well, everyone who wants to stay on until, you know, six o'clock, you're welcome to.\n\n00:58:27,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n But I think this I think this point is a really important one around like.

Yes, you can talk about revolving door and certainly I think it's important that you don't have.\n\n00:58:37,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, that you don't have people making decisions in regulatory positions where they're like favoring a company because of like a certain economics or a certain relationship. But like. What are ways to resolve that? Like disclosure is one and, you know, recusing yourself from like certain decisions are others, right? Like we have so many ways of managing conflicts of interest. I think what's much worse for our sector is if like. People are talking to each other and we're not getting expert opinions on the right things. Right. I mean. How much are you really going to learn from an advisory committee related to, say, a multiple myeloma drug where you can't find a multiple myeloma expert who—uh, you know, maybe hasn't been involved in a trial— um that has involved some kind of like industry compounds. So I think that. Thinking about the mechanisms to manage those conflicts is way more important than just saying, 'My gosh, there shall be no connectivity or discussion.\n\n00:59:37,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Or knowledge of what the other people are doing.' I mean, that really leads to suboptimal decisions.\n\n00:59:46,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I think we will. I think we will leave it at that. Just, you know, exciting, you know, exciting week for continued interest in biopharma, both from strategics, from investors, and a lot of fundamental progress that supports that. And thank you so much, Brian and Yaron and Luba and Sam for sharing your perspectives. See everyone next week.","char_start":53701,"char_end":55510,"start_time":"00:58:27","end_time":null}

I'm Paul Matisse, and my co-hosts today are John Maragonore, Eric Schmidt, and Greg Sivanovich. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. So with that, always good to kick it off with the discussion around sentiment. And I feel like. we had an incredible streak, at least with Eric and I in the show a while ago, where just every week we were just lamenting how much of a bummer it is. But it feels like the XBI has been strong, and I'm sure we all get asked by people like, 'Do you think this is sustainable?' And outside of certain factors, there's always the same kind of risks out there, right? Still, some noise around drug pricing, but to me— it feels like we're seeing a bunch of tailwinds, right? More M&A, good stock reactions on positive data. We've talked about smaller, mid-sized companies that are successfully launching drugs.\n\n00:01:01,640 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's noise about interest rates coming down. I mean, the list goes on. So I guess not just— we can all talk about the factors, but I think it would be good to just maybe even hear— and maybe, Greg, you can start, and then we can go around the horn. Like, how do we feel about this market and how sustainable this market is going to be over the next six to 12 months?\n\n00:01:21,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks.\n\n00:01:23,440 [SPEAKER_0]\n Paul thanks for having me. Um, you know, it's been really interesting to see— particularly as I've been able to do marketing meetings, which for those of you who are on this podcast for sell-side analysts. When we go marketing, we travel throughout the country to visit with buy-side investors to get a sense of what they're interested in and in the past. Two, three weeks, I've been able to market in Boston, in Dallas, and I'm actually doing this podcast from San Francisco right now, but I was visiting with investors in San Diego and even LA, and yes, there are some in LA, but that being said, it does of course, seem that. sentiment in biotech is very positive right now. I think it's caught a lot of people by surprise. Certainly, if you look at the stock charts and as as imperfect as the XBI may be as a proxy for sentiment. I think there's also another ETF that's relatively new to me that someone pointed out. It's called the BBC.\n\n00:02:24,110 [SPEAKER_0]\n But we're talking about, you know, in the past six months, 40 plus percent, um, performance for at least the XBI, and it's even closer to 80 for this BBC ETF, which tracks more early clinical stage companies. And so it's been happening, and clearly it came off of the lows. Uh, six months ago, of um, you know, the tariff announcements by the current administration, so um, obviously, the comp is quite easy. Uh, but it really feels me that in the past month or so, it just feels very very tangible people are asking, you know, what has changed, if anything has changed, and I do think that sets up an interesting conversation we could have in terms of has anything really fundamentally changed um, but certainly, like macro things, as Paul pointed out um, earlier with regards to uncertainty earlier in the year with respect to Washington DC policy and their approach to health care, whether it was RFK Jr. and what he might have brought forth, changes at FDA.\n\n00:03:31,680 [SPEAKER_0]\n and obviously, given noise around potential forcing of lower prices for the pharmaceutical industry. But I think where we are today, is that it's not really as bad as people think. There's still the uncertainty of every day and what may come out of Washington, D. C., but I think from an investor perspective, worst case fears have not materialized. We do have positive data sets that are being reported. Stocks are moving up higher. Smaller companies are able to raise significant amounts of capital, and you do see follow-through. performance. We've got an administration that's generally trying to lower interest rates, which I think for the narrative is good. for the biotech sector. So I think there are lots of different factors. Now, how sustainable this is, I think that is the key question, and we're always trying to figure that out.","char_start":0,"char_end":4370,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

This is now the second straight week of positive net. fund flows into the sector, which we haven't had that in quite a while. And I do think the sentiment. Um is getting stronger, I think. It's probably driven by the interest rate cuts that we saw, and expectations for more. And then sort of the numbing of the Washington policy risks and environment, and obviously the continued drumbeat of M&A. So it's all coming together, I think, in a way that's good. And I do think it'll be sustainable, maybe more gradual over time, but it is going to be a sustainable recovery. And it's been a long time— a super long time. It's been a very cold winter; I know.\n\n00:05:56,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n I feel like 2021 to just a couple of months ago. Eric, what do you think about the sustainability of this? And maybe you can also comment on just the regulatory environment biotech right now and how much of an opportunity or risk is that for the run? Because you and I have talked about— on the one hand. how the FDA is communicating a lot of sort of rosy, flexible, sweetheart deals to a number of companies, but on the other hand, you've been dealing with this scholar rock situation, and we've seen other sort of signs of maybe reduced FDA productivity. I mean, let's hear your overall thoughts, but I love your perspective there.\n\n00:06:30,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, thanks for that, Paul. And I loved how Greg set up this discussion. I think he did it extremely eloquently in terms of, okay, what's going on out there? Yes, he's right. John, you're right too. There's no doubt there's an influx of funding coming in. Paul, you and I were on the hangout a couple of weeks ago. We talked about really back then for the first time. getting a few calls or maybe now starting to get more calls from generalists. And that's certainly continued for the last two or three weeks. There's a deluge of interest right now from folks that we really hadn't talked to. for months or years into the past.\n\n00:07:05,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, that's the driver for why the XBI has outperformed. I think the XBI has now outperformed the S &P 500 by a whopping 17% since the beginning of September. That is a. crazy amount of outperformance relative to the broader index in a very short period of time.\n\n00:07:23,440 [SPEAKER_3]\n So that can only be one thing, money coming into the sector, as John mentioned. We should enjoy it less. It's been a long time. I do think that biotech was oversold. I do think that we were being punished for reasons that we had, you know, maybe no, no deserving to be punished for, but, but But then the question is, well, what what really has changed? And honestly, I. I'm not sure that things have changed that much. I don't think they were ever as bad as folks thought back in March or April, and maybe we need to be a little bit careful that today, they're not quite as good as the stock performance might have, you think.

We know that, coming off of the the Tylenol and Luke of Warren] debacle of a few weeks ago. We've still seen some. I don't know, misadventures with regard to the FDA being able to get its work done on time, not just not just. inspecting facilities but but also pushing out the doofidates here and there. People have brushed some of this stuff under the cover, under the rug, but I think it's quite real. And then, actually, Stat News did a nice piece earlier in the week this week just on. you know, how the environment in terms of the culture.\n\n00:08:47,420 [SPEAKER_3]\n and organizational abilities. The FDA still seems to be under distress. I guess they were noting the Luke of Warren approval in particular and talking about how that had come. Top down from the agency press to the review staff.\n\n00:09:02,630 [SPEAKER_3]\n And you can imagine it was kind of forced upon the agency in a way that. Ruffled some feathers. So I think we need to be careful.\n\n00:09:11,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n A lot of great innovation going on out there, but our government may not be operating under the best of efficiencies right now. Um, that would be my thought, but I'd love to hear your thoughts, Paul.\n\n00:09:23,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, I mean, I hate like, I think in general, as long as these concessions we're seeing from some of the leading therapeutics companies really in the pharma space. Thank you. As long as the ways that they are— for lack of a better term, kind of kissing the ring a bit— right, to the Trump administration and moving manufacturing, as long as that can kind of stave off the worst case scenario of true.\n\n00:09:46,349 [SPEAKER_1]\n Tangible M&F or some sort of other policy that's going to impact like a broader array of companies. I feel like the sector's in an okay spot, right, because it's M&A continues to seem inevitable, right? So, like, I think that's going to be there, right, to maybe buoy things or kind of raise the floor. So I'm feeling okay, you know, I think. And look, you know, I mean. Maybe COVID is not the right sort of benchmark to think about whether or not the XBI is quote unquote expensive, because that was a little crazy, but we're so, so, so far from that still. So does anyone want to kind of comment on how they think about the IPO market? I'm going to kind of step aside from this conversation just because, you know, there's a but. Anyone else want to kind of chime in there on the IPOs or do we want to go to news?\n\n00:10:33,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I'm happy to comment. And it comes from the perspective of recently visiting with some private biotech companies, and particularly some that are later stage in their cycle. And by that, I mean they're either running a phase two or phase three program with prospects of data coming out, you know, sometime over the next 12 months. And in speaking with them, one in particular was just out. They had an update.\n\n00:11:08,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Where they wanted to go out to their existing investors. And so they visited with their investors in Boston and New York and in the Baltimore area. and um i think the view uh is that um people feel good about where we are um clearly we're at the end of the year and with the end of the year that means we've got the um you know big party of JP Morgan Healthcare Conference just a few months away. and i think, you know, with this year, we've seen a few issues, you know. filing i think map light um filed recently i think you know lb pharma went out uh and had a decent uh ipo but i do think that in speaking not only with private companies and what they're hearing from investors, but also with friends that I have in healthcare banking, and also contacts that I've spoken with who are working at the law firm. there is a lot of excitement. there is a lot of activity happening. i do think that we are looking at a potential new.","char_start":7717,"char_end":11949,"start_time":"00:08:07","end_time":null}

I'm not an investment banker, so I'm not the smartest to be talking about these things necessarily. But based on what I'm hearing and given where we are, particularly when looking at the XBI, for example, I do think there is lots of positive energy right now in terms of where people feel about the IPO window for biotech opening up again.\n\n00:12:40,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, the other thing I'd just add on, oh, sorry, John, go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead, Eric. Um, The quality of private companies that we're seeing is extremely high. Uh, these companies have not had an opportunity to go public for now several years, and and honestly, the best ones don't want to test the water— they don't want to be first to put a toe in. So they've been waiting very peacefully, building, creating, innovating. And um, I can't believe how many wonderful companies we're meeting with— you know, week in week out. These days, because yes, they are, as Greg says, all sort of gearing up and thinking about going public. And it's going to be an amazing crop of companies. It may be one of the best quality years we ever see in 2026. At least I am hopeful that. Know these inflows continue, and the XBI continues to move in the positive direction. And we could see a very, very great year for IPOs. So from my lips to God's ears.\n\n00:13:40,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's really the point I was going to jump in on, Eric. So thanks for. Thanks for starting that side of it. I do think the consequence of a very long, dark um winter here for biotech. And the private side means that the companies that have made it through to this point are by far.\n\n00:14:06,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Road tested and stronger than what you normally would see, and they're also more mature because they've had to stay private longer. So they're not coming out with you know pre-clinical ideas, but they're coming out with you know phase two, phase three, um, uh, programs with with strong proof of concept and you know very very promising therapeutic areas, um, with real differentiation. So I I do think the vintage 2026 IPOs is going to be.\n\n00:14:38,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n About as good as it gets in.\n\n00:14:41,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n In in winemaking of biotech companies and I think we should all be Excited about that, because it will. Create hopefully a more um a more solid foundation for the years to come as as more companies mature and get ready to go public.\n\n00:15:03,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n Makes sense. All right. Glass half full. John, do you want to?\n\n00:15:08,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n Comment on the CNPV decisions.\n\n00:15:12,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n What do you think of the list? Any patterns you're noticing here? And how do you see the implications?\n\n00:15:19,089 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, thanks. I mean, look, I'm— you know, the CMPV program was introduced earlier this year by Commissioner Mackery, and I think there was some at the time there was some mixed feelings about it. I think there was, you know, Adam Forestein had a very negative feeling about it, as I recall, maybe it was Matt Herper, I'm not sure which one, but they they worried about it being very political, very driven by sort of the whims of RFK, if you will, or other driven.","char_start":11649,"char_end":15245,"start_time":"00:12:10","end_time":null}

And the whole thing, you know, I for one felt, hey, this is great— we need more accelerated approval pathways, we need more ways of recognizing the ape of innovation, and getting these drugs to patients faster. So, you know, I've always been positive, constructively positive about the program. In principle. And I was delighted to see the list come out yesterday. There were nine approvals— or nine programs— that were put into the. into the bucket of some of the CNPBs. And just a reminder, I mean, the CNPB program is aiming to get reviews. NDA or BLA reviews within one to two months of submission. So a pretty remarkable acceleration of, you know, getting a drug approved. Compared to the normal, you know, nine to 12 months, if you're lucky, type of process. So I think this really is, this is good. Now, the list of nine drugs, I had a couple of observations.\n\n00:16:56,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n One is, there were definitely some very innovative, highly, highly innovative drugs that, you know, I think anybody, any one of us would say, you know, should get recognized and should get this nomination, the D. B. Otto.\n\n00:17:19,980 [SPEAKER_2]\n Off hereditary deafness is one of them. Bit of pertin— which is the um disc drug for erythropoietic protoporphyria and then the other notable one to me was the the Revolution Medicine RM-6236 RAS drug for pancreatic cancer. I mean, those three are drugs I know about and have high regard for. For the science and what's behind them. Then the other part of the list, which was quite curious, quite interesting, but it makes sense, was that there were Augmentin for a U. S. manufacturing supply and Ketamine for a U. S. manufacturing supply. I mean, two, you know, or drugs and and and patient care that and for hospital needs that, you know, are subject to shortages and clearly are reliant upon ex-U.\n\n00:18:21,816 [SPEAKER_2]\n S. manufacturing. So that was interesting. So it was a bit of a mix, I would say. As much as I love the innovative products. I don't know how they really fit in what we read about the mandate of this program when it was first initiated of being somehow involved in the national interest.\n\n00:18:40,469 [SPEAKER_2]\n Security interests of the country.\n\n00:18:43,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's sort of hard to make that case for these, but they are really, really innovative drugs. So my net on this is it's good. I would like to understand the process a little bit better and the criteria.\n\n00:18:55,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n Have companies in my landscape that have thought about this program but it's unclear to most of them, if not all of them, as to what really merits you know, consideration under the program. So I do think and hope that there's more transparency around the process from FDA on this program going forward. Look, I'm happy with the list. I'm happy to see these things happening. I'm happy to see drugs get to patients faster. That's what matters at the end of the day. And sure, I'm sure. There's reasons to be critical of anything, but this is a net positive. And I was also good to see some of the market reaction of these products and the companies that had them, which is what we've seen historically with breakthrough therapy designation as well. So I'll pause there and see if anybody wants to add anything to it as well.\n\n00:19:46,040 [SPEAKER_3]\n What a great introduction. John, I think that.\n\n00:19:50,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, we too are hopeful, right? We have to be hopeful and shorter review times, as you say, can't be a bad thing. I do think a little bit of the proof is in the pudding here, right? We are not quite sure that the FDA is going to be able to hit this one or two-month review cycle and that they'll make the right decisions coming out of that review cycle.\n\n00:20:10,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n This is a good start. It also sounds like there's another tranche coming. Dr. Macari was very, very clear that even within weeks we could see a whole new second tranche.","char_start":14945,"char_end":19246,"start_time":"00:15:52","end_time":null}

We could use a little bit more transparency to the process, but the more the merrier here if he continues to choose reasonable things. This is one drug on this list that caught my attention, teplizumab from Sanofi, which actually failed, I think, in a trial. So I was scratching my head on that one. I guess that was kind of the oddball to me. And then there was also a very interesting comment. I'm sure you picked up on this too. Dr. Macquarie when he was referencing the Regeneron Deviato for deafness, the gene therapy said it. It could be priced at a very, very low price point or even given away for free.\n\n00:20:56,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n So that had to catch all of our attention. If pricing is part and parcel or part of the bargain here.\n\n00:21:04,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, that's just something to consider that you're paying to play.\n\n00:21:08,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n And that you may not be able to get the return on your innovation that you otherwise might. Len has always been interested in fair drug pricing, going back to, I think, is Roy Vagelos' days. Of how this industry ought to be. Um, very citizen-minded in its approach, but we'll see if maybe that product made the list because of a very low price point that they aim to provide the drug at.\n\n00:21:34,530 [SPEAKER_2]\n I guess one other thing to consider, Eric, is we'll have to see over time if there's a view on how these— products with this rapid approval— are viewed, either from the standpoint of public trust around their safety and efficacy, and then we'll also have to see over time how programs that are reviewed on this already, you know, review voucher program are viewed from a payer perspective as well. I'm going to stay optimistic on those two for now, but, you know, that is something which we'll have to see with how this evolves.\n\n00:22:14,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Great, great points.\n\n00:22:17,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, well, let's. Uh, I need go ahead. I was going to say I need to get much smarter around uh this new program.\n\n00:22:28,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I'm just curious for those who. do know a lot more than I do.\n\n00:22:33,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n Kind of the process, and you know. Um, clearly, we had the list that came out last night. But I've, I've, don't have any good visibility or knowledge as to how many other applications are in, and kind of, if you're a company and you apply for this, do you get a rejection as well? Do you know the status of what happens, or is it, there another batch of drugs that will be added to this list at some point in the future? I think, for companies in particular, as this is all relatively new for many of us, it'd be interesting how this all plays out.\n\n00:23:12,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, my sense greg is that, and you know what—I have one company I cover that I probably should hit them up today and say, 'Hey, did you get a rejection or not? Right, because I'm pretty sure applied, but I've heard anecdotally, I don't know if others have heard anything differently. That companies who applied for this were, you know, a little bit in the dark. Um, I think there were well over a hundred applications. I don't know if there's a more up-to-date number, but there were a lot who applied. I think that there's still There's still a question around for certain types of drugs, what this means as it relates to, I guess, like regulatory de-risking broadly, right? Like, if you are a company, and you think you could be ready to file for approval, but that's not 100% certain with at the division level, and then you get a CMP. Is that an endorsement that, hey, this now does look approvable? And, you know, I can think of a couple of scenarios of that as well. So, I mean, to me, I'm like still it feels like it's going to be very like a specific and how you interpret this.\n\n00:24:14,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n Does anyone does anyone know how this is communicated to other companies who didn't get chosen?","char_start":18946,"char_end":23200,"start_time":"00:20:10","end_time":null}

Um and and you know I think you're but I think you're right. There are well over 100 applications that that went in for this program. But there was a lot of uncertainty around what the standards and criteria are.\n\n00:24:37,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n So let's see how it is. Maybe we're going to sort of experientially get to the right type of guidelines and approaches here as things get selected. But more to come, I'm sure.\n\n00:24:50,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, because just as a quick follow-up, I cover a few companies that have seen the remarkable success of Revolution Medicines. And certainly, if you look at the stock, you look at the market cap, clearly, you know. Uh, well liked by investors, but you know I cover a few smaller companies—uminus than 500 million market cap range— that are trying to do like a fast follower approach. And I'm. Curious as to whether, because revolution medicines for their 6236 program now have this, if they automatically are not eligible to pursue the same thing, like there's just lots of questions which, um, it'll be very fascinating to see how this all develops.\n\n00:25:37,460 [SPEAKER_3]\n And again, I don't want to be the glass half empty guy, but the other consideration is with all the resources going into potentially supporting.\n\n00:25:45,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n Rapid approvals for this list of nine programs. Presumably, another list of some odd number of programs coming, I think Dr. Macari said within the next weeks. We just hope that the FDA has the resources to keep its eye on the ball with regard to standard review applications. We know, again, that there are some chinks in the armor here, and the FDA isn't necessarily operating at 60 miles an hour.\n\n00:26:10,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n To that potential pace. I hope that we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul in any way with regard to the resources.\n\n00:26:19,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n Very important. Very important point, Eric.\n\n00:26:22,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n Thank you. Absolutely. Um. Eric, do you want to talk about the GLP-1 pricing comments that came out of the White House? And I think, you know, more broadly, what are you saying to investors around drug pricing risk for the sector right now? Like, I guess the way what I'm saying, and you tell me if you disagree, is like. I think for the most part, it feels okay. I don't think rhetoric ever goes away on the margin. But you know, I kind of agree with the consensus view that some sort of broader MFN selecting a bunch of drugs. I'm just— I'm not losing sleep over that, but I am, you know, ready for any given tweet at any given time that can move a move a stock or two. But what's your perspective on this? Glyph one stuff and just kind of where you think we're going on the pricing?\n\n00:27:12,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah. I generally agree with you, Paul. I think what you said was well said. I mean, first, we should just recap, since this program was recorded earlier in the day on Friday.\n\n00:27:22,000 [SPEAKER_3]\n Last Friday, we had the second announcement of an MFN deal between AstraZeneca and the White House. That seemed pretty straightforward and boilerplate, right? So that wasn't, maybe, nearly as surprising or innovative in the wake of. Pfizer, a couple of weeks earlier. But certainly, it gives you a pretty good roadmap for what's likely to happen for. You know, future pharmaceutical companies, as they come and and cut their deal, and hopefully, it doesn't seem like it's particularly costly in terms of the drug pricing hits that these companies are going to take. So I would be encouraged by the track record we've seen thus far. And then, you're right. Just last night, we had kind of another wacky tweet come out from the White House. It was kind of immediately almost. Corrected or rephrased by Dr. Oz, who said, 'No, President Trump doesn't really mean that we're going to bring down the price of these GLP-1s.' $150 out of pocket, they may come out a little bit higher than that. I guess we'll all wait for Lilly and for Novo to cut their own deals with the White House and see where this comes. 'Um'","char_start":22900,"char_end":27291,"start_time":"00:24:14","end_time":null}

'Um'\n\n00:28:28,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n but my guess is, if these pharma companies with all their sophistication and financial planning and analysis powers—if they're cutting a deal with the government, it's probably going to be an okay deal economically for them. Of course, a lot has been made for the fact that Pfizer hasn't had to restate guidance or or refile with any SEC.\n\n00:28:50,379 [SPEAKER_3]\n paperwork, any changes to its financial condition in the wake of its deal with the White House. So yeah, I'm with you. I think that we can live with what seems to be happening. I don't think it's the end of the day by any means or the end of the road for drug pricing discussions, right? This unfortunately. It's going to be a tense, tense topic for. probably as long as all of us are alive. And, John, I'm very interested in your views on just that. If I could chime in real quick.\n\n00:29:18,520 [SPEAKER_2]\n I would just hate to have the kneecaps of one of the pharma CEOs right now. That's all I could say.\n\n00:29:25,980 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I think, like, the interesting thing that we've seen with these deals is companies are benefiting, in my opinion, from the opacity around the true cost of a drug, right? I can't say I've done the math on everything, but just some— these deals where it's okay this drug's going to be sold directly to consumer or through TruRx for this discount. I mean, you look at it and just you're like, 'In your at least me i'm in my head, I'm like, 'I wonder how different that is really to the gross net,' right? So, I mean, these companies are smart, you know, and I think there's a dynamic. Dynamic with this so far that is not that dissimilar to the dynamic with the IRA where there's a a sticker price cut, number or a political price cut number, and then there's the true underlying impact to the business, which I'm sure there's a drug or two that's gone so far gone through this, where like an estimate might be need to be re-rated. But just generally speaking, these deals feel very benign to me. John, do you have anything to add?\n\n00:30:23,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, I do think that they've been cushioned in their design by the pharma companies to— mitigate any meaningful impact on the business. And I think it is. I think you're exactly right, Paul. It's all— it's all sort of caught in the sausage making between. gross to net, and discounts, and rebates, and the whole nine yards. And so I think the net impact is really quite small of what we've seen so far. So that's good, because I think it means that the innovation will get rewarded, and maybe the things that get less rewarded are the middlemen who you might get squeezed out of something so that's good.\n\n00:31:12,070 [SPEAKER_1]\n Makes sense. So maybe we'll talk about some news. You know, I thought an interesting deal this week was the Biochrist acquisitions of Astrea therapeutics. And it was an interesting deal on a few levels. One, you know, I mean, this Biochrist is not that big of a company, right? So to do a deal that is for the better part of a billion. I mean, that's a pretty significant acquisition for a small company. Two, it's consolidation of two players in the HEE space. Biochrist has a product for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks. These are these intermittent swelling attacks. Astrea was developing another product for attack prevention that's sort of a next-generation version of TacZyro.","char_start":26991,"char_end":30715,"start_time":"00:28:28","end_time":null}

Astrea was developing another product for attack prevention that's sort of a next-generation version of TacZyro.\n\n00:31:53,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n And so, just the therapeutic area overlap there, I mean, to me, it feels like a fairly smart deal. Right, a biocrist stock reaction was not was not initially positive, but just in general, I mean, I think one thing I thought about, for I cover Cal Vista and just kind of, you know, have covered a number of smaller, size, rare disease companies in the past where, you know, investors are looking at market opportunities that are in the hundreds of millions, not the billions. I do think it's hard for small companies sometimes to get full credit for an asset that might not meet that critical mass for some investors. I think sometimes in small-cap biotech, investors can be blockbuster hunters and they're less interested in a company that might trade at an attractive multiple of something that is, kind of, in the sub 500 million range. And so, you know, I wonder if we'll see more of this. There's also the FTC question, right? Because these companies are directly overlapping, but.\n\n00:32:48,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I mean, this FTC seems like it's, you know, not a hot take, right? Far, far less strict than its predecessor. So wondering if anyone else had any views on this deal or just, you know, what do you think about small companies doing BD like this? I mean, it's not common. It's not common at all.\n\n00:33:08,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I love this deal, Paul, for the reasons you said, right? This is a company in biogas and knows exactly what it's buying and how it's going to fit in the market. So companies sticking to their knitting and. Doubling down on indication, getting stronger. That's what M&A should be about. And the only potential concern might be, as you said, the FTC. I had the same thought you had. Maybe because there are just so many new players in this HAE space, it's much more unlikely that we see any one transaction trigger the attention. And you're right, the political environment is more favorable here. Hats off to both companies. I know Astra used to be a database system has been surviving for months. 15, 20 years now. They finally had their little exit and congrats to Jill Mellon and her team.\n\n00:33:56,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that's a throwback catabasis.\n\n00:33:59,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I feel like in the HEE space, it's become.\n\n00:34:02,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's become crowded enough that it can be, I mean, it varies company to company, stock to stock, but I think it's hard for individual companies in this area to get full credit for what they're doing because of the theoretical uncertainty around what the five-year competition outlook looks like. And I know Calvista so far has had a promising first quarter of their launch in the acute space, but they're still, to some investors, a show-me story.\n\n00:34:28,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, if anyone else wants to comment here, please feel free.

Um, I do think that you know, given the capital needs of all of these companies, like it's going to be very difficult for every company to raise the financing that they need to be able to you know advance their program. So I do think that, while you know, potentially, on one level, if one company is no longer able to stand alone on its own and it merges or gets acquired by another company, but I do think, in the bigger picture, it is quite healthy for the industry. Right? Clearly, we all talk about, you know, the let's call it excesses of 2020 2021 in terms of how many companies came out as as new public entities and whether they were ready for prime time. And you know, we made a comment earlier about how. And I would agree, we feel that the 2026 class and hopefully, there is a very nice class of new IPOs are likely to be very high quality names. But I do think that this.\n\n00:35:54,819 [SPEAKER_0]\n natural evolution of our biotech industry, even though there it could involve job losses, which we don't like to see, but I think it's very healthy and I, you know, I like seeing deals that are strategic and hopefully not deals that are just what we used to see in large-cap pharma. I think way back when in the 2000s, I always felt that it was almost like, you know. To struggling companies that simply decided to merge and there was lots of synergies that you could ring out and hopefully. Um, putting two ugly companies together made one somewhat prettier company, and I don't know if that ever really worked out. But I think, here, that relates to biotech. Um, I hope we do see a lot more M&A in the space.\n\n00:36:39,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n Makes sense.\n\n00:36:41,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n Eric, do you want to run through some news in your space?\n\n00:36:45,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh, yeah, it sounds like you're giving me my my pick of the litter. So thank you for that. Paul, I thought maybe we'll start with the Scholar Rock. Regeneron news is it sort of more broadly impacts a few companies, and of these companies, of course, is up in your and John's neck of the woods in Boston. Scholar Rock company that I'm close to. I think for those who missed the news, this company and Regeneron are sort of cuddled together in terms of being derailed and delayed and approval of new drugs due to a fill finish. Plant that's now owned by Novo. It used to be owned by Catalent and that plant got what's called an OAI letter earlier in the week. And that means that in order for the plant to regain compliance, it's going to need to go through a re-inspection and that re-inspection is almost certainly going to take some time— number of months— before you can schedule and then complete and then validate the re-inspection and re-compliance. The end. Net result of all this is that patients are waiting for drugs.\n\n00:37:47,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, you know, in particular in Scholar Rock's case, they're waiting for I would say a very important drug for patients, younger patients, children with SMA, spinal muscular atrophy, a terribly debilitating genetic disease.\n\n00:38:02,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n And this is really unfortunate. Maybe in Regeneron's case, we don't need a necessarily need to the degree that we need sclerox apotegramab. Maybe we don't need another. Know high dose formulation of ilea, but But the fact that we are waiting around for a number of months, maybe even longer than that, in order to get approval for a drug that you know, has passed all other requirements for approval. It's got good safety and efficacy to support it.\n\n00:38:31,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n And this is just a fill finish facility.\n\n00:38:35,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n And to the extent that we're aware, there's actually nothing wrong with the product that is coming out of that facility with regard to Apotegramab's quality control and metrics. It just happens to be that. This drug is being produced in this facility and this facility doesn't have overall compliance. Know therefore, according to FDA mandates, regulations they can't approve the drug so, what a shame for the industry.","char_start":33792,"char_end":38174,"start_time":"00:34:42","end_time":null}

Maybe the FDA has to take a look at how it's really regulating these processes because this one seems quite unfortunate for patients.\n\n00:39:09,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n What do you think? The other, the other shame.\n\n00:39:13,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I was going to say, the other shame, I think. Here, Eric, is that, you know, here we are with this zeal to domesticate manufacturing capacity within the United States and do everything we can to ensure, you know, every aspect of manufacturing.\n\n00:39:31,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n And here's a facility in Indiana. Um, where actually the author of the biosecure act, you know, Senator Young is, their representative in Washington, and this facility, and in his state, is running against these issues. Now, these aren't trivial things to fix, but you'd expect to see. A higher level of urgency to get this one done. And support from the agency, of course. and other stakeholders to try to to try to remediate the situation so that you know there is a comfort level around manufacturing in that facility as opposed to going to someplace else like China or Europe or wherever the case might be. It is sadly ironic. In this era, that this is happening.\n\n00:40:29,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Excellent point.\n\n00:40:30,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n What do you guys think the read-through is? I mean, I know this is a frustrating situation that knows maybe feels like there's elements of it that could be like avoidable, but like you know how you're talking to an investor, Eric, like how do you use this situation to kind of you know, gauge risk in other situations.\n\n00:40:48,630 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, that's the problem. Paul, I mean, up until we had a little bit of head time and left. Lead warning on this, but up until August, none of us who were covering this company—Regeneron—knew. Any idea that this was an issue? Right. And now, two months later, we get a little bit more sense of the potential, extent of the issue, and the timeline delay. It is a significant one.\n\n00:41:11,229 [SPEAKER_3]\n And yet, we had no knowledge of it.\n\n00:41:14,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n Know the good news here— if you will, the silver lining is it is just a matter of when these drugs are going to get approved, not if. And investors, as you know, always like to buy the delay and sell the disaster. So this is not a disaster. Both these companies have kind of hung in there. Kudos to both management teams. They've been extremely transparent. On a weekly basis, on the kind of progress they're making or not making. So they've been able to preserve their credibility. But unfortunately, we don't know what the timelines are, and that can be frustrating.\n\n00:41:50,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Alright. Yeah. Banging your head against the wall a bit, hopefully it gets better. Um, John, do you want to talk about the stat summit panel you sat on with? Chris Biebacher and Emma Walmsley on pharma and the 10-year outlook, that sounded pretty interesting and I'm sure it'll uh spark a number of us who want to chime in.\n\n00:42:12,330 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, it was— it was I mean, Stat does such a great job at the summit meetings they've got. And this was this was no, no, no different. In that regard. I mean, of course, we had a hard act to follow. We had baby KJ on the stage before us. So it wasn't, it wasn't.

But it was a panel on the future of biopharma.\n\n00:42:42,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n had a big focus on pricing and MFN and deals. I mean, look, it was, I think between Emma, Chris and I, we were all generally positive. About the future of the industry, even with the policy headwinds that we have been experiencing this year. And I think it just. really highlights the resiliency of the sector to adapt to different legislative or administrative changes that. may happen with governments um and so I think it it just points to you know at the end of the day you know we we're treating disease and and we and our medicines are very important and therefore, you know, we do have to find ourselves comforted by the fact that we can, we can, we'll always be wanted and. were needed for sure. Chris Beebacher, you know, made some interesting points, of course, as always. And one point that I thought he was right on is he was commenting. Not just all the GLPs that are out there right now that are under development.\n\n00:43:47,670 [SPEAKER_2]\n And he was appropriately saying that he's— hoping that more of the sector focuses on other aspects of innovation out there. It seems like people are now doubling down, tripling down on different incremental aspects of that category, although there's probably still a lot more to be done there. You know, the former NIH director Monica Bertagnoli was in the audience and she asked a question about how industry and academia can better work together. And that led to an interesting discussion around public. Trust and belief in the quality of science that comes out of the industry, which I thought was a good discussion. We obviously talked about vaccines. And with Emma being on the stage. And she was very clear that GSK is currently cautious on the U. S. right now as it relates to their vaccine business. But that they are keeping a long-term perspective on it, that they ultimately realize that their vaccines are critical for public health and that this too shall pass.\n\n00:44:57,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then, of course, we talked about China. And I'm obviously made the point. On this topic to highlight that we really are at a Sputnik moment where we should address the competition from China.\n\n00:45:13,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n With initiatives and policies, and maybe CMPV is one of these, where we accelerate getting our medicines to patients faster in this country.\n\n00:45:22,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n Including getting clinical trials done quicker and generating clinical evidence for less money and so forth. Those would be game changers. And then at the end there was a very fun exchange. I have to say about Luca Borin because Matt Herper, who moderated the panel, tried to get Emma to comment a little bit about it. And Emma was very clear that, you know, in their view, it was simply, as she called it, an administrative matter.\n\n00:45:53,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n When I was asked about it, I simply said, 'I just hope they stay grounded in the science.' I left it at that. But it was a good panel and a good discussion. And I think there were other good summit discussions this year as well.\n\n00:46:11,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Excellent, John.\n\n00:46:13,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's great.\n\n00:46:15,319 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, we've got a lot of other topics we can potentially hit on.\n\n00:46:20,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm wondering, Eric or Greg, is there anything that stands out to you guys that you want to talk about next?\n\n00:46:26,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, Paul.\n\n00:46:27,820 [SPEAKER_3]\n I want to hear you talk about Praxis.

Plus, it seems like almost every week we have one of these 'uh, I guess you know' Phoenix from the Ashes kind of stories in biotech.\n\n00:46:42,714 [SPEAKER_1]\n I know, okay. Well, let's do it. So, Praxis announced positive data that, needless to say, was a surprise for their Essential Tremor program. And I think the backdrop here is, first of all, we've had mixed data for this program all along, including a pivotal trial failure earlier. And just more broadly, this space has been so, so, so challenging from a drug development perspective. Tremor is a huge market, but from a drug design perspective, it's very, very hard. It's neurological. You need to develop a drug that attenuates tremor. But many of these approaches do this in a nonspecific way, right? So the more you attenuate the tremor, the more you have side effects like fatigue and dizziness and somnolence because you're sort of just aberrantly tamping down.\n\n00:47:32,799 [SPEAKER_1]\n Brain activity in a non-selective manner. I mean, we see this with antiepileptics to some degree, but tremor, I think, is extra challenging, right, because it's an elderly population that you know is not maybe as experienced as tolerating some of these sedative CNS drugs. Been a really, really tough space, appreciated as a big market. Praxis came out, and the big surprise here was that they had two readouts within this. One was a randomized withdrawal study. And one was an analysis of a parallel group. Aspect is. of this study. And they've had this Bay Street program that is a little bit complicated. I don't need to review, but it's got multiple trials and ways of analyzing this. And I mean, especially the parallel group data looks very good. I think there's going to be some debate around what is a clinically significant effect size in this condition. It reminds me a little bit of tardive dyskinesia, another movement disorder where it's hard to juice out a big effect size and there's a lot of subjectivity around what even is clinically significant.\n\n00:48:29,759 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I don't have any skin in the game here. I follow almost everything in CNS, but this is one I don't formally cover. But from my look, I mean, this looks like it's. It's likely an approvable product and it's a huge market.\n\n00:48:41,450 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, and there were a lot of reasons why the expectations were low. You know, Praxis has another program in epilepsy that is also a program that, in my discussions with investors, is a little bit polarizing. There's some who think that program is a potential blockbuster. There's others who maybe are more critical and don't think that it's. Truly, a new mechanism and wonder— where it fits in an increasingly competitive focal epilepsy landscape. But, you know, I don't think a lot of people thought this tremor data would look like this. Some that thought that their randomized withdrawal study could hit, myself included, because I just think in CNS, those studies almost always hit. But for the data across the board to be favorable like this is a big win for them. And they're a company that has— you know, stuck at this— and also made some tough decisions when times were tough, including, you know, making cuts to extend cash runway. So, yeah, that's my take. Anyone else following this closely?\n\n00:49:29,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm not particularly following it closely, although I have been fascinated by, you know, the development of new treatments for, you know, essential tremor or movement disorders, because historically it's been just so challenging, right? I mean, we look at our experience with Parkinson's disease and while we have a lot of drugs, we really don't have any really good newer drugs— at least it seems, you know. I feel like levodopa, carbidopa is still the longstanding standard of care, which is, I don't prove— maybe 60 years ago. So I thought it was fantastic to see the Praxis data. I don't cover it. I don't follow it closely. I've met the company in the past.","char_start":45046,"char_end":49221,"start_time":"00:46:27","end_time":null}

I don't follow it closely. I've met the company in the past.\n\n00:50:12,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n I do think it's interesting to see two things. One, hopefully it does get approved and what the market opportunity is, but I was thrilled to see them be able to. raise so much money, uh afterwards, which hopefully you know, secures at least uh decent funding, uh for them to be able to flush out the rest of their programs, you know. I do think we're seeing on good data, like, you know, Fairly. Um, robust financings, um, and in many cases, uh, companies are able to add cash that gives them, you know, sometimes two, if not three years, of extra cash runway. And that has been such, such the major issue for our sector for the past four years now.\n\n00:50:54,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'm with you, man. I mean, it's just amazing you look back since Labor Day. I mean, MBX, Rapport, Unicure.\n\n00:51:01,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sure, there's four or five others I'm not thinking of, but just big, big stock upside reactions on data and in some cases bigger than I think investors were prepared for, and um, you know, has emboldened people's confidence that you can get paid for taking on clinical risk.\n\n00:51:19,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Eric, you want to talk about any of your other news items?\n\n00:51:23,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I guess, sure. I always like to talk about my news items.\n\n00:51:28,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n Thank you. Bye. What's most interesting to you?\n\n00:51:31,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let's go to Baikara.\n\n00:51:33,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n Another little Boston company up your neck of the woods.\n\n00:51:37,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n If they had— really had— a very tough first 12 months as a public company, they were kind of the new kid on the block. This had neck cancer space and, uh, had some I thought very interesting phase two data, but the study that they had out was a little bit skimpy. It was presented at ASCO this past year, and what they showed, if you, if you believe the data, and the end is small here, but they had very good response rates, very good long-term survival data, very good duration of response. Really a consistent picture that was all supported by the biological mechanism and a huge area had neck cancer. Um, that could you know potentially be a four billion dollar plus market and support many players. The problem with this stock up until recently was they had a competitor and it was kind of the 800-pound gorilla. In Marist, that was more established, more credible history with investors. A bigger data set and was telling a different narrative. It's one of those situations, guys, and we've all seen them before, where you have this kind of 'he said, she said'\n\n00:52:41,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n between two different companies. John, I know you were in many of these in your prior life as an operator. And yeah, I mean, nobody wins, right? It's just mudslinging back and forth. And usually there's one loser. Sometimes there are two losers. And lo and behold, Marist gets acquired for a nice premium, $8 billion.\n\n00:53:01,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n And the narrative just changes. It flips almost on a dime. So that's kind of what's going on here with this bike car there now. The last remaining company in the space, the storyline cannot be about comparing and contrasting. It can be about how there may be more strategic interest. We should pay more attention to their data. The stock's having a little run, capped off this week by the Breakthrough designation. So the FDA did grant that to the Vicara drug. That's another cherry on their ice cream sundae. Hopefully, more good times ahead for them. But, but it, you know, I guess the, the message here is that.

So we've seen this happen before and happened with a few of the El Nilo programs as well. It becomes an investor. He says, she says, 'I'm right, you're wrong.' It's either or. And it's just not that way with making medicines. And I mean, the Mirage drug is great. The Vicara drug is awesome. And I have no doubt that that that both drugs will get out there, patients will benefit. And there's a lot of them in need— head and neck, and a big, big pie. And it'll only grow. It'll only grow. So I'm.\n\n00:54:27,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n I'm completely aligned with you on this one.\n\n00:54:33,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n Awesome. Greg, do you want to talk about this upcoming elector data? And I'm going to just. Throw on. A couple thoughts of my own at UTC, because maybe we can have a little debate, or I'd love your perspective. So Elector's got this frontage and pearl dementia data coming up later this year. It's a program partnered with GSK.\n\n00:54:51,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n This was a program, Greg, that I used to be a lot more positive on because it does have this genetic medicine angle of increasing progranular levels in patients who are progranular deficient. I think over time, we felt like the mechanistic story here might be a lot more complicated as it relates to the whole sirtuin mechanism and the phase one, two open label data on neurofilament or clinical.\n\n00:55:18,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's just hard to really say much about it. And I don't think we've seen much updates beyond a year. So, you know, given how tough this disease is, I certainly wish this would work. It would be great for the electoral and great for the space. But I'm not holding my breath. But I'd be curious if you have another perspective.\n\n00:55:33,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I know. I mean, this whole neurodegenerative disease space is just so tough. I mean, as Alzheimer's and now we've got this frontotemporal dementia (FTD) — a disease which, for those who don't know, it's the disease that Bruce Willis, our beloved you know, die-hard actor and moonlight actor, um, moonlighting actors, uh, suffering from, unfortunately, but um, yes, they've got a very big chunky, uh, top line phase three data readout, uh, in the mid, uh, middle of next month, um, we've been waiting for the results of this study for a long time. It is a long trial.\n\n00:56:13,429 [SPEAKER_0]\n And Paul, you're right, the prior data.\n\n00:56:16,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n uh, was probably not as clean as perhaps those of us would want to see, ideally speaking. I think the interesting thing, maybe, for us to discuss here is, you know, these neurodegenerative diseases, you know, high unmet medical need. In this particular case, it is a fatal condition as well. And we are awaiting the results of the study where, interestingly, there are two co-primary endpoints. It was a recent addition. To or change to the SAP for the study, but there is an efficacy readout. Then, just recently, there was the addition of a biomarker-based endpoint. Which is, uh, there are now two co-primary endpoints. Um, but with that being said, um, it'll be very interesting. With respect to the data, which, if you look at the market cap of Elector, it's something on the order of about $300 million. $ 300 million dollars, let's call it uh, and as of June 30th, they had reported about 300 million in cash.","char_start":52630,"char_end":56363,"start_time":"00:53:49","end_time":null}

And again, given the complexities of the disease and that we have, you know, prior data, which we're not necessarily a slam dunk, I think it is prudent to be cautious on this. But, you know, we're all so attuned to like, um, looking at clinical trial outcomes. You know, you've got to hit 0. 005 or better to be able to be a win. So speak, it'll be very interesting to see what the efficacy data are with respect to this readout. I do think that you're talking about a neurology division that in the past has shown a fair amount of regulatory flexibility when it comes to perhaps controversial drugs, right? In Alzheimer's and ALS. We've got three such examples, whether it is Aduhelm from Biogen, whether it is Calzodi from Biogen and Ionis, and the ALS drug from Amelix Pharmaceuticals, Relivrio.\n\n00:58:25,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n So it'll be very interesting to see if they end up missing on the primary endpoint, what the p-value looks like, and how close or not close are they to achieving point you know, offer that, you know, if they were to hit something like on a p-value, if they don't indeed hit on achieving the primary endpoint, but if they're at something like 0. 07 or 0. 08, like it'll be very interesting to see what the FDA does for disease where there isn't a lot of clinical trial activity. This is the first drug that's been taken to phase three by any company in the past. There are a few other programs on the competitive landscape, but again, they might be several years away in a condition that is fatal.\n\n00:59:18,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n I would say an interesting readout. Again, one where the market currently doesn't expect it to work. And I agree. Paul, that there are many reasons why you can be skeptical. Yes, I'm hopeful as well and we'll just see how it all turns out.\n\n00:59:37,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, totally. I'm certainly not pretending like I have a consensus view here, but thanks for the great overview and setup. So we've got a minute or two left. John, Eric, any last closing remarks from you guys on what's on your mind over the next few weeks?\n\n00:59:55,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n The one thing I would say is, you know, this New England Journal paper on the Odoferlin story with Regeneron is just another proof point out there. That gene therapy is not over. Look at Unicure, look at this story. And gene therapy remains an important modality for some of these ultra-rare diseases.\n\n01:00:19,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n We should elude side of that. That's my only last point.\n\n01:00:23,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I'm heading to Berlin this weekend and we're going to see a lot of innovation and cancer, which oncology is sometimes bashed a little bit by investors these days for being too crowded, too competitive, and too fast-paced. Boy, there's some some great stuff coming out that we're looking forward to seeing.\n\n01:00:42,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Awesome.\n\n01:00:44,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining. John, Greg, Eric, appreciate it. And thanks, everyone, for listening. And we'll look forward to hearing you on the next Biotech Hangout.","char_start":56063,"char_end":59566,"start_time":"00:57:22","end_time":null}

A live and unedited weekly discussion of all the latest news in our industry with a group of biotech insiders. I'm Chris Garabedian, and my co-host today are Brian Scorney and Sam Fazelli. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com. We like to start a lot of these on just the market update. And, you know, finally, after many years, it feels like things have shifted and that we're in a kind of a better news.\n\n00:00:30,070 [SPEAKER_0]\n better sentiment environment. Obviously, we've talked previously about the XBI breaking 100, staying there, a little bit of ups and downs, pullbacks, but nothing significant. And it's maintained itself. And the public markets are looking good. M&A is generally good. I'll speak a little bit about VCs. But Brian, why don't you? Kick us off from your perspective of kind of what you're seeing and how you would describe the current public market environment.\n\n00:00:56,260 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, thanks, Chris. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've been saying this on the last couple of weeks for Biotech Clubhouse. It's really an optimistic, enthusiastic.\n\n00:01:05,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n public market out there right now. I mean, people. I was out marketing in New York yesterday, but across all my meetings recently, investors have been really upbeat.\n\n00:01:15,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think underpinning this is the concept that, you know, this isn't just upbeat because, you know, we're in an uber bull market. But there's a lot of comfort out there that, you know, we're sort of in this upward swinging market right here, but without sort of crazy valuations and, you know, companies that are four years from going into the clinic, IPOing at a billion dollar valuation. But we're still in kind of a liftoff off of the trough that we've seen. You know, after multiple years of XBI underperformance. So, you know, I'd say sentiment remains very high. You know, I think there's an occasional mention of, like, oh, is it, you know, is there going to be a shoe to drop and like this?\n\n00:01:58,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, exuberance is irrational and, you know, Trump is going to say something or do something or, you know, something's going to blow up on a clinical trial side of things and take us down. But, you know, when you look at the last month or so or even the last three months, you know, health care has this month been one of the most net bought sectors and biotech exposure has really been pulling to five-year highs. Um so you know, we're thematically, we think that this is a realization of something that we've certainly been talking about. In that, we've seen chasing of risk in other sectors, obviously the AI trade in tech that has pushed valuations to historical extremes. But biotech kind of sat it out for a really long time. But at some point it was inevitable that people would kind of. Think of this as a catch-up trade. Given that it's a sector that historically has had the opportunity for kind of massive alpha capture. Certainly on individual names. And we're kind of seeing that in individual names, you know, whether it's. Names like Unicure last month or even Praxis last week, you're getting these data sets where you're seeing hundreds of percent upside on catalysts and that type of thing cannot go unnoticed.\n\n00:03:08,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I think that's what's happening.\n\n00:03:09,920 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, one of the things that even in some of the data we'll describe, uh, on, on this call is that the stocks are reacting good or bad, right? You're seeing good. Volume, good movement. And for a while, we weren't seeing that, right? You'd see a kind of a sell off on good news if there was a run up or like almost a fickle response to data. And here. It seems like the market's becoming more efficient. I mean, would you describe it that way?\n\n00:03:39,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um.","char_start":0,"char_end":4030,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

I mean, would you describe it that way?\n\n00:03:39,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um.\n\n00:03:40,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think so. I mean, some of it is right, some of the data is upside, surprise. So, I think to some extent, like— like um Like I mentioned, Praxis. Like, it wasn't just that it was positive data, which I don't think people were really thinking was going to happen with something that had a futility, look, go poorly, and they continued the study anyway. But it was like really positive. You know, every endpoint hitting. So, it is sort of that like unexpectedness to the sector where it's worth nothing and then just becomes worth an enormous amount because of better than expected data. But for sure, I mean, I think even on things that are potentially expected data sets, maybe arguably a little better than expected. You're still seeing stocks perform in the aftermath of that. And, you know, we'll talk about this in a little bit. But I think you also see that in sort of the follow-on offering environment as well.\n\n00:04:38,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And, and what's your take? I know the following has been, uh, Mark has been strong, but what's your take on how you would predict IPOs over, I mean, you know, usually we'll see a flurry after disclosures and definitely I'm interested to see what happens after the year end disclosures. I mean, we saw, you know, uh, I mean, the last, you know, really push around IPOs in the early, you know, 2021 time frame. I just remember, uh, in that, you know, February, early February, peak. But how are you thinking about what we'll see with IPOs over the next couple of quarters?\n\n00:05:13,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so I think you're going to see an acceleration. I mean, certainly, I mean, you're coming from such a trough in terms of IPOs, right? Like even a couple IPOs is all of a sudden like opening up the floodgates relative to earlier in the year, right? So, look, I mean, I think we went through this prolonged period where we had. Uh, you know, a desert of IPOs, not necessarily because.\n\n00:05:37,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n people weren't willing to invest in IPOs, although certainly the tolerance for public investing in IPOs was missing, but for fundamental reasons—right, like we saw this huge argument you know I would argue bubble into COVID where you saw things. you know, banks were pulling companies from such early stages at high valuations.\n\n00:06:00,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n you know, it was inevitable that when it kind of crashed down you would wind up waiting for private companies to kind of catch up. you know, we're kind of at the catch-up point, right? So if everything IPO'd, that was three years from the clinic. Five years ago. Everything that didn't IPO, now you're getting close to the clinic and that's where you have reasonable. IPO potential when you're you know past early discovery phase and like nominating a drug in a big indication or in phase one in a smaller indication so yeah definitely I think we'll see more yeah I think there was nervousness too about Not.\n\n00:06:33,290 [SPEAKER_0]\n trusting the markets and knowing if you would trade down if you went IPO, even if you got a good price. you know, at the launch and how the aftermarket performance was going to be. And so I think there's also this increased trust and comfort that, you know, the stock prices will hold, right? You know, there'll be kind of better valuations that hold maybe better price discovery, like we saw with LB. Pharma and their IPO. But, you know, look, I'm pleased as a VC investor that. You know, we're, you know, we're a lagging indicator to the public market sentiment and that's true on the way down and it's true on the way up. So we get very encouraged and much more comfortable deploying capital and even starting new companies and all of that when we feel there's a healthy IPO market, healthier valuations. Public markets. So I'm definitely seeing that trickle down. There's definitely more of a willingness to write checks. And I think we'll see more VCs getting more active moving forward if these kind of public signals hold.","char_start":3732,"char_end":8045,"start_time":"00:03:39","end_time":null}

And I think we'll see more VCs getting more active moving forward if these kind of public signals hold.\n\n00:07:38,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, we've done three investments over the last six weeks or so, one device, one diagnostic out of the venture fund. I manage one therapeutic in the gout space. Crystalis, but I'm seeing the peer group really start to feel like this is the time we can start being comfortable deploying capital. The M &A environment has an impact on that too. So again, we're really encouraged. We're encouraged by the XBI. We're encouraged by, you know, what the IPO market might look like. By healthier valuations and not exuberance, right? Nobody wants to go back to what you were describing, preclinical companies going at a billion. Because I think overall that wasn't healthy. But also the M &A environment is putting good. So why don't we start off with. kind of deals of the week. And let's start with a two plus billion dollar acquisition. You want to lead this one, Brian, for. Avidel.\n\n00:08:34,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, so Alkermes, which we cover here at Baird, my colleague, Luke Harmon's lead analyst on that, you know, they, they did a $2. 1 billion acquisition for.\n\n00:08:45,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n a narcolepsy drug, basically, from Avidel. This drug is Lumirez. It's an oxibate treatment. It competes, you know, pretty directly with Jazz's Zywave. And, you know, they're They're expecting Lumeriz to do between 265 and 275 million in revenue. In 2025, it's a growing product. They have a couple of label-expanding studies that are ongoing. And certainly both Zywave and Lumres have grown together. So I think every expectation is: this is not a peak, but we'll continue to see some pretty meaningful growth. For both products over time. But it's also a really interesting way for Alkermes to get a commercial foot in the door in narcolepsy. So Alkermes, many people will be familiar with the orexin-2 receptor agonist. Alkermes has one of the leads there in ALA. Alexa Rexton, which is one of these in this hot new class. So it sort of has the benefit of creating something that's pretty near-term accretive to Alkermes. but also builds out commercial capabilities for competing in the Ericsson 2 class once we see Alexa Ericsson through Phase 3.\n\n00:09:50,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n very interesting combination of both sort of spec format, a creative deal, but also building into infrastructure and the commercial capability and showing confidence in their orexin to narcolepsy drug here. Certainly, I'm seeing a multibillion dollar acquisition. You know, it's not a mega block. It's a megabillion-dollar acquisition, but is needle moving for the sector? And, you know, I think just adds to the bulk of evidence that you're seeing. More and more enthusiasm for paying for these assets.\n\n00:10:20,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And, you know, I saw on Twitter, someone made the parallel to, I think they talked about it last week, but a company, we were investors in Astria, got acquired by Biochrist. Again, similarly. The same space, you know, Biochrist having a commercial drug launch, but also trying to increase their kind of footprint in the HAE space, and also you know, kind of consolidate, you know, therapies. And so, again, you know, very interesting to, you know, see companies really want to maintain a leadership position in specific indications.\n\n00:10:52,470 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, Brian, I think you and Sam have something to say on the summit financing. Again, big. Big follow-on—uh, you want to start, and then Sam, you can comment.","char_start":7745,"char_end":11519,"start_time":"00:07:38","end_time":null}

Again, big. Big follow-on—uh, you want to start, and then Sam, you can comment.\n\n00:11:02,440 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so Summit did a $500 million deal. I mean, this is one of the most hotly debated names, and I know Sam's going to go into much more depth on some of their data that they have. Over the last week. But this is, you know, the primary story here is their VEGF PD-1 by specific. And look, the interesting thing. Here is the summit management team. You know, they are one of the more interesting management teams out there. A long time ago, I covered PCYC, which is really the CEO kind of introduction to the the the biotherapeutic space, and wound up being one of the biggest deals of all time and certainly one of the best products of all time. It's the basis of a really great book by Nate Vardy called 'For Blood and Money.' But, you know, Bob Duggan, the CEO here, he sort of has a history of doing this— of really putting his money where his mouth is. He's really quite unique in the world of biotech CEOs. In all of his companies, he's really been the main financier to push their drugs through clinical development.\n\n00:12:06,770 [SPEAKER_1]\n Sometimes that's been uh uh less less successful, but certainly in the example of PCYC it's been uh enormously successful and um you know so far uh summit is has uh seen a much uh greater valuation than than the money he has put into it. So his basis is way lower, although basis is rising with this financing here. But it's certainly a bullish signal when you get a management team to put effectively half of the of the deal together from their own personal checkbooks.\n\n00:12:40,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, it's definitely another endorsement for blood and money. Just a great, great story for biotech with the Pharmacyclic, Asserta kind of battle and perceptive. Obviously, it was featured in that as well as an early investor in Asserta. But but yeah, so. And Pharmacyclic. Yeah right exactly uh and so um uh so yeah great Sam you want to comment on this.\n\n00:13:02,050 [SPEAKER_2]\n Somebody we're going to talk about the data just very quickly that you you know this is one of those situations where you In pretty much every case, management putting money up into their own company is a bullish signal.\n\n00:13:18,640 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's just. In a situation like this, where you have a phase three drug, which has meaningful data behind it. You do wonder why they couldn't go and get more from institutional investors, or did they not want to get more from institutional investors? I mean, it's very hard for me to criticize Bob because it's such a successful story behind him and of course I've also read the book. If anybody hasn't, we all get royalties of it, right?\n\n00:13:49,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, the fastest way to become a biotech billionaire is to have very big, concentrated investments. Absolutely right.\n\n00:13:55,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, you know, he's kind of literally proving the fact that he believes in this data. The thing is that we all need to see, and as we come to it later, I'll do the bull and bear side of this data set that just came out and then talk about it. But yeah, so 50% coming from insiders, bullish, bearish, I don't know.\n\n00:14:15,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can tell you on the venture side, right, if I are equated to insiders as institutional investors. Right. That's pretty common, right? When you have you know, insider institutions doing half around right. You know uh on the venture side this is private companies right so you have bigger positions and you want to take your pro rata etc but yeah for a for a late stage clinical stage and that level of money it's big. So, yes, it's hard to read the true courage of their convictions. How much of that was Bob Dugan's own? Money and, and what is that in terms of his overall, you know, net worth, you know, all of that needs to be considered. But we're going to talk more about the data. Coming out of ESMO and the Barron Bowl thesis on that. Brian, some other updates on financings this week.\n\n00:15:02,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'll tell you later.","char_start":11219,"char_end":15552,"start_time":"00:10:52","end_time":null}

Brian, some other updates on financings this week.\n\n00:15:02,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'll tell you later.\n\n00:15:04,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n So yeah, as I was kind of alluding to in the intro commentary, I mean, one of the things we're really seeing is really great performance on follow-ons. We're seeing a lot of deals get done. And I guess it's no surprise with the XBI moving. Um, up and to the right. Uh, you know, I would always advise management teams to take, um, to take money when they can, um, and pad the balance sheets to weather through harder days. But we've certainly seen a lot of success here. And what's really notable is you see a lot of after-the-fact success. So a deal will get done and then the stocks will appreciate immediately.\n\n00:15:39,700 [SPEAKER_1]\n That dynamic works a bunch over the last couple of weeks. We saw it work very well early this week in Alto Neuroscience. They announced a FDA meeting update that was positive for one of their programs, Alto 207. But really, the stock is now up 65% on the week. I think more coming off a subsequent $50 million pipe.\n\n00:16:00,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think some of your colleagues.\n\n00:16:04,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um, you know, a lot of the biotech investors have gone on as named investors in this. And I think people buy it after the fact because one of the big. biggest pushbacks I'd get from clients over the last couple of years is, how are these, you know, oh, even if I like this story, how are they going to get to catalysts here? I mean, these companies, these are going to suffer massive dilution. They can't raise the capital. It's really been a bear thesis on the sector like. No one's going to be able to finance. So now you're seeing a little bit of a reversal of that dynamic where, when they do finance, it almost creates this FOMO where people are like, 'Oh, I always liked the story, but I just didn't invest because, like, I didn't think they would be able to finance the company.' Now they've financed the company. So you see, like, good aftermarket performance on these names. And, and, and, you know, I think certainly. With Alto, you saw that robust demand earlier this week. And you see it across a number of names. We also saw a little bit of this with Nurex this week. There's another name. Cover they did a 250 million dollar registered direct um you know it's not it's up less on a on a percentage basis than alto because it's a larger market cap but um you also had really robust interest um you know the knock on the story has been Most people say, yeah, it looks like they have a really\n\n00:17:16,109 [SPEAKER_1]\n great BTK grader, and that's Brutigieg. But how are you going to finance all the studies that are needed in CLI? to kind of move this up lines when you're competing against a much bigger name like Beijing. And this is the answer. So people, you know, it's sort of created a much more positive narrative. able to finance and put up a meaningful amount of cash on a balance sheet from, you know, very well respected investors. And, you know, I think this is a good. Signal for companies to, you know, if they could get, you know, a good contingent of investors to invest and, you know, you could use additional money. You know, companies have done quite well off that dynamic these days.\n\n00:17:58,800 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. I mean, I think, look, despite the overall XBI performance or whatever broad sector performance you want to look at, which hasn't been good for biotech for probably 10 years. Uh, overall, it's a stock picker's market, right? That's what I'm hearing. Like, you're seeing names where they believe it's going to work and they know that there's going to be good returns uh for that investment and money's flowing into those names that get that good. You know, specialty biotech investors are interested, and I think overall, it's what we've been waiting for and something that's healthy. For our market.\n\n00:18:32,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sam, there's also another strategic deal, maybe you want to highlight, which is, again, is the other side of the coin for a healthy market is the financings, but also the deal flow.","char_start":15252,"char_end":19582,"start_time":"00:15:02","end_time":null}

So we had a actually a China deal with the Japanese pharma company. So Takeda did a deal with Innovent. Um and it was a pretty hefty deal—$1. 2 billion dollars up front. Um and um, about what the total bio dollars everybody knows what that means. I think. 4 billion dollars, and of course the kid also invested in Innoven's shares at $100 million at a premium.\n\n00:19:15,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n What's interesting here, of course, is that it's essentially an oncology deal. So you have a couple of late-stage assets and then an earlier-stage asset. And on the late-stage asset, which is the IBI363 PD1 IL2 alpha bias.\n\n00:19:33,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, by specific.\n\n00:19:36,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's a co-commercialization, a global co-commercialization deal and co-development. So that's pretty interesting. I haven't seen too many examples of this where the Chinese. A partner keeps some of the rights that particularly they highlight the US side of it. So I think this is a way of of the companies getting more international rather than just licensing out their drug or um doing a new co. Of course, we've had data on uh 363 before. There was some desk data at ASCO which I have to say was pretty Pretty exciting to us, at least, in terms of the efficacy that it showed in in lung cancer.\n\n00:20:19,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n We think that's an interesting asset. Of course, there's a whole bunch of people who are after this way of trying to get the IL-2 back into the system to get the T-cells motoring, for want of a better phrase. And here, Biospecific is one way of doing it. The other asset is a Clodin 18. 2, still around, so IBI 343 ADC. And then, of course, Takeda has taken an option also on IBI 3001, which is an EGFR-B7H3 ADC, so a biospecific ADC there. We're seeing more of these EGFR3, EGFR-B7H3. Um, type of bispecifics with ADC on them and so, so this was a pretty big deal for again, within the context, so we've just totted up our numbers for the year and China has taken this was a very quick analysis so just just to just to caveat that about 4.\n\n00:21:20,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n 7 billion up front in terms of 2025 so far and total buy dollar values of 84 and a half billion dollars And, of course, it comes hot on the heels, not so hot on the heels, but it was ASCO where Pfizer and 3S Bio, which is for ASCO, announced their $1. 25 billion deal on the PD-1 VEGF that 3S Buyer has developed. That's great.\n\n00:21:44,380 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, and uh, What else we have? Did you want to highlight what's going on in Europe? You like to keep a pulse on that. A big deal in Europe. Yeah.\n\n00:21:53,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n We like to talk about stuff that's positive in Europe. We've had a spate of times where people are writing up about how pharma is forgetting about everywhere and just investing all their money in the US, which of course is never, never the total truth. But nevertheless, we did have a very interesting company that I saw about just under a year ago at a VC conference, Tubulus. That raised $360 million in a Series C. Now, that's a pretty hefty number. Certainly, for Europe, and even globally, I think that's a pretty chunky number for a Series C. And it's an ADC company, which we don't seem to be able to get away from. Their latest asset, TUB040, is an anti-NAPI-2B ADC, and we just saw some data for it at at ESMO, which actually I have to say was pretty decent in in ovarian cancer. So that was a sort of response levels that you don't expect to see: 59% response rate on the overall dose ranging trial.\n\n00:22:58,740 [SPEAKER_2]\n And that was really pretty impressive again. So the question is now: do they have enough money to take this to phase three? Meaning that's the plan, essentially, at the end, maybe, potentially, lung cancer and Wolverine, if I'm not wrong. And that then leaves us with the question of, is this a less load-up with cash and then go and partner situation where we can get a much better deal? Potential partnership versus going with it with coffers that are empty.

The round was led by Venrock, and then with participation from additional new investors, Wellington Management and Ascenta, and existing investors who also supported, were Nextech, EQT Life Sciences, Frazier, Andera, DeepTrack.\n\n00:23:53,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n Bayern Capital and he goes on— you know, I can mention that's a great, great, great syndicate and those who are gonna figure out how to get that financed, right? If $ 350 million doesn't Doesn't do it. Yeah. Um, I looked at our genic stock for the first time in a while, and it's over $50 billion. It's good. It's got a good year. In value creation and so, uh, and I just a few weeks ago. But parenthetically, I was that invited to do this uh panel at BIOSpain, which is a little bit like a bio Europe— it attracts a lot of other countries to exhibit and do partner meetings there. And I was part of an investor delegation, both U. S. or ex-Spain. local investors. And I can tell you, in Europe, there's a lot of activity and there's a lot of waiting for the market to improve. And it seems like over the last three to five years, they're just toiling away as best they can, waiting for the financial markets to kind of catch up. So I was impressed with what I saw going on in some of the European interactions I had.\n\n00:24:55,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Chris, on that point, I've always had this feeling. That Europe kind of waits for six months, nine months, or twelve months to see how solid the recovery in the US is. Do you get that feeling still? Because you did actually. Use the word 'wait.' Do you feel that they're all hanging, waiting to see whether the excitement and the resurgence of interest in U. S. bias is going to wash over here?\n\n00:25:19,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm being a little bit kind. I think it's partly necessity, right? They have to wait. I think that. You know, as an investor, I can tell you that. Um. You know, people want to seriously look at the technology first and be less concerned. This isn't true with every VC, but less concerned about where it comes from and who the management team is, if they're capable. You know, if you know there's a lot of good examples of great science and great technology being developed successfully, you know, coming out of Europe. And so I think, you know, and Brad Loncar does a good job of kind of making biotech TV global in nature. And he does a lot of these kind of tours and showcases a lot of these companies. And I think that's a good thing for our industry. But when I say waiting, I think they're like waiting for the appetite for investment to stick up. And of course, we're always going to be— kind of the lion's share of that. Obviously, we're seeing China play a big piece in that. But I think Europe, they still have to compete for it, right? There's still a lot more. That are not going to get funded the way they want versus those that get selected.\n\n00:26:21,790 [SPEAKER_0]\n But I think they're kind of waiting for investors to start to get interested. Now, that's very different on the private side than the public side, obviously. But, um, but yeah, I, I think that all of the signs lift all boats, right. All of these positive signals we're seeing. And, um, I'm hopeful that, uh, you know, all of the discovery research and basic research is not that expensive. So that's what I mean. They're toiling away. They can, they can get stuff done and they can get ready for that, you know, 30 million. Million series A round, or that, you know, 80 million, you know, series B or et cetera. And I think that, that's kind of what they're waiting for, is for people to have an appetite, if that makes sense.\n\n00:27:01,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Fingers crossed they will come.","char_start":23385,"char_end":27580,"start_time":"00:23:29","end_time":null}

We are a little bit of a skeleton crew here, so you're going to hear a lot from Sam. But I think the audience definitely wants to hear the update. You were on the ground there. So maybe let's start with Summit, since we touched on that to begin.\n\n00:27:20,630 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah and and Chris and Brian just jump in whenever you want to say anything on this. Obviously, Summit Therapeutics is, I mean, this is a massive conference, right? ESMO, I think, was almost rivaled ASCO this year. Maybe not quite in terms of numbers, but it was certainly quite clear that a lot of Chinese companies presenting there, which I think partly is because the science is evolving and the programs are continuing to become numerous, but also because I think it's perhaps a little bit to do with the geopolitics at the minute.\n\n00:27:56,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Anyhow, so Summit, which of course his drug was in license from Akiso. This is Ibanezumab. which is their key drug at the minute. And pretty much mostly, although they've just announced that they're going to start a phase three colorectal cancer in non-small cell. And this is the PD-1 vet, just in case somebody doesn't know, because it's been such a topical story for months now. Um, and it's Kisa who presented the Harmony 6 data, which is squamous non-small cell lung cancer in China. So it was Ivanisamab plus chemo versus a PD-1 plus chemo. So you're essentially putting a bispecific, which brings in VEGF with it, versus a PD-1. 532 patients enrolled, median follow-up 10. 3 months, and you got a pretty nice PFS difference of 11. 1 versus 6. 9. So that's great. Hazard ratio of 0. 6. I think we have to admit that's pretty good. In essentially adding one extra mechanism of action here.\n\n00:29:00,800 [SPEAKER_2]\n AEs were manageable. Remember, this is squamous non-small cell, which has been historically something that people have worried about putting VEGF in because of some early bad experiences.\n\n00:29:12,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n And there was a clear effect across all PD-L1s, even less than 1%. So this is the bull side. That's quite clear.\n\n00:29:22,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think for China, this is a very simple, easy signal. I think I don't know whether they need to wait for OS. We saw nothing about OS, not even a commentary about trends or anything, which is slowly bringing me up onto the bare side of this. What did we not get? What are the caveats? So we didn't get any news on OS.\n\n00:29:44,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n Always a worry, given the history of VEGF. And I can talk about that a little bit. Because you do wonder whether the VEGF effect is on the tumor response, on the tumor size to a degree, but doesn't translate to OS, which has been the case in many tumors with VEGF. And you've got that situation also a little bit with the Harmony trial.\n\n00:30:11,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n Which failed to show NOS statistical significant benefit, although there was a difference. And the Harmony trial was in second line post-EG. CFR in China again. And of course, there was an additional patient group in the US, but the PFS didn't translate to a statistically significant OS benefit. So this adds that little question mark. And oh my God, are we dealing with another VEGF set of stories here? The Kaplan-Meier curves.","char_start":27280,"char_end":30942,"start_time":"00:27:01","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_1b6dbc7c530f_chunk_0008","doc_id":"doc_1b6dbc7c530f","order":8,"text":"e post-EG. CFR in China again. And of course, there was an additional patient group in the US, but the PFS didn't translate to a statistically significant OS benefit. So this adds that little question mark. And oh my God, are we dealing with another VEGF set of stories here? The Kaplan-Meier curves.\n\n00:30:40,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n Do you see a big drop just at around scan three, which is always the thing again with VEGF. You get an early impact on tumor size. And scan one or scan two or scan three, and then and then it everything is parallel. The lines are parallel. So I think the Bulls would say, but some of the lines were not parallel and they were continuing to separate. But in this case. It was, um, I, I would say that most of them are, and so that leaves you again with a worry that maybe this won't translate to us. And of course, the hazard ratio was pretty much irrespective of PD-L1 expression. So it gives you this little nagging feeling. Is this all about VEGF? Is this just VEGF doing a lot of the work and not necessarily the PD-L1? And then, of course, they did exclude patients with the risk of bleeding, as they should have, because there's a risk with VEGF in those patients. And then you therefore wonder whether this is going to be easily translatable and what happens to it when it comes to the US.\n\n00:31:41,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n So really, those were the positives, those were the negatives. The other thing that's happening is that we're continuing to see more and more PD-L1 VEGFs showing up. We saw a new one in non-small cell lung. Looking good. From HuboBio.\n\n00:31:58,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Remagen had a good one in gastric, which we really like the data of. So the other thing that someone needs to watch out for is who comes rapidly behind them. And lastly, on this and I'll leave you guys to comment potentially is: It seems to me that a lot of these situations with these biospecifics, you do want to try and get a combination partner. And Pfizer, with their 3S Bio, Bristol-Myers, with their BioNTech deal and BioNTech itself, and even some of the Chinese companies like Remagen, they have a bunch of other ADCs like Trop2 ADCs, et cetera, to combine with. So that's what I think Summit also needs to get on with and figure out a way of doing more partnerships. They did do one with Pfizer.\n\n00:32:41,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, but then of course Pfizer went and did the 3S Bio deal, so yeah. Um, did you want to add anything?\n\n00:32:46,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, no. Brian, did you have any comments on the bull-bear debate? I don't know if you're covering Summit or one of your uh colleagues does, but just any any thoughts on this uh because it does seem there's uh different sides.\n\n00:32:59,400 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, I'm largely out of it. I kind of follow it out of interest. And, you know, I know Bob and McKee very well. I know Mommy very well. You know, I meet with him and, you know, every every medical conference and try to get a hook on it. You know, I'm very torn on the Bull Bear debate.\n\n00:33:19,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n You just look at it globally and you wonder.\n\n00:33:22,420 [SPEAKER_1]\n A, is this really doing something different than if you combined Avastin and Keytruda? And B, does that even matter? Because no one's combining Keytruda. Have asked in any of these studies in a formal manner anyway. So just even if it's the same thing, if you're successful, you're successful and you become the standard of care. But yeah, I mean, it's a tough one to call, especially as Sam kind of reiterated. You know, Avastin sort of has this weird ability to drive radiographic benefit that hasn't necessarily correlated in long-term survival.\n\n00:33:57,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n Given the mechanisms, so when you're dealing, especially with things like PFS and overall response rate, trying to figure out how that predicts ultimate benefit to the patients can be quite tricky.\n\n00:34:08,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, in this kind of dynamic, yeah, let me ask you both a question about oncology and especially new targets where, I, I feel like, there's this phenomenon where, uh, you get kind of peak hype early, and then there's always kind of a slow, right? Disappointment and/ or competition enters the fray. You guys want to comment on like.","char_start":30642,"char_end":34899,"start_time":"00:30:40","end_time":null}

That you know, there seems to be this excitement upon a new target in the first positive data set. But. It seems like the bloom comes off the rose. Over time and is Would you guys say that or is that just really? situation dependent.\n\n00:34:56,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Fine.\n\n00:34:58,470 [SPEAKER_1]\n I kind of think it's situation dependent, although I mean, certainly there is sort of this consistent dynamic of in biotech, you could get overexcited about early data and then. you know, as reality sets in, it could be quite disappointing. But there's certainly examples where people get excited and, you know, the mechanism or specific drug continues to generate that excitement, right? And, you know, I go back to PCYC, like it was a battle on PCYC as a bowl. People were like, 'Oh, you're just overestimating how long these patients are going to be on it and how good of a drug it is.' But, you know, it turns out, like, I think, you know, if I look at my models from PCYC, I still wound up underestimating it as one of the bigger bulls. But, you know, you brought up, like, CD47. You brought up Tidget. Tidget's like. Super unique to me because you know we do have this tendency, and I would certainly argue, for example, about like getting overly enthusiastic about like a single arm response rate study digits like interesting to me because That's really one of the only times I can remember, you know, a not totally rigorous, but somewhat rigorous, randomized, controlled study showing like a profound benefit that just was never replicated.\n\n00:36:03,390 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so look, I think I'm going to remain a bull of Tidget. We'll wait and see.\n\n00:36:10,319 [SPEAKER_2]\n You can shoot me down when we get to talk about it again, when the data trial, when the trials read out. Certainly, in the by specific space, because it you know IL-2 PD1 TJ PD1 CTLA4 PD1 these you could easily bring a good biological explanation for why you want those types of y specifics because you're acting on the same cell and you're taking away, hopefully, especially if it's conditional binding or at least partly conditional binding, some of the side effect issues that at least some of these drugs have, like IL-2 and CTLA-4.\n\n00:36:44,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's wait till it reads out. I mean, you know, AstraZeneca, I had an excellent conversation today with Suzanne Goldbraith, who will.\n\n00:36:53,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n who will air as a podcast next week. And we didn't really get to talk about PIDGET because there was so much stuff at ESMO from them on breast cancer and pretty much on everything. But we spoke about breast and bladder mostly.\n\n00:37:07,820 [SPEAKER_2]\n The thing is, that makes sense. You want to have these things binding on the same cell. PD-1VEGF, I don't know, right? I mean, we do know that VEGF has— some checkpoint inhibitor. At least some people believe it's got some checkpoint inhibitor, checkpoint activity. So that's where I think it's different.\n\n00:37:28,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n My point was more on what Brian highlighted, which is the days of looking at a single arm, you know, 15 patient study where the early signal looks good. That I think they're skeptical of, let's see a larger cohort over time or assistance. Um, but there was a lot of else, else going on at SAM at ESMO. So, let's go through the list.\n\n00:37:48,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so Exelixis was another one where the share price had a bad reaction to what I think initially. So I'm going to give you a bull and bear there as well. So this is the STELLAR-303 trial, which reported that this is in colorectal cancer, third-line colorectal cancer for zanzalimib. My God. It's too hard for a Friday afternoon.\n\n00:38:14,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n With an anti-PD-L1 therapy. So what did we see initially when you look at it, which is why I think the share price had the. the drop that it did, again, third-line CRC, you had a toxicity that seemed to be more than Stivarga.\n\n00:38:30,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n You had a benefit, definitely, 10. 9 versus 9. 4 survival benefit. Is that particularly exciting or not? And.","char_start":34599,"char_end":39073,"start_time":"00:34:32","end_time":null}

Is that particularly exciting or not? And.\n\n00:38:42,970 [SPEAKER_2]\n And the OS benefit and PFS benefit didn't really go beyond benchmarks. You would believe that because it's a novel mechanism, it'll be obviously more expensive. And of course, it is an IV infusion. So these things, but particularly those two first points I made about efficacy and toxicity. I think upset. folks for a little while. And then of course the share price has recovered.\n\n00:39:06,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n Again, I was lucky to have my friends from Lyric and Cruist in the office on Wednesday, and we had a webinar that's on our, I think. Actually posted on it. So Andy Behrens was there talking up their bull story. So by third line, patients will most likely have had two lines of chemo already and not really be ready to take another one. So that's one of the issues that I think is particularly valuable here because you don't need chemo in it. Doctors are eager to really identify the sorts of patients who will respond to IO therapy. Decentric in this case in Stellar 303. So to induce a durable response, because that's what the opportunity you've got here. And I think the folks that Andy, my friend, spoke to.\n\n00:39:50,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n But thought that they could take care of the Zanzibar talks as they did with Stevarga. And it still performed well post-VEGF agents. So really this is, and I think the bulls are winning here now, post the conference, and I think that's probably the right place to be, because of the um these facts that we talked about, so that was the initial reaction, and then the post reaction, so that was quite interesting to watch, but it was a it was a pretty well designed trial and um The data was, in the end, compelling, I think, for at least some patients. It is third line. So that's a particularly difficult patient population.\n\n00:40:29,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't know if you guys wanted to have any comments on this.\n\n00:40:33,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n No comments. No comments. Yes, you can go through the list.\n\n00:40:37,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. All right. So the other thing that really interested me was Insight coming into the Keras G12D world, and this is a drug with Genfleet.\n\n00:40:48,220 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's a novel G12D. Remember, this is a space that's quite meaningfully dominated by revolutionary medicines with some very, very good drugs, which of course we've seen.\n\n00:40:59,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, much data for, of course, that's one of the stories that's been able to raise significant amounts of money. Um, particularly for, uh, pancreatic. So here we had, a, a data set that we think rivaled revolution medicines sold on recipe, and that was the, um, the G12D from inside. So what did we see? This is in CP161734. Right? Strong dose-dependent tumor control up to about 86% at 1,200 milligrams, 64% in terms of ORR at the 600 milligrams. And the response rates dropped since May for other competing drugs.\n\n00:41:42,660 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, uh, interesting that particularly for gen fleets GFH 375, and that's at a lower rate of about 41 percent now since the early disclosure of that data set. So it's still impressive as a single agent. So the G12D space for Keras is hotting up. We have the Insight, we have Genfleet, we have the drug from Revolution Medicine. And I think at the triple, we'll see some more new agents that we haven't seen data for, presented. So hopefully, maybe next week, if we're still on together, we can talk about some of those.","char_start":38773,"char_end":42504,"start_time":"00:38:30","end_time":null}
{"chunk_id":"doc_1b6dbc7c530f_chunk_0011","doc_id":"doc_1b6dbc7c530f","order":11,"text":"e for Keras is hotting up. We have the Insight, we have Genfleet, we have the drug from Revolution Medicine.

So hopefully, maybe next week, if we're still on together, we can talk about some of those.\n\n00:42:18,230 [SPEAKER_2]\n And so that really positions Insight quite nicely. And I don't know if you've looked at the share price chart. It's been doing like a lot of biotech. It's been doing reasonably well in terms of performance. And they also had a PD-1 PGF beta. So back to that story—um— by specifics, potentially giving us a much more um, a better opportunity to get drugs that previously, I mean, TGF-beta, I think a lot of people remember as a drug that GlaxoSmithKline had in license that didn't work out. And it's been generally viewed as something that, as this monotherapy or as a single antibody, is likely to be more toxic. Here, toxicity was well managed and it showed some very interesting Um, data in a trial that they presented. Early stage, as Chris said, we have to remember that. But the tox profile seemed a lot more manageable, if not downright easy, relatively speaking, in a cancer setting.\n\n00:43:22,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n than you would have expected. So that gives them another interesting bite at a different molecule. So that's like the resurgence of insight from what we're on. seeing from these assets and that was quite Quite pleasing to see.\n\n00:43:37,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n And lastly, back to Tidget. I'm going to just cover the Tidget really quickly. We have some data from Arcus. which, um, I'll have to say, was, um, you know, was good. So this was Arcus and Gilead's phase two edge gastric trial and, um, it was this is Dom Vanelli, Maba, plus an anti-PD1, uh, Zimborelli, oh god, so Don Zim, okay and chemo, and they showed pretty good efficacy, promising efficacy in first-line gastric cancer, which is a reasonably sized market. That's a TIGIT. Remember, this is an FC-inactivated TIGIT. And then of course, we also saw data from AstraZeneca.\n\n00:44:23,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n For teragolamab from the Artemido 1 trial, not teragolamab, that one's failed, that's Roche, sorry, from Rilvogostomic, which is a bispecific PD-1 digit. And that's showing some very interesting data. This was non-small cell lung cancer data. And I've done some numbers around it and compared it to Keynote 042.\n\n00:44:47,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I have to say, in both below 50% and above 50% PD-L1 patients, the response rates look pretty good. But again, we need the phase 3 data to show us that this really works. And as I said, Astra has really put its weight behind this with, I think, the last time I looked, unless some of the trials have been cancelled or not, but about 8,000 patients in the totality of these trials with ribagustamic. So that's some confidence in this agent.\n\n00:45:18,030 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And I, you know, just Arcus, you know, I'm looking at when they do these full data sets at an ESMO. The stock had run up like almost 50 percent over the last month and had grown, you know, doubled over, you know, the last year or so. And so it seems that people were anticipating that, you know, Arcus. I'm just trying to dissect how the stocks react. At a conference like ESMO or are these already dialed in for the most part? I didn't follow every name that would be biotech that would actually move on presentations, but any comments on kind of what you saw in terms of market reaction?","char_start":42204,"char_end":45713,"start_time":"00:42:18","end_time":null}

I didn't follow every name that would be biotech that would actually move on presentations, but any comments on kind of what you saw in terms of market reaction?\n\n00:45:55,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, no, so I mean, look, I think so many people have given up on Tidget than anything that's positive. Um, so it's a little bit like the PD-1 VEGF. So there's always people who go, 'No, it won't work.' Basically, you go around talking to most physicians. They go, 'I'm not sure if I, if, for instance, even if I've got approved, I would probably use it in some patients.' And then you look at the data and it looks great. And then you go and speak to people about digit. No, that's not going to work. And then you look at the data and the data looks good. I think Arcus, in this setting with Gilead, they just have to end up going and prove that this does the job that it's expected to do. Remembering that Astra makes the case that you need to be biospecific. Arcus and Gilead are saying, no, you don't. We just do a single, an antibody to TGIT and an antibody to PD-1 and PD-L1, and we'll be fine. So that's going to be quite interesting to see how that pans out. But you know, as I said, I'm a fan of digit and I think it's um And Arcus and Gilead have both continued with this.\n\n00:46:57,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n Neither of them have given up. And this looks pretty decent. Gastric cancer. I think the share price is reflecting that some people are beginning to believe it. Yep, yeah.\n\n00:47:07,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, well, I'm going to go through some of the data readouts that we had this week that were non-oncology, non-presentations at ESMO. And Brian, I'm going to ask you to comment on the first three here if you have any comments on any of these. But two of them were. were negative and one of them was positive.\n\n00:47:23,850 [SPEAKER_0]\n So I'll go through them. The first one was Elektor. An elector had a dementia drug clinical study read out. This is a [Anybody], and I'm going to butcher this too, Sam. You want anybody named? Let's toast it. Latozinumab. But it's targeting the sordaline receptor for dementia. They have a partnership with GSK in code developing this. and they looked at over 100 patients with frontotemporal dementia. This is a genetic-based target in the progranulin gene. They hit their endpoint on a co-primary of the biomarker. of progranulin protein in the blood. but failed on the clinical component of the co-primary endpoint, which was slowing disease progression on kind of the battery tests they use for dementia. And they also failed to demonstrate any benefit on the other secondary or exploratory endpoints that are often part of these studies to really look at everything. um And so. You know, again, this speaks to the challenge a little bit— like accepting biomarkers without correlative or concordance on the clinical benefit.\n\n00:48:31,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n So this is one where they say, 'Hey, it did what we said it was going to do,' and we're seeing it on the biomarker, but we just didn't see the clinical benefit play through. They do have another antibody partnered with GSK. And it's targeting the same gene, but it has a longer half-life, and that's going to be reading out for a phase 2 study in early Alzheimer's that's expected to read out in the first half of next year. So we'll see how that plays out.\n\n00:48:57,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n But the stock was off 50% on this news, electric stock. And also, this is coming off a year ago. They had another drug targeting TREM2 that was a failed study in Alzheimer's where they laid off employees.\n\n00:49:13,280 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, you know, basically, besides being off 50%, they announced layoffs of half. half of their employees while they await the results from this other.","char_start":45413,"char_end":49314,"start_time":"00:45:55","end_time":null}

So Elector was one of these companies that is using a novel technology that binds to a unique region of the transferrin receptor. And this has been among a number of companies that people have been excited about this brain shuttle. or brain carrier technology to shuttle these. Uh drugs across the blood-brain barrier, uh, and so again, this is, you know, left the CNS base more excited, so again, another failure here for one of these transferrin receptor shuttling technologies to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The second data readout was a positive one. This was Ventix. uh, cardiovascular data with an NLRP3 target. This is a class that has gained a lot of attention. It's kind of anti-inflammatory. drug for both cardiometabolic and neurological indications. Sanofi has a right of first negotiation on this drug.\n\n00:50:24,820 [SPEAKER_0]\n And this data set should trigger that. and we'll see if Sanofi acts. Interestingly, Sanofi acted on another rofen. Actually, one of our companies in the type 1 diabetes space has Sanofi with a rofen. But they had a rope in on Vigil Neurosciences in the neurology space. Um, again, which this drug could have some applicability to this was a drug for Alzheimer's which they acted on that rofen earlier this year. And this drug also has completed a Phase II biomarker trial in early Parkinson's disease with positive data. So there could be some synergies there with Sanofi. So again, the stock was up almost doubling on that news. And then the other data readout was Arcturus. And this was a failed trial, although the results were mixed.\n\n00:51:18,860 [SPEAKER_0]\n This was for CF. It was an mRNA inhaled. Uh therapy. And the stock was down over 50%.\n\n00:51:27,220 [SPEAKER_0]\n Even more so, but rebounded because they were elucidating the idea that they're going to continue to move forward. So basically, they did a small study. And again, rare disease. Looking at six patients just over four weeks. And it did show restoration again on the biomarker on the CFTR protein. So it showed mechanistically that the drug's working— through its intended mechanism— but the clinical data on the key lung function, FEV, this is forced expiratory velocity, did not meaningfully improve. So again, the stock was down over 50% on the news. But the company showed some subset analyses in their press release. They showed four of six patients had mucus plug reduction. They had some imaging analysis that they revealed. And, you know, more importantly, they are looking at six additional patients at a 50% higher dose. They looked at 10 milligrams dose in this study. They're looking at a 15. milligram dose with an additional six patients.\n\n00:52:29,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n And they say they have plans for a larger 20 patient study that is going to look at a longer duration of treatment, 12 weeks instead of four weeks. And that's going to begin enrolling in the first half of next year. The thing I like about this is that we're, this is.\n\n00:52:47,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n indicative of the activity in investing and also a pharma interest in just non-oncology and these other therapeutic areas. We had, you know, here's, you know, one's an antibody, one's a small molecule, one's an inhaled mRNA, and you've got, you know, CNS represented here, you've got cardiovascular represented, you've got rare pulmonary represented, and these are all areas that have heated up. In recent years, for interest in pharma, and so again, not all these readouts are positive— you know, two of the programs are continuing to move forward, one with positive data. So overall, again, it's just encouraging to see. Coming out of ESMO, that there's just a lot of activity across these other therapeutic categories.\n\n00:53:32,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm going to speak about Moderna in a minute, but Brian, any thoughts on just these readouts? And again, this is what I was saying up earlier: the stock movement is pretty robust on some of these.

Uh, maybe surprises on the upside or downside, but any comments on any of these data readouts?\n\n00:53:48,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n I would just kind of generally say I like your point on sort of the diversity of both the different indications and different mechanisms. You know, you look at the Elector GSK failure and look— I mean, this is this is an evolving space where we're seeing more and more. Action in in trying to get drugs to hit targets across the blood-brain barrier obviously has been a number of companies specifically gone public on sort of that platform hypothesis. And, you know, it reminds me a lot of like the beta amyloid history, right? Like solanuzumab was targeting amyloid, but it didn't really cross the. Blood-brain barrier effectively and totally failed. Study after study showed it could have an impact on sort of blood amyloid, but you know it was not hitting plaque itself. You know, we saw the evolution of drugs getting better and better at getting across that blood-brain barrier to target plaque. And now, you know, we have two drugs that do that, you know, effectively and have led to improved clinical outcomes, even though I think people are disappointed versus what the hope originally was. But I think this is the sector, right?\n\n00:54:50,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n You're working through a process to get better and better.\n\n00:54:55,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, identifying targets. CNS is a very hard area to really understand the pathophysiology and certainly to get to the target. And, you know, the mRNA-CF study is similar. We've seen a lot of attempts to get delivery of mRNA, well, not just to the lungs, but even systemically. For broader protein expression that have not been successful. But companies are continuing, right? Like you think, you know, 20 years ago, everyone was knocking like Alnylam and RNAi and how difficult it was to really get proof of concept. And now, you know, we're sort of there and it's hit prime time. So, you know, I think these things will eventually get there. They take time. You know, specifically pick the stocks that are going to do it. So, you know, it's a little bit disappointing that we're not there yet, but, you know, they'll keep trying and they will get there eventually.\n\n00:55:41,450 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah. And speaking of mRNA, so Moderna had another readout, their CMV. A vaccine failed their phase three. This was a study that failed in women aged 16 to 40. This is the most common infectious cause of birth defects. uh uh you know um and so that study they previously announced that they weren't seeing enough cases in an interim interim analysis which had the market kind of handicapping this study And it was perceived to have a low probability of reading out positively. So it wasn't too much of a surprise that it was a negative readout. But they are also ending the development in congenital CMV as a result of this study failure. But they are continuing with the CMV study. With the same mRNA drug in bone marrow transplant patients. The company described it really as a completely different goal in preventing reactivation. Of CMV during immunosuppression since most of these patients either have CMV when they go into transplant or they get it during the transplant. So they think they have a higher problem.\n\n00:56:41,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of reading out positively in the transplant population. But again, with mRNA headwinds that we've seen, you know, these, you know, one with mixed results and one failure, again, as Brian said, you know, it's gonna take some time to to truly develop these more favorably for other applications. And Moderna has really, you know, re-highlighted their cancer applications for this. Sam, any other comments on mRNA technology?\n\n00:57:10,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Just to add, I think where we've seen success has been in the respiratory space. And I'll be specific because in respiratory disease, such as COVID, RSV, flu, I think it's because it's seasonal and you give it right at the right moment, at least for an antibody. And then, of course, for the T cell response. So I just wonder whether in these chronic infections like HPV, et cetera, this technology might have a tougher time. I don't know. I really need to see. Sit back and think it through and talk to a few.","char_start":53122,"char_end":57607,"start_time":"00:53:48","end_time":null}

So just it— just made me start worrying about whether the CMB readout is is something to do with with that issue. And that's the only thing I would add. But now I think they're slowly trying to make themselves more of a cancer company. And of course, the difference here with BioNTech is BioNTech's gone into a whole variety of places with antibodies and ADCs, bispecifics, et cetera.\n\n00:58:14,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, they're not sticking to its guns with mRNA. And I think the proof of the pudding will be in 26 and 27 as the data starts to flow out. Excellent.\n\n00:58:23,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Alright. Well, look, we're at the time. I want to thank both of my co-hosts. You know, it's harder with three. We all have to do a lot more talking and cover. More data, but I thank you both for kind of managing through the hour on that.

I'm Daphne Zohar and my co-hosts today are Bruce Booth, Eric Schmidt, Yaron Werber, Brian Scorny, and Sam Fazelli. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen to the most recent So, after years of underperformance, biotech has been rallying and it looks like it may be more sustainable this time. We've had some solid fundamentals, strong clinical data. Fewer weak players. Renewed M &A activity, and importantly, successful commercial launches by biotechs. The number of companies trading below their cash value has dropped from greater than 200 three years ago to about 50 now, according to Stifel. And layoffs across biotech in 2025 have already exceeded last year's total, which— To some extent, I mean— it's sad, but it also shows discipline and a calling of weak programs.\n\n00:01:07,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n Biotech M &A is on track for its strongest year since 2019 and concerns about policy seem to be settling down a bit. The IPO market seems to still be pretty much closed. But Yaron, you mentioned you're seeing more generalist interest.\n\n00:01:26,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n You're on mute.\n\n00:01:28,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n There we go. Hopefully.\n\n00:01:30,900 [SPEAKER_2]\n So we've been marketing a lot and Eric and Brian and everybody chime in. And especially, we were in Europe last week. We did a lot of events this week. And the generalist interest is definitely much more palpable and it's back. And we do need to maybe be very specific. That specifically in Europe, as you know, our GenX has been added to the Euro 50 at a 1% weighting, which is actually fairly sizable. So we got— investors coming in to meetings because they wanted to talk about organics and that inevitably flows into things like an ionis or a general sort of sector discussion. And in some cases, people came in to see biotech analysts because they were obviously planning on investing more in pharma. But even in the US, we're beginning to see small-cap generalists— kind of dabbling in in very specific names. We are in our conferences have been seeing some generalists that you know, friends we haven't seen in a while coming up to us, you know, giving a hug and saying, 'It's time to kind of at least close my short in healthcare So that's a compliment and we'll take it.\n\n00:02:42,940 [SPEAKER_4]\n That's funny. So what kinds of companies are drawing attention at this point?\n\n00:02:50,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, in large-cap, people are looking at more kind of growth-y names. So I would say, like Energenics, UCB that one of my colleagues, Stacey Kuh, covers very well.\n\n00:03:02,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n People have been looking at Alnylam, specifically in our coverage universe, also smaller IONIS, that's a little bit more diversified commercial company. So that's kind of what we're saying and I'd love to see what everybody else is saying.\n\n00:03:16,679 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I'd love to go to Bruce. You know, we were having a fun conversation earlier this week about predictions for the XBI. I think it was at about 112 today. Do you think this rally is sustainable and what are your thoughts on the IPO market?\n\n00:03:30,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yep. I think you summed it up well. There's a lot of tailwinds behind us right now. And I think, after multiple years of retrenchment, you know, it's ready for the cycle to turn. I think, as generalists come back, I think that's going to be a real momentum builder for the sector. In terms of companies, the reality is the IPO process takes, by the time you org up to get a confidential offering to flip public, that can be many months, three plus months in the process. So the fact is, the markets didn't really feel very good. Until maybe September, things had gone up in the summer, but I don't think people thought it was sustainable. I think now it feels like this is real.\n\n00:04:16,459 [SPEAKER_0]\n I wouldn't anticipate a huge amount of IPO activity before the end of the year, just given the fact that it takes you four months to sort of file, especially with a closed system. You know, all of that process. I do think the first couple months of 2026 look like they could be, you know, pretty interesting.","char_start":0,"char_end":4317,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

You know, all of that process. I do think the first couple months of 2026 look like they could be, you know, pretty interesting.\n\n00:04:36,480 [SPEAKER_0]\n The bigger question for the sector is how many IPOs should we have and what type of company should be going public? Because being public, as I mentioned in the sort of 20-year blog post, it is really not for everyone. And, you know, I've been a part of companies where you sort of quickly regret being public because solving. R&D questions, especially early stage R&D questions under the glare of the public markets, is not a pleasant place. Probably costs you $40 or $50 million to be public for your first two years when you think about bankers' fees, D&O, and all of the other issues. If you can stay private, I'd encourage people to just stay private. But if you need to access the bigger pool of capital, I think it will likely open up in the beginning of next year.\n\n00:05:22,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I want to point out that Bruce put out a terrific series with his learnings over the past 20 years in biotech investing, and we will post that here in the room. And we'll talk about some of the themes throughout the show. But I think it's a really good point. And, you know, the other side of it, one argument for going public would be if you are public on the back of a positive milestone.\n\n00:05:48,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n It might be easier to raise additional capital and also. kind of get true value for the programs that you have. But I also agree with everything you just said about how difficult it is to be a public company CEO.\n\n00:06:04,850 [SPEAKER_4]\n When you're managing data readouts. It's probably one of the most stressful things that you could be doing.\n\n00:06:11,409 [SPEAKER_3]\n Definitely, just on this point.\n\n00:06:15,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Our friend Adam Furstein did a very interesting interview with Neil Kumar of Bridge Bio yesterday. That's on the podcast.\n\n00:06:25,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n Five ten minutes where it's worth listening to because he echoes exactly what you just said with regards to how tough it is to be a public biotech sometimes, but then you need the money to do the work that you need to do so that's that's the dilemma.\n\n00:06:39,390 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and I think I remember.\n\n00:06:41,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n One time, Neil had a major readout. It was, I think, his phase three readout. And he was talking about the Odyssey. He was putting out some posts on there, very philosophical, but it's true. It is very stressful. It's also really fun.\n\n00:06:56,929 [SPEAKER_4]\n and satisfying when you're able to get a good result.\n\n00:07:00,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n So just one additional comment on that of trying to stay private. If you just look at the frequency of $100 million plus financings in the private market, it's like six or seven a month right now. So there is actually a lot of venture activity. It may be concentrating in fewer names, but there is a lot of venture funding available for companies that want to get through that clinical inflection as a private company today.\n\n00:07:28,690 [SPEAKER_5]\n I feel like we've seen this movie before, though, right?\n\n00:07:32,530 [SPEAKER_5]\n Know when the generals do come in, when the rising tide lifts all ships. It is very hard to hold back on IPOs. Of course, generally speaking, I don't think venture guys are incentivized to do it. I don't think bankers are incentivized. I don't think we, as analysts, are incentivized to do it. Do you think this will be different? Do you think there will be some gates on the system?\n\n00:07:53,170 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think everybody is incentivized to go public. It's actually the discipline to not go public. If you're the management team, when you go public, not only do you have a stock option plan, a 10B5 plan, but you lift all of the liquidation preference off your shoulders from an M&A side of things. It's a private company. The VCs think that they're getting a path to liquidity, so they're pushing for it. The bankers love it. I mean, 7% of every IPO, if you can just keep cashing those coupons, that's a pretty nice business. And of course, that gives you guys a lot of work on a bunch of new names. So I think everybody's incentivized to.\n\n00:08:32,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n Oh, Bruce, you're breaking up.","char_start":4019,"char_end":8472,"start_time":"00:04:36","end_time":null}

The discipline of knowing not to do it.\n\n00:08:39,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, who's going to exert that discipline? I mean, where is the check and balance in the system?\n\n00:08:44,990 [SPEAKER_5]\n Or we could just, you know, unfortunately, at the perils of the market again.\n\n00:08:50,540 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, it is a cycle after all.\n\n00:08:53,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, and there's some discipline, I think, when you get to the point of price discovery and the existing investors being somewhat sensitive to dilution, so they want to go public, but then they probably also want to offset dilution. This is another I think important theme that you mentioned, Bruce, in your series. This idea that how important it is that the CEO is aligned with its current, with his or her current shareholders.\n\n00:09:20,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n And there is a tendency sometimes to look at the future shareholders, but that was a really, I thought, very interesting point you made there.\n\n00:09:28,700 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no, it's a crucial one as you're weighing questions around, do I go public? Do I sell now? Do I take the kind of dilution that might be required in the public markets at low prices? All of those are real. I'm usually the current shareholder in all those conversations, rather than a new and future shareholder or future investor. And so I come at it from maybe a slightly different perspective than a new generalist might.\n\n00:09:56,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and then you know, I think everybody would love to see an outcome like what we just saw this week with avidity. So we started The week with exciting news that Novartis will acquire Avidity. For $12 billion. Seems like everybody was happy with that deal. Let's start with Brian and then go to Eric to talk about the deal and also any implications for other companies like Dyne, for example.\n\n00:10:23,890 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, great, Daphne. Yes, so as you said, a $12 billion deal for Avidity announced this week. And this was speculated going back all the way into the summer. I mean, you look at the chart, there's a big jump in Avidity's stock price as it was rumored to be an acquisition candidate for Novartis. I mean, stocks had a tremendous run this year. And look, so Avidity— you know— they're really a platform company with three discrete assets. And, you know, what they're really focused on is sort of delivering oligonucleotides directly to muscle. And they do have another platform that's getting spun back out that's more cardiovascular targeted. But I think the big focus and certainly all the clinical candidates are on the muscle targeting platform. And that is what Novartis is paying for. Um, and they sort of have two parallel lead programs— one in um DMD, but a discrete subgroup of DMD patients, exon 44 amenable patients, and DM1, which is probably the bigger driver of investor focus here. And they have a plan to file the DMD program with the FDA in the very near future.\n\n00:11:31,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n And we're looking to see pivotal data from their DM1 program in 2026.\n\n00:11:40,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n And they're planning to file for that. Uh, right on the back of that. And DM1 is a really big indication. I cover Dyn and these two companies are very much viewed by investors.\n\n00:11:53,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n Very similar, and you know, I would argue— like the individual nuances and Bruce— feel free to jump in to agree with me here. But I think times DM1 drugs is a little better than Avidity's, but they're a little behind Avidity too. And one of the knocks is that Avidity has this much larger— a phase three study— than the Dine study.","char_start":8172,"char_end":12107,"start_time":"00:08:32","end_time":null}

And one of the knocks is that Avidity has this much larger— a phase three study— than the Dine study.\n\n00:12:13,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's more of an expansion cohort of a phase two study. But they'll both potentially be reviewed in somewhat parallel by the FDA. And look, I've sort of really liked the valuation discount between Avidity and Dyn. And Dyn was up almost as much as Avidity was on a percentage basis when this announcement came earlier this week. Week. So, you know, definitely going to be an interesting area to follow as these two platforms and individual drugs move forward and ultimately now. Dine's competing with Novartis, and we'll see if someone else winds up picking up Dine. But, you know, I definitely think if you're Novartis, and this was a pretty – seems like it was probably a – competitive bid to drive up to $12 billion, one of the largest development stage deals in the history of the sector. It'll be interesting when we get merger docs. You know, it's really hard to look at an avidity and not also consider a dime because they are so similar, both in terms of the platform and the individual programs that they have. But I love to hear Eric's thoughts on that.\n\n00:13:17,579 [SPEAKER_5]\n Maybe one comment, just picking up on your last valuation comment. I think this is the largest deal we've ever seen for a company that has yet to read out a phase three result. I mean, that's quite remarkable here, right? $12 billion.\n\n00:13:31,920 [SPEAKER_5]\n For a company that is seeding all the developmental risk, the commercial risk, the clinical risk, Novartis. Now we know Novartis loves RNA therapeutics and Sam may want to touch on that. But this is unprecedented in that we have a company.\n\n00:13:47,630 [SPEAKER_5]\n That's being valued at this level that has really yet to prove that it has a drug. Now, I've been a big fan. This is a wonderful call for us. Um, Daphne to your comment, you know, is everyone happy? Actually, you know, I could argue that it's a mixed bag for Ividi shareholders. Sure, it's been a good run. Sure, it's a hefty premium in the mid 40s for a company that already had good performance prior to the deal. But Avidity was one of the few companies, maybe with Dyn, that really has a platform, has an opportunity to have. A renewable pipeline has the opportunity to be first and best in class in multiple very substantial markets. When you think of the biotech sector and know where the next down the island where the next vertex might come from— It's going to come from a company like Avidity or Dynes. We are giving up that potential for a $20, $30, $40 billion valuation in the future. When a company like Avidity chooses to sell out at this stage.\n\n00:14:48,060 [SPEAKER_5]\n Again, they're seeing a lot of risk over to Novartis. But this is one of the few, I think, that had the ability to be— a renewable pipeline, a real all-star in our business.\n\n00:14:59,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and it's one of the changes that we've seen, I think, in the sector that biotechs are able to launch drugs successfully, and there is that you know, even the decision of the trade-off. In looking at M&A at this stage of a company. So those were great points. Actually, I'd love to hear from Sam on your thoughts from a Novartis perspective on this deal.\n\n00:15:23,110 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, sure. I mean, just to the point of the takeout, at the end of the day, pharma companies are supposed to go and take out good companies like this. That's when the investors in the pharma side celebrate as opposed to something which they cannot get. Their head around, which we will get to because there's another M &A story that we'll talk about later. So I know it's a bittersweet pill for my biotech friends, but the issue is that these are the good companies that are going to be the attractive ones with assets that make a difference to the future patent portfolio. issues that some of these pharma companies have. So as the guy said.\n\n00:16:03,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n The RNA targeting type assets, Novartis already knows quite a bit about them. It's got to deal with.","char_start":11807,"char_end":16099,"start_time":"00:12:13","end_time":null}

It's got to deal with.\n\n00:16:10,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n Annihilum. with a drug on the market and a deal with Ionis with the drug in development, both targeted cardiovascular diseases. And it's also got a business and understands treat. difficult to treat muscle diseases with spinal muscular atrophy, for instance. So this really fits very well with Novartis' knowledge base, at least, and understanding of manufacturing and getting these things underway into the market. Of course, the company needs a product or a suite of products to replace what has turned out to be not the biggest drug in the world, because currently that has apparently officially been approved as Zepan or Monviaro. Uh, this quarter, but the consent takes— which is for skin diseases, autoimmune skin diseases—have a heading to about 7. 8 billion revenue in 2028, and then of course, after that, there is a risk of patent expiration.\n\n00:17:12,140 [SPEAKER_3]\n The compound pattern expires in 2028 and 2029. And therefore, if you look at consensus, growth was flat from 29 onwards, or there was no growth. So this fits perfectly. It gives you a product in a sweet spot that the company understands at a timeframe that is great for the company.\n\n00:17:32,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, Novartis. What I'd love to hear is the Western put somebody on on the on Twitter saying that their technology is passe. I don't know if that's true or not, but I'd love to hear from Um Brian and and and Eric in terms of the understanding of where the tech platform is. Is it, is it already become commoditized like a whole bunch of people out there already have these type of targeting games? And since targeting drugs?\n\n00:18:00,480 [SPEAKER_5]\n I really haven't heard that at all. I think that both Dinah and Biddy were smart. And first and quick. At promoting this platform. I'm sure you'll see more come on board. There are other ways to target—such as— to the muscle, but none of them are as proven as TFR.\n\n00:18:13,699 [SPEAKER_5]\n Antibody-mediated uptake. So I'm sure it's on the come, but the lead time that these two companies have on the field is tremendous.\n\n00:18:23,300 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah. So and one thing that struck me about this deal— and in general over the last few months— is how well women CEOs have been doing on M &A this year with some of the biggest deals being women-led companies.\n\n00:18:36,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n So, for example, we have Sarah and Avidity, $ 12 billion. Uh, Sharon, mates, and intracellular. They sold that company to J & J, $14. 6 billion. Kate and Blueprint, $9. 5 billion sale to Sanofi, Heather Turner. Laura Shaver, Sophie Kornowski, Jill Milne. Ivana Libish, and then of course, you've got Al Nilem and Yvonne. Vertex and Reshma. So it's interesting. I actually see here Julia Owens, who is one of the biotech CEO sisterhood founders. There's now 400 women. CEOs in the sisterhood. And I think it's good. It's good to see.\n\n00:19:15,860 [SPEAKER_5]\n That's better than good. That's amazing. Congrats to all the women, successful or not this year, for making it to that role.\n\n00:19:24,570 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, it's a change from what the industry looked like. Five years ago, ten years ago, it's just a real, real shift. And this kind of success and pattern recognition, I think, is really good for the next generation of leaders.\n\n00:19:39,220 [SPEAKER_4]\n So we had some drama this week with Novo making an unexpected bid to acquire Mitzera, aiming to outbid Pfizer, who had a $7. 3 billion deal in place. Which included $4. 9 billion upfront and $2. 4 billion in milestone payments.","char_start":15799,"char_end":19650,"start_time":"00:16:03","end_time":null}

Which included $4. 9 billion upfront and $2. 4 billion in milestone payments.\n\n00:19:55,290 [SPEAKER_4]\n Novo launched a surprise counteroffer of up to $9 billion, including $6. 5 billion in equity and $2. 5 billion in contingent value rights. One key piece of the Novo deal is that it de-risks the upfront payment for Metzera through a dividend. Mitzera's board says that NOVA's offer is a superior proposal and has notified Pfizer, triggering a four-day window for Pfizer to respond or improve its bid. I haven't seen if there's anything that's happened on that. But Pfizer was not happy about this at all. Calling Novo's bid reckless and unprecedented, accusing it of trying to suppress competition and violate antitrust laws. And Pfizer also claims Mitzera cannot legally exit the existing agreement and is prepared to pursue legal actions. And someone also mentioned that Borla is pulling out his Trump card. No pun intended, by mentioning that Novo is not domiciled in America. So Sam, what are your thoughts on how this is likely to play out?\n\n00:20:52,850 [SPEAKER_3]\n But congrats, Stephanie, on a brilliant trump card that you just played.\n\n00:20:58,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n No, look, the thing is that we all sat there as this news came out at first because there was, I think it was a Bloomberg or somebody broke it and about not long after the actual announcement came out. And we thought, oh, that can't be true because it just doesn't make much sense, at least on paper. So you start then scratching your head thinking, how are you going to make this make sense? So let me take a whole bunch of different sides here. On the side of Metzera.\n\n00:21:23,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n I find it interesting that they say it's a superior deal because there is a real uh competition, FTC risk here in terms of this not happening and going on for six months, 12 months, 18 months. And I don't know how, what kind of discount you put on that risk to apply to the sweetened bid, if you like. It was not a sweetened bid. It would be Pfizer. But the deal is bigger than what Pfizer was offering.\n\n00:21:53,350 [SPEAKER_3]\n So there's that angle that I thought they can't just go, but maybe the fiduciary duty of management is to look at the actual facts and go, well, this are the numbers. Basis makes a lot more sense. So that's what they're doing. But if I were in their shoes, and I am not in their shoes, and these are serious senior pharma and biotech people, I'm sure they've looked at everything with their advisors. Now, the four days for Pfizer— i suppose expires at the end because it's four business days at the end of Tuesday. So let's see what Pfizer does. Certainly not enough time to get any involvement from the administration or anything like that, I suppose, unless the president stops. decides to step in. What's interesting here also it's not— it's novo. Right, you know, you have that background stuff going on. I don't want to link them. I just want to remind people, with regards to Greenland and Denmark, etc in the background, right. So, maybe this gives the administration sufficient reason to kind of say something.","char_start":19350,"char_end":22698,"start_time":"00:19:39","end_time":null}

So, maybe this gives the administration sufficient reason to kind of say something.\n\n00:22:55,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't know. We'll find out. But in basic numbers, the deal. On the per share front, is 19 better. Enterprise value is about 22 better, because of the way the CVR works in the maps that we've done. But we know it's a better deal in terms of price. The question is, can they actually get it done? There's too much overlap here. And I know Jeroen wants to talk about this too. But in terms of the overlap, and what is it saying about Novo? I'll save my little piece and then I'll pass it on to your own. But in terms of one possibility is Novo wants to scupper the deal. I don't know why would you go through all of this to make Pfizer pay a billion or two billion more. I don't see them. And what difference does that make to Pfizer? Then you've got the situation story here that maybe Nova actually needs it. And the story is that apparently they were one of the bidders. They just weren't high enough, or that the company assumed that there was too much risk associated with the deal because of the overlap. Which of course hasn't changed. Now, Novo going in here, saying we're structuring the deal in such a way that it shouldn't trigger a competition issue.\n\n00:24:02,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n Or an issue with the antitrust side, is actually saying that there's actually an antitrust side. So we have an antitrust colleague at Bloomberg who looked at this and said, 'I just can't see any way that this can escape it because the FTC doesn't have to ever be actually even notified. They can just look at any deal. and go to go to town on it right go to war on it. So there's that element. After all that, so why is NOBA doing it, assuming it's not any of these other things? Okay, so a lot of people said maybe it's because it's internal pipeline.\n\n00:24:38,570 [SPEAKER_3]\n That's coming up, Tagrisema, which is a dual chamber, at least in the first instance, GLP-1 amylin is not good enough, or is going to have a tough time on the market, and they believe that the drugs out of Metzera are better. And there is data coming out of Metzera that potentially suggests that. The next thing could be that Metzeler is able to go once monthly. Although we have to see some more data on that, especially on the tolerability side, which the companies may have been able to see. So is this signaling, and this is where I'm going to pass to Jero, that Novo has lost confidence in its own? Up-and-coming drugs. If that's the case, then they've made a mistake here. Frankly, because they're going to end up, if they don't get the deal, with even more questions on their pipeline in the future.\n\n00:25:33,600 [SPEAKER_2]\n Over well, so let me. Let me maybe pick it up. A couple of things pop into mind. First of all, we know Novo's in trouble. They've essentially vacated the entire board. The foundation essentially took over and they've already replaced a lot of the management. Which is sort of what's striking here is with a completely new board, albeit again, clearly it is being orchestrated by the foundation behind the scenes.\n\n00:25:59,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n To get a new board to sign off on something like this, and you obviously have a brand new CEO too. This is not things that are trivial at the board level, and Bruce, you know, chime in as well. So that, to me, was fairly striking, but unquestionably, they are signaling that Kegri Sama is not going to cut it, and that's not shocking to anybody.\n\n00:26:21,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n The potency of the amylin is weaker. It's not long-acting. They had some trouble with their clinical studies, the way the dosing worked, and dropouts. They've lost their edge and their lead, and they're not long-acting. And Metzera's pipeline, in that sense, and that's what we think was also interesting for Pfizer. It's actually one company that actually has a broader toolset. That Pfizer saw as attractive as a way to really get it in the size into obesity and be relevant.\n\n00:26:54,380 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah.\n\n00:26:55,830 [SPEAKER_4]\n One other thing, going back to sort of the deal structure.","char_start":22398,"char_end":26739,"start_time":"00:22:55","end_time":null}

I was thinking of Illumina and Grail. That was one. I don't know if you have any, if anybody can think of others.\n\n00:27:18,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n Back in the days, I'm dating myself. Boston Scientific. Um, Saint Jude and Matronic remember that that was quite the saga.\n\n00:27:26,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n Mm hmm.\n\n00:27:28,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, well, let's move to policy. Brian, can you talk about the Indiana Catalan plant news and its potential implications?\n\n00:27:38,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n Oh, yeah, sure. So I think we've talked about this a bunch, but and I don't want to overbeat a dead horse here. But, you know, this cattle in Indiana situation just seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. And it's funny that amidst all the bullishness that we're talking about in the sector, this is sort of emerged as one of the major headwinds or certainly a question I get very, very frequently. From investors across all companies, what level of exposure do my companies have to Camel and Indiana? So, you know, this is a facility, one of the largest GMP manufacturing facilities for pharma. A lot of companies outsource, um, to cattle and um, you know, this was a facility that really started like ramping up um production during COVID. You know, I think there's a little bit of looking back and blaming the sort of mandates to ramp up production as maybe leading to some of the problems here. But, you know, over the last year, you know, they've started receiving Form 483s from the FDA.\n\n00:28:40,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n Two weeks ago, they got an official action indication. Classification, which is the most severe regulatory notification that a manufacturing facility can get, and it's really kind of bled into a lot of concerns. You know, I think the most exposed names have very clearly been like Scholarock and Regeneron, both companies who have wound up receiving complete responses. Just due to the cattle in Indiana facility and the CMC issues that are going on here. You know, it's funny, we, you know, we spend so much time. I'm kind of thinking of the clinical development pathway and regulatory pathway on whether a drug is efficacious and safe. CMC kind of takes a backseat in investors' minds a lot, but it's really emerged here as a big headache to the sector. I don't remember. You know, a time where there's been such a broad impact, you know, maybe the Genzyme. Olsen landing problems 15 years ago, but that was still pretty Genzyme specific here.\n\n00:29:42,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, we had a company out on the road this week that's development stage and literally every single meeting we had, investors asked, do you have any exposure to cattle in Indiana? So, you know, it's certainly been an interesting thing to watch. Regeneron reported earlier this week, and they're trying to resolve some of those issues to get some of their approvals across the board here. But companies are starting to move to other manufacturers to try to get around what's clearly a problem. And if you get a chance to look at the 43s, they're pretty grotesque, it sounds like, the facilities there.\n\n00:30:18,680 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, it's really interesting, especially when it's juxtaposed with the you know, the whole tariff question and moving manufacturing. So like it sort of limits the ability to find alternatives ex-US as people think about that angle of it. I'm curious to hear from Bruce, how are your companies thinking about this?

You know, not only that specific site, but the whole— you know— the collapse of cell manufacturing. You know, all of that has been front and center for for boards and I— share in the upcoming year in review the the data from the 270 CRMs from the summer of FDA rejection letters and it's like 50 of them are manufacturing related. I mean, it's a really big and enormous driver of—uh— downside to not have that wrapped up properly. So very front and center for boards.\n\n00:31:22,370 [SPEAKER_4]\n Wow, that's a huge number.\n\n00:31:24,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n All right. Well, let's talk about data and conferences. So, Intelia Therapeutics. And the liver talks and the impact on the field. Eric, can you take us through that?\n\n00:31:38,570 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, unfortunately, this was not a scheduled conference event. This was something out of the blue. The company announced earlier in the week that they had a Second case of liver. enzyme elevation in this case a high's law associated with their gene edited self gene, their in vivo gene editing based therapy for ATTR.\n\n00:31:59,949 [SPEAKER_5]\n And yeah, this is a doozy. This is a real tough one to deal with.\n\n00:32:06,340 [SPEAKER_5]\n We don't know what caused it. Historically, we've seen some issues with the nanoparticle, the LMP, that's potentially caused liver enzyme elevations. But in this case, the time course is quite unusual. Typically, if you have LNP-mediated toxicity, you see that arise quite early and maybe by day seven or so. It's already on the mend. These cases evolved quite late around day 30 with no warning and— And again, in the case announced this week, it was a highest law case that required the trial to be paused for the company and then subsequently for the FDA to mandate a clinical trial hold.\n\n00:32:47,669 [SPEAKER_5]\n Really tough. I mean, this company to its credit did the right thing. They've already treated a few hundred patients. And done so fairly safely. Um, but uh, this is going to be a tough one to get past. There are other therapies for attr and the benefit, of course, of this drug was that it was supposed to be a little bit more convenient. It wanted lifetime therapy. Um, obviously that has a lot of benefit for patients if you have a clean side effect profile, but it's not going to be clear from here on out necessarily how they go about developing the drug going forward. And then, yeah, this left quite. quite a ripple effect on the field of gene editing, I think.\n\n00:33:27,930 [SPEAKER_5]\n Many of their other competitors, like CRISPR Editas Prime, were all down or are all down on the week as this field needs to deal with yet another case of idiosyncratic toxicity.\n\n00:33:40,950 [SPEAKER_5]\n Not all gene-initiated products are created equal. Some are quite very different indeed, and I'd hope that this doesn't. Poison the well, but just a reminder we need to. Be mindful of side effects with these newer modalities.\n\n00:33:55,090 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yaron, I don't know if you want to add.\n\n00:33:56,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n I just want to mention what was also interesting about this one, and we'll go to Yaron afterwards for additional insights into Intelia. The broader impact, but what was interesting about this one is that the liver tox issue was disclosed. On X so there's like a. An ex-user posted that he had spoken to someone whose relative was enrolled in the clinical trial. This was like a couple days before, I think. Um, and he put it out there that this that this issue was likely to be announced or that it was likely to happen. And it raises the question about an MNPI. He received some significant backlash and, of course, he wasn't under any duty of confidentiality. He learned about it from someone whose daughter was in the clinical. The daughter of someone who's in the clinical study. But, um, the question of risks involved in sharing information that you learn in that manner was raised. So I don't know if anybody wants to comment on that.\n\n00:34:57,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, of course, if anybody else wants to comment about Intelia or the field more generally.","char_start":30111,"char_end":34558,"start_time":"00:30:45","end_time":null}

Do you remember? I honestly didn't look, when did the high law prevail? When did it appear? Was it really quickly or did it come later on because of liver function?\n\n00:35:24,960 [SPEAKER_5]\n No, it was quite a bit— about 30 or so days after infusion.\n\n00:35:28,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n Okay. The one challenge with TTR is there's so many amazing therapies now.\n\n00:35:35,070 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, between the orals, obviously, there's Donzera, which is an auto injector from Ionis, and there's a few. There's eight RX and one more. Private than looking at even I believe called Vista. Also doing a Q3 in six months. Injectable. So the unmet need is fairly kind of small.\n\n00:35:55,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n Since you're talking about Ionis and Argenix, do you want to talk about, you said something about their earnings?\n\n00:36:02,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, so the good news is we are seeing an innovation cycle in biotech. Maybe we'll start with Orogenics, another very strong quarter for VivGuard, continuing to penetrate markets globally for GMG and CIDP. It's really a superb management team.\n\n00:36:21,160 [SPEAKER_2]\n We all take for granted sometimes commercialization, but it's really jarring to see a company perform that well and really execute that well, just given how hard it is these days to really launch drugs that well.\n\n00:36:33,580 [SPEAKER_2]\n Made some moves on their pipeline. Essentially, enrolling patients in dermatomyositis is very hard if you have an IV, and we're seeing that with the Zuckibar from Pfizer.\n\n00:36:44,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n And they decided to halt enrollment in their phase two for their second pipeline product in DM because it just wasn't enrolling well with an IV. Roiva has an oral now that's going to be filed soon and all the other drugs are promising sub-Q. Um, the In the meantime, they were continuing to advance VivGuard in multiple indications. This was ACR week, so there was a lot going on in Sjogren's, and we saw the data from Novartis for the first time. First time, the phase three, Ionelumab, which is a bath mechanism. And technically, both of those studies were positive, the Neptunus studies, but they sort of got to the finish line. It's like you finish the marathon and you collapse— type thing. The data wasn't very compelling from an efficacy perspective. Vore, which is a public company, has a BAF April. That came from Remagen in China, and they showed their phase three. VOR is now going to do a global study, and that data out of China was really fantastic, showing about a three, three and a half point difference on the relevant scale of SDI versus about half to one point different from Novartis.\n\n00:37:54,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, of course, it was out of China, so there was some chain, some you know, difficulties extrapolating from a Chinese data set to a global data set. But they were starting a phase three. Of course, we saw more of the FCRN data from Vivgard, from Argenix, and Imavi from Imavi, from J&J. They're in phase three, and their phase two data looks identical. And of course, Amgen. In phase three, with their CD4 ligand antagonist for Sjogren's, that's going to read out late next year. Amgen's the only company that actually has positive phase two data in systemic and sympathetic Sjogren's. Sjogren's is a big market. It's like we're estimating 8 to 12 billion. So that's definitely a market to watch.\n\n00:38:33,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n For sure. And then Iona's had a lot of things, but let me turn it back to you.\n\n00:38:38,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I think Eric also wanted to talk about. CAR-T datasets at ACR.\n\n00:38:43,970 [SPEAKER_5]\n Well, yeah, we had the ACR meeting in Chicago this past week. I didn't attend, but my colleague Josh did.

But when you go to a conference like ACR and you see these rooms filled with listeners eagerly awaiting the latest results, it's It's palpable, the enthusiasm for what's going on in the field. I don't know what's going to bridge that gap in sentiment, but the data certainly continue to be. Extremely exciting scleroderma, in particular, has probably been the most difficult rheumatologic disease to treat. It's a disease where patients develop scar tissue throughout their body and there's nothing that can stop the promotion of that disease activity. And yet, now, for the first time, data sets from Cabelletta and Bristol. We're seeing some very favorable activity against the syndication.\n\n00:40:12,280 [SPEAKER_5]\n So there is probably no greater unmet need in the field, and Cartees are packing the punch to get there. I think, though, they come with their complexity. There's no doubt they come with their cost. We've seen businesses being made out of this in oncology. Before we see companies m in these severe rheumatologic disorders as well.\n\n00:40:36,390 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah.\n\n00:40:37,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n Okay, well, we wanted to move to some kind of broader themes. This week, we were talking about policy and just some of the headwinds that companies like Moderna have faced, STAT had an interesting story about Moderna. Their market value has fallen. By more than 90%, it was $185 billion at its 2021 peak. It's now hovering around 10 billion.\n\n00:41:04,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n So, Sam, let's talk a bit about the criticism around them overspending and overestimating sales and the rumors of a large pharma buying them out.\n\n00:41:18,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n Oh I think we lost Sam.\n\n00:41:20,350 [SPEAKER_4]\n While we're waiting to get him back, this. It also struck me as relevant to some of the points from Bruce's trilogy that he put out around lean growth and boards. Yeah, Sam. So did you want to go first or should we? Why don't you go first and then we'll hear from from Bruce.\n\n00:41:38,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n I mean, it's the second time access dropped me today.\n\n00:41:43,400 [SPEAKER_3]\n Look, the company was very focused on keeping the assets that it had, especially the COVID vaccine to itself, BioNTech shared with Pfizer. And so there was an enormous amount of cash that came into the coffers of Moderna over the two, three years where COVID vaccine sales were significant.\n\n00:42:05,509 [SPEAKER_3]\n So what then happened, of course, is that there was a, you know, what I think. Maybe it was over-enthusiasm in committing to large phase three trials.\n\n00:42:16,880 [SPEAKER_3]\n A whole bunch of respiratory disease vaccines and other types of infectious disease vaccines. And then, of course, a significant effort and focus on oncology. But a lot of it, except for the Merck one, which is a 50-50 deal being financed by them. So that, of course, is expensive. So what has happened now is that the company is probably going to end the year this year with about $6 to $6. 5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Um, and you said you know enterprise market cap of about 10 billion. So we got an enterprise value of three, three and a half, and then so what's going on here is I think that if you think about Kovid of vaccinations continuing to decline on an annual basis, it's possible that every year we're going to end up maybe this year at the $1. 5 billion level, maybe next year at $1. 2, $1. 3 billion if that trend continues. And of course, there's only so much cost cutting a company can do with the fact that it's got trials that are going on that it needs to finance, particularly the expanding deal with.","char_start":38400,"char_end":42663,"start_time":"00:39:09","end_time":null}

So what do you end up with is a very rapidly dwindling cash and the risk that they would need to raise money. So here, what does a company do in these sort of circumstances? They've made all those commitments. So a stat said that somebody had approached. Or there's been an approach by a pharma company that could be a takeout or a licensing deal. So we said that we think that a takeout is at the moment unlikely because of the variety of pressures that are on the top line and the bottom line, and I think the jury's still out whether an mRNA vaccine for cancer is genuinely driving a benefit from directing the immune system to the antigens that they're delivering or is doing, what a very nice Nature paper showed, a very broad, nice, innate immune activation, which you get with a COVID shot, which has been my a forever criticism that there should be a control arm in here or at least in the placebo group of an of an unrelated mRNA to prove that\n\n00:44:34,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n what you're doing in these vaccines is delivered from the cancer vaccine. So all this is still uncertainty in my mind. So I'm thinking maybe the best thing that could happen here is that they actually partner out with the infectious disease vaccines, where there is some business, maybe go with the vaccine provider in general. So I don't know what others think. I know your own covers it.\n\n00:44:59,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n Everyone, did you want to comment?\n\n00:45:01,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, that could be very quick. This one, I think, that there was a a big pharma that was anticipated to be in the mix. This one doesn't, wouldn't make a lot of sense. And we could be, you know, 99% wrong on this one.\n\n00:45:17,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n underlying covet business is under threat. Um, Merc has their own sort of BD priorities. We just don't again, we don't want to speak for them. We don't think this is going to be one of them— do have access to the vaccine. And for another pharma to acquire Moderna to get access to technology that's still fairly risky and expensive to maintain, I think is going to be fairly tough. We're skeptical.\n\n00:45:40,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, so there I mean, it's interesting because it was such a strong execution play in terms of like getting a drug to market launching it. In the commercial world, you know, worldwide.\n\n00:45:52,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n Such a success story on one side of it and then, now, it looks pretty dire. But I think Stefan is somebody that people have been skeptical about in the past, and he's pulled things out that have surprised.\n\n00:46:08,279 [SPEAKER_4]\n So we'd love to hear from you, Bruce. You talked a lot about management, boards, you know, scaling, all of that in your trilogy. Do you want to cover, do you want to talk about?\n\n00:46:17,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n That, yeah, I mean, with regard to Moderna, I would just say it's very easy now to sit in the cheap seats of, you know, the Monday morning and I can make comments as to, you know, they, an AOL Time Warner moment, where they had a bigger market cap than Merck and should have used their inflated equity to buy what you might describe as a, or a mainstream business, and diversified off of a pretty risky mRNA platform that certainly was instrumental in saving the world from COVID, but doesn't seem to have lots of hits beyond that.","char_start":42363,"char_end":46026,"start_time":"00:43:25","end_time":null}

I think the lesson is, is when you have a stock price that the board and management team think is, you know, let's just say exuberantly valued, you should take advantage of it. I mean, Lily, at some point, you know, valuation multiples, you could say that they should be much more aggressive about deploying when their price-to-earnings ratio is where it is relative to a BMS. Which sort of brings me to the point of, as all of these wonderful tailwinds happen in our space, when are we going to have you know, the resurgence of big to big mergers. You know, my prediction is that we will see that in the next three plus months. You're going to see large companies in the mid to high double-digit billions being bought or merged with the much larger. I mean, it's amazing the spread between big pharma— from $40 billion to $800 billion today.\n\n00:47:53,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n It'll be interesting to see whether some of those companies leverage their let's just say exuberantly priced equity to buy some other companies.\n\n00:48:02,380 [SPEAKER_4]\n We got to write this down and remember it, come back to it if and when it happens. Uh, so.\n\n00:48:09,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n Any other comments? And then maybe we can dig deeper into your trilogy and some of the themes in there. I thought they were very relevant. And we don't often get a chance on this show to zoom out.\n\n00:48:22,930 [SPEAKER_4]\n Spending the last 10 minutes sort of zooming out, talking about lessons and, and I think that would be very interesting. So let's pause for a second, see if anybody else wants to comment, and then I'll go back to you, Bruce.\n\n00:48:35,529 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just on that M&A thing that Bruce said very, very quickly. I think somebody like Lilly, the decision that they need to make is how sustainable is their top line. In the numbers that we're seeing, you know, this quarter, $10 billion for the JLP1. If that's sustainable, I think that supports an enormous amount of internal R&D to the point that they don't need to do what Moderna should have done when its market cap was 80, 100, or 140 billion. I can't remember how high they went. Who have bought some companies and of course, as Bruce said, I'm definitely one of the reside commentators here because they're not even as close as Bruce's to the market in general. So, but at the end of the day, I think large pharma is doing it. We've just been talking about this. Novartis is doing it. They're not necessarily using their shares. They're using their cheap cash. So it's harder, I think, for the biotechs. But even there, we've seen some. So with GenMab and Oh, gosh, I forget who they took out.\n\n00:49:37,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, yes, that's right. Sorry. So you know, um, so it's happening.\n\n00:49:46,310 [SPEAKER_3]\n Over.\n\n00:49:47,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n Hmm.\n\n00:49:49,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n Bruce, did you want to comment on any of the themes from your trilogy?\n\n00:49:54,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, I would just say it was super fun to reflect on 20 years at the same firm doing the same thing. And, you know, some of the lessons, lessons learned on it, you know, on the people front. One of the things that I come back to is the the power of luck in our business. No one wants to admit it, but it's a super important part of what we do. The stochastic nature of the science that we do, you know, getting um you know successful exits, you know, the overlap and Venn diagrams between you know talent um getting to a successful scientific result you know a new medicine and successful exit that's a pretty hard thing to get the triple bullseye on um much more often there's a piece of luck around any one of those and so leads you to the conclusion of staying humble but also that the celebrity worship that we have in our space and certainly in the tech space around certain founders, there's a lot of celebrity worship too. You know, I think it raises some questions.","char_start":45726,"char_end":50014,"start_time":"00:46:53","end_time":null}

You know, I think it raises some questions.\n\n00:50:54,980 [SPEAKER_0]\n Questions around that. And there are a lot of really exceptional leaders in our field who've rolled the dice a couple of times, and it takes six to eight years to report out on whether the science works. And when they don't work, it doesn't necessarily mean they're not exceptionally good. Leaders and CEOs. And we just have to be mindful of that particular point. That was one that I got a lot of personal feedback on as well. But over time, not overvaluing the celebrities and focusing on substance is super important.\n\n00:51:29,270 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I think that a few of the themes that stood out to me is one of them was around CEOs being good at resource allocation and managing.\n\n00:51:41,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n The burn, the timelines. And I think your point was that the board needs to really understand burn way the trade-offs and allocate costs accurately. I would also point out that, if if the CEO is doing their job. well, they're doing that very proactively. So once the board has to take um you know an active role in there, that's usually a sign that something's not right. And your other point, I think that was pretty interesting, was that. The signals that you likely need a CEO change are visible far before you make the decision.\n\n00:52:17,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n And you had mentioned a few of those signals. What are the ones that you think— really stand out in terms of red flags and on the CEO side?\n\n00:52:28,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, the— CEO point is, again, one you always know in the rearview mirror of, like, 'Darn, I should have done that earlier.' But you frequently convince yourself not to. You're in the midst of financing. Don't want to change. While we're financing, or you're in the midst of a BD discussion and you think it might scare the pharma company away. And so you sort of convince yourself to stick around. And sometimes that works, but most often, you know, both— if you're recognizing it, then the team probably recognizes it as well. That you know the CEO might not be excelling at what they're doing or maybe floundering. And, you know, frankly, a lot of times they're overstressed about they recognize they're underperforming. And so that just leads to even more challenges. I think that the signals around storytelling, fundraising, traction on the BD, I comment about the two different flavors of CEOs that some are openers and some are closers. Very rarely do you have somebody who's great at both of those two things. Um, it does happen on rare occasions, but more typically, you know, you need to put a CEO who's a closer next to a CEO who's not, and those kinds of team complementary team dynamics you start to think about a lot more.\n\n00:53:43,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n But you know, those are a lot of the signals that you see in boardrooms and you see in traction, like, 'Hey, how come the B round was really hard? The C round was hard, and now we're struggling to get a deal done That might actually be a real signal there.\n\n00:53:57,970 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I'm curious to hear from the analysts on here. To what extent do the analyst and investor community pick up on those signals earlier and wonder about that, versus kind of being surprised when there's a change in management?\n\n00:54:16,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, I'd say in my case, maybe it's mixed.\n\n00:54:21,700 [SPEAKER_2]\n And at times, you know, a lot of times it's obvious way ahead of time. I would say when you know it's going to happen, it usually happens fairly late.\n\n00:54:32,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, and the company would have been better served if we had done it much earlier.\n\n00:54:37,340 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um, the [the] which you know begs the question. I think we've talked about it many times. Do boards do most boards really have a good pulse as to what's going on and do they really have the right discussions or not?\n\n00:54:50,500 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, this whole concept of boards and how boards and management are thinking about shareholders. I think that in our field, the boards do a really good job thinking about the company, the culture.","char_start":49714,"char_end":54098,"start_time":"00:50:54","end_time":null}

That's really, that's always front and center. But sometimes.\n\n00:55:13,870 [SPEAKER_4]\n Don't necessarily have the shareholder hat on as much as they probably should.\n\n00:55:20,129 [SPEAKER_4]\n I liked your other point.\n\n00:55:21,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n I agree. I was going to say, I agree with that entirely. There are so many topics on a board. You can have a whole call on it. You know, boards don't want to rock the boat. You know, that's super common. A lot of the time, boards, especially as they become public, have more independence on them. They all are effectively serving at the discretion of the CEO. And so, everybody is super supportive and cheerleading, and you're supporting the team. And of course, you have tough conversations about certain things. But generally speaking, no one wants to rock the boat. Around, you know, being tough on compensation discussions, being tough on objectives, performance, digging into the details of cash burn, you know, how many CFOs have said, like, 'Wow, this is uncomfortable.' They're micromanaging me or they're down in the weeds of this particular discussion of resource allocation. Boards need to do that. I think you'd much rather err on the side of a board that knows too much about the inner workings of a business than too little.\n\n00:56:24,720 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thank you. But a lot of times you lose, especially as they become public, you lose large owner-director roles. And I think that's a huge problem in small cap public biotechs where there really aren't any large owners in a bunch of those companies' boardrooms. And, you know, that leads to a view of, you know, less of a discussion about things like dilution and appropriate resources. allocation and such. That's why I love seeing the big public investors, the bakers, the BVFs, the perceptives, the avoros, actually playing real roles in the boards of companies they have a lot of conviction around. I think it's a wonderful thing.\n\n00:57:06,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n I also think that. This concept of truth-seeking leadership is really important because if you take that approach from the beginning and you get the board, comfortable with the fact that you're going to share. uh everything the problems the you know the the different scenarios and all of that. You end up getting a lot more support and a lot less micromanaging if you're being proactive around those things. Totally.\n\n00:57:33,400 [SPEAKER_0]\n Particularly that truth-seeking is really important. I mean, it's always important in a company, but I find it super important, you know, in those early years. Through early clinical when you're getting data that doesn't look like what you thought it would look like. You know, you have one type of leader who is truth-seeking around the facts. What we thought. We have a gate around this. There's a no-go question. We're going to answer it. And if it's not right, we're either going to shut the program or shut the company down. And you move on because time from a really great executive is more scarce than capital, frankly.\n\n00:58:09,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n You often see what happens is the data comes, and then the hand waving starts, and the hand waving moves really, really fast, trying to explain, 'Oh, we kind of expected this to happen.' This is what we thought might happen. Except the board and you know the rest of the team— we never heard that that was what we thought would happen, of course, right? And so you get into all of this hand waving that sort of tries to explain away the morphing of the hypothesis that you're going after. You know, that's where truth-seeking really helps align everyone around. Let's face it, in science, especially in the translation of academic work, a lot of this isn't going to play through the way we hope it will.\n\n00:58:49,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, and I think that's why it's really important in advance to say what you think success will look like, sort of set a bar for success, set a bar for sort of this is not what we'd like to see, but it's great. And then agree in advance, like, this is bad. We wouldn't want to see this. And then you plan.","char_start":53798,"char_end":58288,"start_time":"00:54:50","end_time":null}

I thought they'd be on the up and up today. Seems to be a weekday in the tape, but let's hope things move in a positive direction as we finish out this year. I thought that we'd start with some high-level policy and regulatory news, certainly headlines around George Tidmarsh resigning and a lot of theatrics that seem to be in the background.\n\n00:01:03,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think Adam, do you want to comment on this and start off there?\n\n00:01:09,180 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, it was quite the start to the week, right?\n\n00:01:12,300 [SPEAKER_5]\n George Tidmarsh, head of CEDAR. I guess. Depending on which kind of side of the story, he was put on leave, he resigned, he decided to fight the resignation. But now he's gone. But yeah, this all. Know kind of give you a little backstory. This all has started happening. Actually, a week ago, right, when.\n\n00:01:31,640 [SPEAKER_5]\n When George Timush was called into Makari's office, as we reported on last Friday. George thought that he was actually. Going to get some good news during this meeting with Martin Mercari that. That Vinay Prasad was going to be fired from the FDA. Instead, he heard. He learned that. No, in fact, it was him. Who was getting the boot. And this all centered around, as we reported. Senator around a complaint that had been filed by. Kevin Tang. Healthcare investor, I think. Probably a lot of people on this call at least know or have heard of. Who had filed a complaint with the FDA.\n\n00:02:10,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n About the fact that just that George was using his position. Uh, as head of Cedar, to thank you. Essentially, the exact revenge. On Kevin because of some, you know, the falling out that the two of them had. Years ago.\n\n00:02:29,350 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think that it's created a lot of uncertainty in the markets, clearly. I mean, I think we had come to a place where, you know, uncertainty with FDA.\n\n00:02:40,480 [SPEAKER_2]\n Uh, it seems as if you know, com investors had become a bit more comfortable with the uncertainties, but certainly today's or Monday's news clearly kind of sets things in a completely different direction. I think we've had some other FDA-related news that has impacts on individual companies, and particularly with respect to Sarepta, we've got a couple of analysts. That covers Sarepta. And maybe I'll start off with Brian, if you want to comment there.\n\n00:03:11,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I'd love to kind of kind of bring that up. I think, actually, it would be sort of something we want to talk about a little further down, because just kind of going back to Adam's commentary on the Tidmarsh resignation.\n\n00:03:24,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think one of the things that I've heard a lot from investors. And what came really on top of this is not just his resignation, but the Unicure news. And, you know, I'll try to pass it over to Paul to kind of walk through a little bit of that.\n\n00:03:37,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n That I think came about both through the Tidmarsh news over the weekend and the Unicure decision.

Carry that we've had on sort of like the flexibility, like, oh, we're going to prove things for orphan diseases based on, you know, natural history data or, you know, based on preclinical evidence, stuff like that, sort of pushing. Sort of the classical GOP talking points, enormous flexibility around these things. And so I think Tidmarsh kind of losing out in what seems to be a little bit of a civil war with— than I. Um, then leading into the Unicure decision. And, you know, we'll have to discuss thoughts on that. But I think certainly there's a concern that, you know, is that Unicure flip? Tied somewhat to um, you know, maybe even I being more of the emerging vector in uh, in the civil war period. It's certainly something where I think those of us who know when I Adam and I know him from long ago. It's sort of the type of thing that he would really look at and scoff at.\n\n00:04:47,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I don't know. Maybe we should jump to Paul first to just kind of talk through the Unicure decision. Yeah. essence kind of ties in down this room.\n\n00:04:58,090 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, thanks, Brian. Can everyone hear me okay?\n\n00:05:00,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, we can.\n\n00:05:01,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n Okay great, thanks guys. Um, yeah, the Unicure thing is crazy. Because I mean, I think at face, you know, even if you're a believer that the efficacy of their Huntington's gene therapy looks promising at three years or really, really promising. I mean, it's still, I think, reasonable, no matter how bullish you are, that you can debate those data, right? It's not a big sample. We know the study didn't separate from placebo at one year. There's a valid explanation for that, but that's just the reality. So I think like. We all knew— I think people who own Unicure— that there's valid nitpicks with those data, even if they look really promising and the three-year data was kind of backed validating the two-year breakthrough therapy status. But I think the bigger issue here is that you know, it just makes the FDA seem super unpredictable in this space. And, you know, none of us were in the meeting, right? Like, as an analyst covering Unicare really closely, I haven't seen meeting minutes.\n\n00:06:02,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n So, you know, we've seen companies in the past, right, like misinterpret the FDA or think the FDA's vibe is super positive, but it's a little bit more neutral, right? We understand that there's a subjectivity to this, but I guess just being close to this unicorn situation.\n\n00:06:16,750 [SPEAKER_0]\n Like, I thought their regulatory alignment for something flexible like this was was maybe a lot more thorough and rigorous than average. Right, like they had had a meeting a year ago using this kind of natural history control for their analysis. Right, and you know that's one thing. You could just say the FDA is open to it, but then they had a separate meeting in the spring where they actually essentially like unified on an SAP, right? A statistical analysis plan for this three-year data, and incorporated some really specific feedback from the FDA, right? The FDA actually— you know, was kind of aligned with them using a different natural history database than the two-year data, a slightly different analytical methodology with how you compare the patients and their study to a natural history study. And alongside this meeting, Unicure got breakthrough, right? Which, you know, seems like the FDA is kind of saying, 'Hey, this two-year data. Looks promising. We're setting you up with an SAP.' That if you actually corroborate this again, you're set up well, right? So for them to have this three-year data, that was considerably better than expected, right?","char_start":3403,"char_end":7524,"start_time":"00:03:37","end_time":null}

And then to have this meeting where, essentially, they don't have the minutes of the outcome, but they're saying that the FDA kind of conveyed to them that this natural history analysis, actually, because it wasn't the goal of the study from the outset, is actually exploratory and not something that can support a BLA submission. surprising. And I think there's some investors who, again, have come out and said, 'Well, hey, this data has had issues.' We've known that. To me, that's not the point.\n\n00:07:54,520 [SPEAKER_0]\n It's like they had a meeting around SAP four months ago, like, 'Are we supposed to believe that that was like a sham meeting?' Right, like for lack of a better word, so like, I just think, like, for the investor community, if we just kind of take a step back, like, obviously, we'll see how the unicorn situation plays out. Like there was a Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that seems to be applying kind of the same pressure on the FDA that we had seen over the summer with Replimune and Stealth Biosciences. But then, separately, there's this kind of broader flow-through to the gene therapy space. Because, you know, there's a number of other companies in this space that are running single arm phase three studies. I think what a few of those companies have come out and said, and rightfully so, is that we've sort of pre-specified this from the beginning.\n\n00:08:36,940 [SPEAKER_0]\n But, you know, like as Scorny's talking about, right, like all these things are changing in real time.\n\n00:08:42,780 [SPEAKER_0]\n And if Prasad is just kind of won the recent power struggle and like, you know, I think there's investors kind of asking, OK, well, what are the implications for for everybody else? And I think the other sort of complicating thing here too is that we actually, in late September, just got FDA draft guidance for gene therapy and cell therapy that like sort of aligns with Unicure and many of these other companies are doing. And again, like late September feels like right now to me—emotionally, like a year ago— but it was five weeks ago. And so. I mean, I think all of this stuff is still really dynamic. It feels like the Tidmar situation to me.\n\n00:09:19,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n Even though it's potentially unrelated to what's happening at CBER, it opens the FDA up to maybe more political pressure just because of the broader optics around instability. But guessing what the next move is, is hard. And when Adam, I'm not saying this just because you're on the call, some investors have been asking me, what's the next catalyst for Unicare? And I'm like, well, let's see the stat news expose and what's happening at the FDA.\n\n00:09:41,560 [SPEAKER_5]\n Well, we're we're working we're trying we're trying to do that. Paul, I want a question for you that's a follow-up because I think you made a good point.\n\n00:09:49,140 [SPEAKER_5]\n There has been some debate about the data and the way it's been analyzed with the natural history. Do you feel like these kinds of issues, though, are review issues, meaning that, you know, maybe in a different time and place within the FDA, these are the kind of things that, you know, they would have filed. The filing would have been accepted. And these are the kind of things you would see— brought up at an adcom. These are the kind of things that you would want to deliberate over during the review process and not just tell a company, 'no, you can't file.'","char_start":7224,"char_end":11118,"start_time":"00:07:20","end_time":null}

And Adam, I follow closely what you guys write. I follow what you've been saying about this on Twitter. You were saying, 'Hey, none of us were in the meeting. We don't know if there's something else about this data.' That we like haven't seen or there's like a nuance with it that's an issue, like all of that is true, but again, at least as I understand it, like, They're going to have to do, if this ever gets filed, sensitivity analyses around different ways to analyze this, compare the analytical methodology and how you compare versus natural history.\n\n00:10:53,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n I understand it like this: enroll HD study that they use versus track HD. And there's one other natural history cohort that they could be like, they're all very, very similar. So, you know, to, to your point, Adam, like, if this actually kind of got rejected under greater scrutiny from the FDA.\n\n00:11:13,190 [SPEAKER_0]\n It feels like that would have happened during a review. I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't know what could have happened at this meeting with the data we've seen and my understanding of what the little basic high-level sensitivity analyses would be.\n\n00:11:37,810 [SPEAKER_3]\n Did you all lose Paul? Yeah, we lost Paul.\n\n00:11:40,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Maybe what we can do is, I know we were talking about kind of inconsistencies with FDA. And gene therapy has been a space that has had its ups. It's had its downs.\n\n00:11:57,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n I kind of feel that, you know. Well, there he is. Right. Hey, Paul, you're back. Oh, sorry. Did I cut out? Yeah, you cut out.\n\n00:12:05,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh, that's awful. Okay.\n\n00:12:08,180 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm sorry, guys. I was getting another phone call and I just ignored it. And I thought that that was good enough. This is like the platform. platform we're using. I mean, I guess what I was saying, and I'll just be very, very brief, and then everyone can kind of turn it up is like, you know, what Unicure said about this meeting, which again, what I was trying to say is like, just based on the level disclosures I've seen, and then also the high level sensitivity analyses that you would do with this data versus other natural history databases, it's hard for me to see what would have come out just at a high level kind of meeting where you're looking at the data. Like you know, again, not I'm like a super super detailed patient level, I don't know what would have come out at this meeting that would have like shut the door right, like it feels like this should be reviewed, to your point, Adam. And then I think the question is just, you know, Unicure has said Vinay Prasad was not in this meeting. So is he directing the clinical team, the stats team separately? Is this folks in the clinical team who had been ambivalent, but maybe couldn't convey that back when.\n\n00:13:09,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Back when others were at the Siever, who've since who've since left, like folks that were under Peter Marx, and so, just like a lot of uncertainty. Um, but I'm sorry for cutting out. I'll just stop.\n\n00:13:18,790 [SPEAKER_5]\n I would hope you know. I would hope to see. I mean, radical transparency here and something I wrote this week is: 'The FDA has talked about radical transparency.' I mean, we now get We now get CRL letters in almost real time. Um, But it can work both ways. Right. And so.\n\n00:13:36,730 [SPEAKER_5]\n You know, it seems like it'd be a good if Unicur feels like it's in the right here, and that this is just sort of this unilateral power grab by Benai, to you know, just sort of to put a stamp on this. Um. You know, it would be great to see all those meeting minutes from Unicur, right? All the past meetings, all the agreements. Everything that the FDA told them. Um, you know, that I feel like, you know. Put that out in the open so that we can all see it.\n\n00:14:03,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n Can I just jump in and just want to add, just on sort of that topic, I mean, I think as much as we can like say— You know, is it Vinay specifically?","char_start":10818,"char_end":15189,"start_time":"00:10:19","end_time":null}

I think it's going to be less explicit than that. I think that what you see in the FDA is review teams feel emboldened one way or another, based on sort of of the leadership mentality, right? And like Peter Marks, like really pushed for this flexibility. And I think the review teams felt that push from leadership for flexibility, right? You know, Wilson Bryant was before him. He was less flexible, but he kind of, you know, he was sort of.\n\n00:14:40,670 [SPEAKER_1]\n shown the door by Peter Marks in an effort to be more flexible. So I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't— Fanay very specifically stepping in and saying, 'Oh, hey.' This is why this is like. 'Not going to fly' and we're not going to review this. I think it's more right. He is the de facto leader of CBER. He has very, very clear views that we know that are well publicized on his YouTube. Uh, on his podcast, um, so you know, we basically know his take on natural history studies for slowly progressive diseases, um, and and you could pretty much pull slides up on that. And I think we'll talk about some other diseases that he's been vocally critical of in a couple of minutes here. But I just wonder if it's less that these are a bunch of applications that are really on the bubble, right? Like, I don't think anyone's looking at the Unicure data and saying, 'Oh my God. This is a Lazarus effect.' You're kind of looking at the data and you're hopeful that when you do a comparison to natural history, that you're showing a slowing in the progression of the disease. But I think the level of certainty is certainly not there. And that's a lot of these applications.\n\n00:15:41,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n So I think when you. Think of these bubble applications].\n\n00:15:44,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n I just wonder, is it just the tone from leadership in the FDA that's shifting things? One way or the other.\n\n00:15:51,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n Well, we, for whatever it's worth, we spoke with, I guess it's okay for me to say this was public. With Ultragenyx this week, we did a session with them, and they did mention that the bar—of an agreement they had with the previous CBER under Peter Marks for the filing in MPS 3A, you know, UX 111, it was gene therapy. Um, that discussion and that plan then shifted under this new FDA, and what they, again, believe that they will be able to do during the review process.\n\n00:16:25,560 [SPEAKER_4]\n In terms of manufacturing documentation and finish some experiments. Ultimately, the carpet was pulled below them and they got a CRL out of nowhere. And the FDA wanted all that kind of settled ahead of time. So that was a change unexpectedly.\n\n00:16:41,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is anyone else like a little confused, though? Like, it felt like the obvious backlash that came out when When Peter Marks left, and, you know, basically we had Vinay Prasad and Macri was that, you know, they did their listening tour. They did their podcast. Online and it felt like their commentary around rare disease was very Peter Marxian. Right and then you know they put out these guidelines at the end of September on cell and gene therapy and again five weeks ago that read pretty pretty bullish for the space. Like, Why are we seeing, at least my read on their kind of public commentary on this stuff is super flexible. I think we're all reading these recent actions as much more inflexible. Like, are we supposed to believe that the public commentary is a little bit more like? Politics.\n\n00:17:34,420 [SPEAKER_5]\n Like, how do we think this kind of all like, I mean, I think I think you hit, you hit the— you're exactly right. It's it's the dissonance, right? It's the dissonance between the commentary and the things that Marty McCarty is saying that even in some respect, that when I is saying when they get together and they do their little podcast. Or in speeches versus the actions that we're seeing, right? They just don't. They don't line up.","char_start":14889,"char_end":19189,"start_time":"00:14:03","end_time":null}

I think going back, honestly, a couple of decades and definitely I mean, we're going to talk about Sarepta, but the hierarchy was always signaling flexibility. We don't look at phase one versus phase two. I mean, you can get it approved on. I remember Janet Woodcock saying you can get approved on a small patient study if you have an effect size. And so there was always this disconnect between what the hierarchy was doing—rah-rah, we're flexible, like we're willing to work with you— and the divisions who wanted to go old school. And apply that rigor. And so I. you know, I kind of look at you know, because we all heard this from the hierarchy. But translating that into practice is what. has taken time. Some would say it never fully was realized, but we did see this slow creep with accelerated approval, rare disease, that pendulum can always swing back. But I'm not that surprised that hierarchy, because their job is almost promotion, right? Market the FDA as willing to be flexible for the sake of patients, not getting in the way of industry.\n\n00:19:05,950 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I'm not too surprised that there's this dissonance, because I've seen it too many times in the past.\n\n00:19:12,300 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't even know that there's that. I mean, I think that there is definitely some some elements of dissonance, but I think when you you listen to like the words, I think there's a certainly at least a rationalization that it's not just a political leaning in terms of the dynamics. And I think, right, you can just go onto PubMed and if you just type in 'Prasad parachute,' you'll pull up a bunch of publications that he has published. You know, where he has this view that if you have a parachute, a medical parachute, where your effect size is 100 percent, you don't need controlled trials. You don't need a lot of study. You don't need many patients because. It is so profound. That. Absolutely, you do a natural history study. Absolutely, you do a 10-patient approval for a parachute. But his whole career arc is showing how most medical interventions are not accurate. Actually, parachutes and that kind of, you know, so I'll maybe segue into Serapta and the history here. Because, to me, I think to some extent, and, you know, this was earlier in my career, but certainly not early, early in my career. A lot of us kind of mark the Sarepta decision.\n\n00:20:14,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n On Exondus 51, you know, going back 10 years ago as sort of the first ship. And it's the first time I remember the intervention of a Cedar director. To change what is the normal designated signatory authority's decision and Ellis Unger's decision to recommend a CRL. For a Teplerson and overturn it led to a bunch of controversy. Bob Califf reviewed it eventually, you know, supported Janet's decision to overturn it, although not necessarily really giving a lot of the scientific support to it. So you know, and, you know, Chris and I go way back from. Um, you know, basically the early days of Sir Apta and Teplerson going through the regulatory approval process. Now, what happened earlier this week is Disrupt announced earnings and the concert with the earnings, they announced the failure of a large phase three study. Um, to my knowledge, the largest, longest uh DMD study that has ever been done. Not for Teplerson, but the the the two other um Exxon skipping agents that they got subsequently approved by the FDA.","char_start":18889,"char_end":22702,"start_time":"00:18:00","end_time":null}

We could talk about the data. And Sarepta certainly tried to make the best argument why, even though the primary analysis failed, the trends were favorable. They made this argument around 'if you excluded COVID patients, it didn't work.' And I think I'd love to hear Adam and Chris's take on this, because I think we've both been, you know, all three of us have really been in the weeds on this historically. And I think at different points, really did believe that this drug— um or this PMO axon skipping method hypothesis— would lead to a benefit. Um You know, it's kind of like a wake-up moment for me. Like, I don't think it worked.\n\n00:22:04,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Chris will probably remember, I really pushed. Um, Sirepta to do a two-year study because I've always said: look, there's a slowly progressive disease. You might not never pick up a signal in a 50-patient one-year study. But in the study of this size, to not show an effect size—um, you know, really calls into question, what are we doing?\n\n00:22:23,790 [SPEAKER_5]\n I mean, I went full snark on Twitter or at Twitter during the call, the disruptive call, Brian, you probably saw it, where I said, 'Doug Ingram is very, very good at making excuses.'\n\n00:22:37,220 [SPEAKER_5]\n And, you know, speaking. You know, look, we all know we went from. the six-minute walk test was the most was the best endpoint. And then, without what that endpoint failed. So then we went to the North Star. The North Star is the best endpoint. And that failed. And then we went to the stair, the stair. End point. That they just use. And that failed. So I.\n\n00:22:59,100 [SPEAKER_5]\n I mean, I guess I just agree. These drugs just don't, they don't work. And all we're hearing is just. excuses for for why we should do something else. I i don't i just don't understand it.\n\n00:23:12,450 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think there's a debate amongst investors whether this new regime in FDA is actually good for the industry or not good for the industry. Obviously, the uncertainty, the kind of flip-flopping or the, you know, just unpredictability is not helpful.\n\n00:23:28,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n But I'm wondering what you all think about.\n\n00:23:32,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n This kind of new regime, in terms of like, yeah, you have to have good clinical data that will support.\n\n00:23:40,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n And for even in these rare diseases, where, yes, we want something out desperately for patients, we've seen that, you know, we've seen a bending of rules, so to speak, to get certain drugs across the finish line. And I'm curious, maybe, Paul, your thoughts, and maybe we'll hand it off to Jeroen on your thoughts on kind of, is this good for uh the biotech industry for companies and then for investors as we look to help them you know make good stock.\n\n00:24:07,720 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Craig, I have some thoughts on this too, but I'll let Paul and Jeroen weigh in as well.\n\n00:24:11,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n Okay, I'll be super quick because I know everyone wants to chime in. I mean, I think, like, it can't be good. right now, unless it's predictable, right? Like the unicumure situation, like I said, whatever you think of that data, the outcome of them just approaching a pre-bla meeting after four months earlier agreeing on an SAP, I mean, whatever you think of the data, like that was not predictable, and by the way, the market's telling you that that was not predictable, you know, and I think, when we look ahead at other companies in this space that have certain regulatory agreements that have embedded flexibility in them, even with this current FDA, there are still investors who would be interested in funding these programs and putting capital to work. Uh, to help bring these treatments to patients, I mean, obviously, to get to make money on stocks, for at the end game, is getting drugs approved for patients. These investors are having trouble because I think people don't know if what is being said— you know Chris, you said this happened before, but people don't know if what's being said publicly on a podcast is really like the truth.","char_start":22402,"char_end":26865,"start_time":"00:21:17","end_time":null}

They make 15 times as much dystrophin, right? You know, I'm sure Brian, you get the question from people on what is the bar on the functional data for dying to get approved.\n\n00:25:37,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n I mean, you don't know and I don't know, right? So I do think even if we can come to some sort of conclusion that maybe like being more rigorous on the data and the efficacy data could be better, right? Which is like a theoretical argument, but I'm open to it. What I hate right now is I cover a number of companies where investors are asking me, like, 'Hey, the company has met with the FDA and the FDA said X or Y.\n\n00:26:02,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n Like, they don't even think the company's wrong, but they're worried like is that alignment real?' And I just think that in itself is not good for the industry.\n\n00:26:14,080 [SPEAKER_3]\n Let me comment on just all the whole FDA thing. First of all, I have mud on my face. I thought Tidmarsh was one of the better picks because of his biotech experience. And man, what a rookie mistake he made. Because it really hurt, I think, the credibility of the agency. By bringing a personal vendetta out in the forefront where people have criticized, is this how FDA responds? Do they like certain companies and not like other companies? Do they like certain CEOs? And, you know, the idea of having a standard where that should not come into play, it kind of is evidence, wow, maybe this does come into play more than people realize. Was some serious damage done. The hierarchy in fighting and just the uncertainty and the chaos that seems to ensue. Again, I don't think this is new. And going back to Brian, I think you mentioned it. And what's interesting, Califf did, Califf supported a committee that was led by Lou Borio that was called the Scientific Dispute Resolution Board.\n\n00:27:15,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n That Scientific Dispute Resolution Board voted in favor of overriding Ella Sanger's position against approval. Califf supported the scientific dispute resolution. Board to favor Janet's decision. So this idea that hierarchy gets involved, they have a dispute resolution process. was followed, you know, all the debate around, I think they followed the right protocol to ultimately approve a Teplerson. Now, I think you said it with the parachute comment. Brian, Avexis stands, I believe, as the gold standard, right? You've got 12, you know, type 1 SMA patients that were still living after two years. was disputing. That's a clear signal, should get approval, should get full approval. We should always have room for that. And I was always on the record of saying, DMD is not that, right? You're not going to see that type of effect, even with a gene therapy. And so just looking at essence, and by the way, Brian, I felt a year was enough.\n\n00:28:17,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I was against the two-year because it just meant we would take longer to get data. And I honestly, I'm appalled that it's taken this long because they renegotiated the trial design. They didn't start it until much later. I was getting pressure as CEO to start that study. Sooner rather than later, and was actually the one who got the first master protocol approved, which became essence. But then they renegotiated that, redesigned it, and it was delayed. So we shouldn't have to take this long. To get a readout when that study was approved and designed originally back in 2014.","char_start":26565,"char_end":30472,"start_time":"00:25:15","end_time":null}

That the drug would show in effect. I think it hasn't. I'm more concerned with what they haven't shown. Adam, you said it. It was a six-minute walk. North Star now forced their climb. What else did they capture, and what did that show? If the forced air— Klein is the best data that they were able to muster over two years. And I don't know, maybe they've shared more, or maybe they will share it at a future conference. You know, I would want to see the full dataset to make any decision. The only difference here, between the way I see it for gene therapy versus oligo RNA chronic administered drugs, is that, one, you've got safety that is more clear than the gene therapy safety. Data sets that are coming out. So that's number one, the risk-benefit is definitely different. And then number two, there was always this talk of if you approve drugs that are not rate—perhaps, you know, quell other drugs from getting to market.\n\n00:29:55,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n We have not seen that. So over the 10 years, we've only seen more and more and more. technologies being moved into the clinic for development because the FDA used a pretty low standard to approve those drugs. But on gene therapy, I think the issue still stands because you may have to factor out patients who will not be able to get a better gene therapy down the road without taking significant risk with immunogenicity, et cetera. So I think these are complicated. And the other thing is this raises the question of: is accelerated approval even good for the industry? Does it work when you've got over 10 years, thousands of patients that have been on these drugs? I am sure there are parents, and Adam, you guys have showcased DMD out of the gene therapy of, hey, they're benefiting. They're seeing benefits. You know, what is the FDA's position to go and say we're going to pull those drugs from the market and maybe what's driving the bullishness? From Doug and Sarepta saying, hey, I don't think there's any way these drugs are going to get pulled, and I'm not saying that's necessarily good for the industry, but when you look at the risk-benefit, you can understand where they may allow something.\n\n00:31:03,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n And then it comes back to the reimbursement. Are the insurers having more of a position to say, 'We're not going to reimburse because the evidence isn't there?' And then these poor families are going to have to pay out of pocket. So it's very complex. We do three shows on this as we've joked about, but I just wanted to highlight those themes.\n\n00:31:21,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then, Brian, you had Biohaven, which got a CRL. You want to talk about that?\n\n00:31:25,690 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so I think this is also super interesting in the context of everything that we are talking about as well as unicure right. Because in many ways, there's a lot of similarities here. So Biohaven received a CRL this week for their drug tririlazole, which was under review. Not by Cedar, but by Cedar. So Tidmarsh, you know, last weekend it was Tidmarsh's center. As of today, we have no center director, which is also interesting because, I mean. People are reporting that Pazder has turned it down. Um, as has the ond director, um. So we'll see who wants to actually take that spot, um. But Biohaven CRL was from Cedar, and you know the the story here was they they ran a um a phase three study that was a short follow-up and and it failed on the primary analysis it had a very very high p value above 0. 9 on the primary analysis, but they found a subgroup that they thought—there— there was some effect size in—um— you know, eventually—uh— they're trying to get approval for that—um— but said they wound up having a discussion with the FDA to discuss using the open label extension data that they've had","char_start":30172,"char_end":34348,"start_time":"00:28:52","end_time":null}

They've gone through a lot of meetings with the FDA and Biohaven's press release kind of goes through the history of meeting with the FDA to discuss a statistical analysis plan. And the way to look at the data sets for this natural history to then file for a natural, you know, a comparison between this three-year open label data and natural history.\n\n00:32:55,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n Statistical analysis that they did— you know— hit on primary endpoint. It hit on all secondary endpoints. Um, and you know, it was really kind of marketed as, 'Hey, you know, for a now history statistically significant data set.' This may be the gold standard, and they filed for approval. There's a lot of skepticism, you know. I think a lot of us kind of look at these natural history data sets, and a lot of the comments that you know, FDA reviewers and and the biostatistics groups within various centers have talked about— just the problems with natural history and the biases that can be introduced. And it goes back to what I was talking about with Van Nuys. Publications on what parachutes are in medical intervention.\n\n00:33:38,850 [SPEAKER_1]\n They got a CRF, so. You know, it wasn't a total surprise because of this natural history basis. You know, I think it was a little bit of a surprise in the context that, you know, the Biohaven management team kind of positioned this as a discussion. Over a long time with the FDA going through rigorous kind of statistical analysis plans for looking at this comparison. And the CRL was issued. They made an effort within their press release to kind of criticize the FDA and the history and say, 'Hey, this was a big surprise to us.'\n\n00:34:10,929 [SPEAKER_1]\n Know, we really feel like that are not given the proper due course in the review. And the CRL is up and, you know, looking at the CRL, I think it came up yesterday. It's unsurprising. They bring up the you know, the FDA just brings up, hey, you know, when you make these selections for studies, there's a lot of biases on a natural history cohort that, you know, you're not accounting for. And, you know, they kind of. They don't have a full review out. It's just a CRL, but they do have a couple of paragraphs and sort of a statistical analysis and tipping point analyses to say when you do certain tipping point analyses around. the assumptions they they wind up failing um statistically and and that seems the derivation for for that crl so here's kind of an example where you know we don't we we're a little blind on what the unicure discussion is um we're less blind on what the biohaven back and forth was because now we have the crl and we can see actually you know this This was a review where the statistics of it were really hammered in the CRL to say, you know, they just can't look at this three year open label natural history comparison data set and have real confidence that the effect size is real.\n\n00:35:19,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's and that's the driver. of the CR.\n\n00:35:23,280 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, the stock got hammered.\n\n00:35:25,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n And speaking of stocks that have been reeling—uh, you, you cover, uh, stoke therapeutics, which sold off on the heels of the unicure news.\n\n00:35:37,650 [SPEAKER_2]\n Would love for you to spend a minute or two just on that situation as they try to get a drug approved for Gervais.","char_start":34048,"char_end":37767,"start_time":"00:32:32","end_time":null}

All these events and And maybe just to zoom out and. Piggyback on what you said, is this positive or negative? The one concern is recall— what was only about three months ago that FDA came out with a new draft guidance on behalf of CDER and CBER. about using natural history, using preclinical modeling, predictive analyses, and areas where you can have targeted therapy or genetic medicine. Based on biomarkers, and then using real-world data, and all of that can support an approval for orphan indications without controlled studies. Since then, it's been a little bit of a train wreck. So, you know, this kind of seesaw situation, obviously, is sort of not a positive for the industry.\n\n00:36:35,990 [SPEAKER_4]\n The Stoke. So Stoke has a drug, just call it Zorivinarsan. It's an ASO for NAV11, which causes Dravet disorder. The phase one, two data. The NAV11 channel is both excitatory and inhibitory on neurons, and that's a channel that is completely affected unquestionably. In Dravet's order, and it's knocked down. What they're doing is essentially knocking up expression. And in the phase 1-2 data, the data overall looked really, really good. They have four years of data now showing a profound seizure reduction in patients who had six previous drugs, and there's neurocognitive benefits as well. It really looks like a disease-modifying therapy. But there are some questions and the questions were. Because they are back up regulating NAV11 in preclinical models. There was actually some untoward effect in dogs, admittedly in very high doses. Because of that, FDA kept it. Dosing. They subsequently, in the US, had a slightly different trial design than in the UK.\n\n00:37:39,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n They actually had a partial clinical hold in the US also because of an NHP. Which was never seen in patients. And the data overall looked really, really good, but it's not perfect because it's against natural history. The seizure reduction of your dog. 60 80 is unquestionable, so they're in the meantime are now enrolling really quickly. Biogen is their partner, and it's a phase three trial. It's going to be global, looking at one year. I'm sorry, a 24-week seizure reduction as a primary and then secondary endpoints, which are important for neurocognition, to really get a disease-modifying label. In the meantime, because they've broken under a new CEO, who maybe is a little bit more kind of savvy or willing to maybe engage more with the agency under a breakthrough designation, maybe than previous management to see if they could. File base on phase one, two. That's the biggest bottom line. And that's why the stock essentially doubled as of two weeks ago, and then the Unicure decision happened. So now we know, Kustok reported, they'll meet with FDA in December.\n\n00:38:43,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n There are some challenges, though. We've talked to other companies who are developing ASOs for DEEs, and they're saying filing based on phase one or phase two data is very complicated. Um, and we shall see. It's a little unquestionably the drug works, but there are some questions about. If you really want to get a broad label with neurocognition, you're going to be looking against natural history.\n\n00:39:06,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n The dosing in the US study versus the European, the UK study was different. And that's actually even different than what they were doing in the phase three. So which dose do you even suggest to put on the label? There's some structural issues as to what's going to happen with this.","char_start":37467,"char_end":41415,"start_time":"00:35:37","end_time":null}

There's some structural issues as to what's going to happen with this.\n\n00:39:20,250 [SPEAKER_5]\n Hey, Jeroen, question just as a follow-up. Do you think the stock really started moving up? Um, you know, over the summer. Right. When when Ian Smith, their new CEO, started kind of talking about this possibility of the early filing. Because, you know, one of the baretheses is. You know, one of the criticisms was that Space Street is going to take a long time, right? So, like, why be in the stock? It's going to take a long time. So this was. Know a faster, potentially faster way to get to approval? And the company started talking about that, and that really resonated with investors. Um, do you think that, that was like? I think people just read too much into that. I mean, you know, obviously, it was always going to be sort of a high-risk, uh, thing. Right? I mean, it's like, like, you mentioned, it was going to be— it's always difficult to to file on on early data like that. People didn't do. You think that people just got too ahead of themselves on that?\n\n00:40:12,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I mean, as you know, Adam, and then it gets into a situation where they have a certain amount of cash, and this is going to be a sizable product, right? And all our consultant checks are unbelievably encouraging. With the status set. They think this is the best-looking product in development, probably ever, for Druvet. But we're not going to have data to your point until second half 27. So it's a question of what's the chance that they can potentially be on the market a year or two earlier, essentially, let's say, the second half next year, as opposed to second half 28.\n\n00:40:41,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um. In a drug that's going to be at $500,000 per year, it's going to be a sizable product. And that's got its own inherent value. So even when the stock was at 38, you know, a week or two ago, people were thinking, 'Okay, it's a one and a half billion market cap, $ 400 in cash.' And if it's going to sell two billion peak, you can kind of figure out where you think the stock is going to go. And it's not a bad risk-reward. Um, and the stock was setting up for an update on the earnings call. People thought, and we all thought, the update's going to be whether they met with FDA already or not. And I think there was some hope that they've already met with FDA and had the green light.\n\n00:41:17,310 [SPEAKER_4]\n Look, there's also a question of what FDA says, and we all know, and then what the company communicates. And there's probably three scenarios. One, thumbs up, go ahead and file. We're very encouraged by the data and very supportive, aka you're getting approved. Two is. You can file if you really want to. We'll see if we even accept it. And you didn't meet any of your endpoints and things like that. That's probably not going to go well. And then there's always that gray zone. It's going to be a review question or review decision. And what exactly that means for Wall Street, that's completely opaque. Because it could be a review decision and they're just kind of— you know— saying it to keep their options open, but they're going to approve it and they're actually very supportive versus. Yeah, go ahead and file it. It's a review decision. And just say, FYI, you're not getting approved.\n\n00:42:04,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n We don't know which one it is, and that's usually the challenge. And the question is, does the company?\n\n00:42:09,950 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. These are all facts. Go ahead. I was going to say, I think like one of the ironies about the Stokes situation, and I don't know if there's any, you know, I'm not saying there's tea leaves to read about it, but just to bring things full circle is the outcome. CEO who left before sort of the concept of filing on this data was actually the CEO who was at Sarepta when a Teplerson got approved.\n\n00:42:32,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yep.\n\n00:42:33,979 [SPEAKER_1]\n A lot of us know.\n\n00:42:35,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n Small world. Yep. In other industry news, we've got a bidding war going on for Metzera, which is a saga in its own right.

And just a final comment on this whole FDA thing. I honestly I think it was maybe necessary when the old guard left the FDA. But I long for, I mean, many of us long for the days when you had Janet Woodcock. The Bob Temple, the steady decades, you've got a whole new regime. Who has not worked together and, And I think there was even battles and infighting with the old guard. But I think, and Adam, you had a good kind of sober-minded view, like let's not blame everything on the FDA. Sometimes you got to look at the data. And I'll just add that industry really looks at these decisions. Less so than guidance, right? What is the FDA calling on all of these? And that's guiding all of us. So moving to MedSara, I mean, this is overall, as an investor, now, this is a good thing. You know, we've been five years in, you know, what was ultimately a buy-siders market for investment. Meaning that the investors would dictate the terms for a startup.\n\n00:43:58,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n And this is a clear signal that if you have a good drug and you are in demand and there's scarcity value for a battle, that this is what you ultimately want to see as a biotech. Investor is that pharma is tripping over themselves to get good assets right or to not lose out, and so this— when we see these types of bidding wars— I think it's good. I mean, at the end of the day, the market caps and the currency value that Pfizer and Novo have, I mean, these become rounding errors, and the beneficiary is— the Medcera shareholders and team. And it's just nice to see even this kind of mudslinging, right, of Novo calling Pfizer.\n\n00:44:44,520 [SPEAKER_3]\n BS on their call that it's antitrust. So anyway, it's fun to watch. But I think overall, this is good. When pharma is stepping in, they realize that biotech has important assets, and it's nice to see when there's a bidding war that ensues.\n\n00:45:06,930 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thank you.\n\n00:45:08,370 [SPEAKER_2]\n Other weather. We were working on a few more things.\n\n00:45:12,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Huge billions of dollars of revenues that are potentially going away and big balance sheets by pharma.\n\n00:45:23,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n I missed a little bit of that, Craig. I don't know who was, but basically. I think the patent clips are real. I think this is why we've seen some robust M&A. I think it will continue for assets that have clear clinical proof of concept. Everybody believes is headed to approval. Obviously, Avidity is a good example of that recently. And so, you know, this is all a good thing. And along with the XBI, along with the follow-ons along with IPO window. I know billion to one is not necessarily drug biotech, but I think there's really good signs that momentum is—probably gonna be sustained.\n\n00:45:58,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n We do have some other company-specific news, but before we go there, Adam, you wrote a really fascinating article on Arena Bioworks. Could you share, with us, kind of, with that shutdown, kind of, what you reported on?\n\n00:46:13,440 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, that was my colleagues, Jason Mast and Allison DeAngelis.

Allison actually had gotten a tip. Uh, a week or so ago, maybe even longer, just that Arena.\n\n00:46:24,880 [SPEAKER_5]\n Bioworks was was having some difficulties. And for those who aren't familiar, it's kind of This was a very buzzy sort of, I don't know, maybe Chris, you can kind of maybe describe it a little bit better than I can, but kind of a hybrid between like a, it's like a research institute. that they had raised like $500 million or had $500 million in committed capital. to this new venture, which was going to kind of be a bridge between academia and industry and you were going to get all of these. Very, you know. A-list type scientists to come in and tackle. big big big scientific challenges and then spinoff companies, and then the company. uh by arena you know, very suddenly and surprisingly shut down]. This week, there was an all-hands meeting where they shut down essentially over, you know, basically over financing and then the inability to, you know, because of the difficult financing market these days, particularly for private companies, they didn't see a way forward and are shutting down.\n\n00:47:24,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'll just add to that briefly. So first, shout out to Allison DeAngelis because she was first on the trail. When Arena was being formed, I remember getting calls and I didn't know, but it was basically taking like the the best science out of the Broad and the Whitehead Institute and the Koch Institute, but privatizing that. Turning it into an investment profitable model, which many of us felt that was a dubious goal, because drug discovery is not easy. To drive money. And if you're gonna pay people top dollar to do bench work and lab research, you might come up with some potential investment ideas, but 50 million a year over 10 years was the idea to turn out all of these new biotechs.\n\n00:48:09,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n Many of us are like, 'Wow, how are you going to really create value when you're basically just coming up with a new drug with maybe a novel target?' And the other thing is, I think they're dealing with the headwind of this year alone, when you look at seed and Series A investments, it's been essentially at a 10-year low. So most of the money has been going into de-risk later-stage clinical data-driven biotech Series Bs, Cs, and Ds. And I think they were probably feeling the effects of that, but it's already a hard model even in a healthy market, unless everything's going IPO. So not too surprised, but I think the investors were probably saying, 'How are we going to get our money back and make a return after two years and a hundred million dollar investment?' Uh, maybe the writing was on the wall there.\n\n00:48:55,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n What's the pulse from what you guys are all hearing from private companies? Have things maybe gotten a little bit better, or are they still really, really challenging?\n\n00:49:06,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'll just jump in from the venture side. It's a trickle down, so. Venture is always a lagging indicator. So when the public markets downturn, we kind of like say, well, let's wait and see, maybe it'll rebound. And when the markets start to turn up, it's also a wait and see, like, is it real? Like, can we expect more IPOs? Are the valuations going to be, you know, higher and sustained? And so I think right now is probably the most optimistic that venture has been. And we're starting to see more check writing. But I'd say we're not all in at this point. We're kind of waiting and seeing. But I think another quarter or two of some IPOs, you know, valuations, you know, keeping steady, obviously XBI over 100 and seeing some growth there. All of those signs are going to really, I think, bode well for venture private companies receiving money in 2026.\n\n00:49:59,180 [SPEAKER_2]\n And my guess, Chris, is that it's, as you might have mentioned before, more of the de-risked later stage companies, maybe further in the clinic, maybe close to, you know, phase two, phase three. versus some of the earlier stage stories, unless you're a unicorn of some sort.

Is that fair as an assessment?\n\n00:50:17,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, yeah, I mean, if you look at the IPO queue, there's several flagship companies and those were, you know, the bubble. IPOs for a while there, so I think we're going to be watching that closely. I think, if, if the IPO comes back to supporting an early stage program that maybe is de-risked with some you know, in vivo PK that shows differentiation or something like that, then you could see more money flowing. I think you see a chasing and a following and crowding around. certain targets. So best in class, I think has a better chance of getting early money than a new unvalidated novel target, you know, that is, that is in preclinical testing. I think that will take a while for the checks to really start flowing to those types of companies.\n\n00:50:59,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n Let's switch to some of these more company-specific items. And Brian, you cover Soleno Therapeutics, which was a hot stock and certainly one that people were watching.\n\n00:51:11,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n I guess they reported and comments on Salino.\n\n00:51:15,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. So, you know, I could say I wasn't only blown up on regulatory stocks this week, also commercial. So Salino announced their quarter. And yes, this was this is a. A drug that was approved back in March, um, you know, not controversial, but a debated approval decision is because they, you know, originally did an RCT that failed, uh and you know, they had a similar explanation, like Serapta, that you know, COVID had a role in that failure, um but they didn't. They didn't really file for approval based on the RCT. What they did is they did a randomized withdrawal study. And the randomized withdrawal study looked very positive. Now, there's obviously debates about how much confidence one can have in a randomized withdrawal study. There's more potential bias at play there than in a treatment initiation RCT. But the data looked really good. The FDA approved it. I don't think it was a really controversial decision. And it's on the market for Prader-Willi, which is, you know, horrific disease if anyone has familiarity with it.\n\n00:52:19,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n The patients are really in need, like 24/ 7 care for sort of this you know really compulsive desire to eat. And the drug treats this primary symptom, which is this compulsive desire called hyperphagia. And this was the second quarter of sales.\n\n00:52:37,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n It uh you know it doubled the first quarter of sales, it beat consensus, we were street high at 58 million, they came in at 66 million. So you know, I think if if you look back and March or April, and thought they were going to do 66 million in the second quarter. You would think this was a home run of a stock if you just kind of looked at the headline without knowing much about it and knowing, sort of, where consensus was— um versus where the sales came in. You'd think the stock would be up a substantial amount and, you know, the stock has—uh—gone down, you know, more than 30 percent—um— on the report. And there's a lot of reasons for this. So over the summer, the Scorpion Capital issued a short report on this company, basically claiming that you were seeing— adverse events stack up, in particular, hyperglycemia and peripheral edema and pulmonary edema, leading to hospitalizations that, you know, the patients were not wanting to go on the drug or they were stopped from taking the drug. Physicians are being more and more hesitant to put patients on the drug.\n\n00:53:39,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n And this is really sort of clouded— a lot of the salino story, um, and you know, interestingly, like talking to investors.","char_start":52511,"char_end":56448,"start_time":"00:50:17","end_time":null}

And a lot of the data. even in the quarter, kind of indicates that that isn't the case. They did 397 new start forms, which is certainly down from like the initial bolus, but I still think, you know, weekly rate of about 30 is. decent number the eight the discontinuation rates look you know sort of what one would expect for a drug and disease of this profile. So you know it's not really showing that things are falling off of a cliff, but you know certainly people are are now concerned that you know is this a a drug that has a couple of good quarters and then kind of runs into a plateau. And, you know, when I try to have tried to pitch it in in in the fall off in the stock price this week, you know, a lot of people come back and they say, you know, look at like a Skyclarus or look at a debut, which had. You know two, three great quarters and then just kind of ran into a wall and like this, you know, call it 80 to 100 million dollar range. And those drugs have kind of just been clicking away, getting, you know, maybe a little patient growth, but but nothing, you know, like what investors have been looking for.\n\n00:54:56,500 [SPEAKER_1]\n So that's sort of where the controversy on Salino falls right now. Are a little worried that it's going to take time to really show that the plateau isn't going to occur in another quarter or two.\n\n00:55:11,090 [SPEAKER_1]\n With sort of the short report criticism, that sort of hammered on the ability for people to kind of take more risk on the name. But, you know, Adam had a commentary on Twitter listening to the call. And, you know, part of the feedback is Salinas, sort of, a management team that I would argue is very opposite in terms of like Sarepta, you know, and I actually like their management style. They're very non-promotional. You know, they kind of talk down their dialogue with FDA throughout the whole review process. They were never like, 'Oh, yeah, look, we are, you know, we're personal friends with this reviewer.' And, you know, the data is just so crystal clear. And, you know, there's there's no problem. They just kind of categorized and said, 'You know, here's the data. Here are the issues with it. Here are what we think.' Um, you know, to me, they've sort of been a.\n\n00:55:58,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n A great example of under-promising and over-delivering on things. You know, pushback now is kind of in this commercial launch cycle of, you know, investors are kind of calling for more energy and more enthusiasm. And one of the things I think really turned people off is they they sort of cited the short report in the call. And, you know, I think a lot of us will say. Management 101 recommendation would be. Do not publicly call out the shorts. You can criticize them. You could leave the sell side to kind of try to counter detail. But when you when you give them sort of the air, you know, it takes on a whole connotation and people worry. Um, you know, are you worried and that's why you're doing right? I think you know.\n\n00:56:40,540 [SPEAKER_2]\n I've had experience with Scorpion Capital in my own coverage universe. Uh, cover a company called Harmony Biosciences, which is in the narcolepsy.\n\n00:56:49,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n We have had some— narcolepsy marketplace updates, and Paul Santessa had some orexin data. You want to comment on that?\n\n00:57:00,930 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, very briefly.

Um, you know, this erection space has continued to be super hot and interesting.\n\n00:57:07,230 [SPEAKER_0]\n We think these could be a big class of drugs across an array of sleep disorders. You know, we've seen data from Takeda and narcolepsy type 1, Alkermes from narcolepsy type 1. There's been some historical mixed data in narcolepsy type 2. So going into the Sintesa readout, I think there were really like two questions. One is just: is their drug going to be differentiated? uh, and two are: we gonna see efficacy outside of narcolepsy type one, because the biological rationale in type one is uniquely great, and then type two and other indications like idiopathic hyper insomnia, it's less clear-cut. The Sintesa data are positive in that the drug clearly works. In narcolepsy type 1, there's a big effect size. There's an effect that's clearly clinically significant. Narcolepsy type two, you know, maybe the data didn't meet the bull case for Sintesa because I think, at face it looks more similar to some of the other products. And, you know, in the sleep disorder space, we've seen data sets that are in kind of these smaller phase one type studies, which regress a little bit to the mean in phase two and phase three. And so. You know, maybe the story there is not over as it relates to Syntesa because they will be kind of tweaking their dosing and potentially going higher.\n\n00:58:09,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n But as I kind of think about it, I mean, this is sort of validating for the whole class in that. Can have success in narcolepsy type 2 when you push the exposures higher than type 1, because it's a less sensitive population. And the next kind of data set here is we're going to get a bigger, longer phase two narcolepsy type two data set from Alkermes. And I think that's Thank you. That's going to be a big catalyst for, I think, how investors even just kind of view this Contessa data, right? Because their type two data set was small and a shorter duration and also the size of the class. Because if the Alkermes type two data is clear cut, you can start to dream the dream around other sleep disorders that are more heterogeneous. So it continues to be an exciting space.\n\n00:58:52,170 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yes, Harmony does have also their own orexin. It's preclinical. They're going to put it into the clinic. But yes, this orexin is really fascinating and one that we'll be watching. You know, maybe the last thing that I'll wrap up with is I wanted to make a comment on turns pharmaceuticals. Especially as we head into the Ash cancer meeting in December down in Orlando. Turns has an allosteric site. It acts as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for CML. Lots of debates amongst investors with another company called Enliven Pharmaceuticals, which are therapeutics that have a very intriguing compound that's a little further ahead than turns. Turns had some ash abstract data where six-month MMR data of 64 percent uh basically like blew the doors out when looking at benchmarks that are for the current other competitor allosteric drug, which had a 25% six-month MMR. We had benchmarks of 32% for a six-month MMR for the enlivened compound.\n\n00:59:57,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n And so for turns to show, 64% was really.\n\n01:00:02,010 [SPEAKER_2]\n you know, a home run. The stock has more than doubled since the beginning of the week. So with that said, it is a small data set. They're going to have an update in ash. Thank you. I'll be down there. Down in. Orlando later, or in early December, but certainly a lot of fireworks happening and lots of therapeutic areas.","char_start":59797,"char_end":63587,"start_time":"00:56:49","end_time":null}

I'm John Maragonori, and my co-host today, really great group of people, are Yaron Weber, Amy Fadia. And special guests, Allison DeAngelis and Drew Armstrong. Don't you like it that your guys are special, Drew and Allison? That's nice.\n\n00:00:28,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers or to listen to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout.com. Now, Amy, I think I'm supposed to hand it over to you because you also had some disclaimer language to add to all this.\n\n00:00:43,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n Oh, thanks for having me here today. I just wanted to mention that any comments that I make about the companies that I cover are not meant to be taken as any type of investment advice. That's all I had. Thank you.\n\n00:00:58,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, great. And Yaron, do you have anything to add like that that you need to? I do not, but that holds true as well. Thank you.\n\n00:01:06,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Great. Okay. Fantastic. Well, we're going to start with some policy topics that emerged during the week.\n\n00:01:16,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n Last, you know, nine, 10, 11 months, it's been every week has got some new piece of news on the policy or FDA side. And this is no exception to that. Whatever. I think the big news was Rick Pazder getting selected to and agreeing to become the the director of CDER, Center for Drug and Evaluation, which of course regulates the vast majority of products that come out of our industry. So a super critical role by all accounts. Obviously, earlier this month, we saw the departure of George Tidmarsh as the as a Cedar director. And, and that appeared to be related in part to some of some of his actions.\n\n00:02:06,360 [SPEAKER_1]\n Uh, related to Kevin Tang and a lawsuit that had been filed. Um, maybe there were other reasons, but we don't we don't really know. But I think you know, the Tid Hard Departure, you know, sort of opened up the bandage and the wound around industry concerns around stability. At the FDA, which is obviously an area of enormous focus for our industry. We all need a strong and stable and consistent FDA for us to be able to be successful in bringing innovation to patients. So the good news this week, earlier this week, was that Rick Pazder agreed to step in as the new Cedar director. You know, I'm sure everybody on the call has heard. About Rick before. He's really a legend at the FDA. He's been there for over 25 years. And most importantly, he is the guy as it relates to oncology. And a lot of the FDA decisions over the last quarter of a century that have come out of the oncology side really, um, owe a lot of a lot of thanks back to Rick at the end of the day.\n\n00:03:18,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, you know, the guy is very well respected, he's a clinician and obviously a very well-known regulatory science professional. So it really is a breadth, breath of fresh air for industry, who I think all of us are eager to see more stability and consistency at the FDA.\n\n00:03:41,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hope it goes well. You know, there's been some historical evidence that the CBER chief, Vinay Prasad, has publicly disagreed with Pazder. But there was a very chummy photo that was posted on X just the other day, just yesterday, I believe, with Marty Macri and Prasad and Rick Pazder.\n\n00:04:01,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n We all hope it's a sign of rapprochement that these three leaders will work closely together in a collaborative and positive manner. To help regulate the science of our industry. Let me see if Yaron or Amy or Drew or Allison, anybody wants to add something to that, but I certainly thought it was good news.\n\n00:04:24,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, maybe I'll chime in, John. So it's definitively good news. You know, PASDR is one that we all wanted as a stabilizing force.","char_start":0,"char_end":3952,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

So it's definitively good news. You know, PASDR is one that we all wanted as a stabilizing force.\n\n00:04:34,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, we can all hope for two things. One, that he's going to have sort of the old school, but progressive, progressive, I mean, from a regulatory perspective, progressive, innovative kind of approach. Which will kind of maybe moderate some of the changes and provide sort of an even tone. At the same time, we just want to make sure that ODAC doesn't suffer any setbacks at all. And yet, you know, it will be it will be devastating if a year from now, Pastor raises his hands and says, 'It's time for me to move on.' Which I doubt.\n\n00:05:05,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that would be a big loss, not only for Cedar now, but also for ODAC for sure.\n\n00:05:13,880 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, let's go on to some other FDA news. And I think the other big news from the FDA this week was a New England Journal of Medicine article that was authored by Marty Macri and Vinay Prasad on the so-called plausible mechanism pathway. I mean, this has been hinted to by Commissioner Macri on a few occasions over the last, you know, eight months or so. You know, part of it was inspired by the remarkable story of baby KJ, who is the N of one baby who received a CRISPR therapy for your recycle disorder.\n\n00:05:55,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n Really remarkable story. And Jeroen, I think you wanted to talk a little bit about this pathway first, and then maybe all of us can chime in a little bit about what it means. So why don't you take it away?\n\n00:06:06,810 [SPEAKER_2]\n yeah perfect so so number one so this came out in new york journal of medicine literally this week it's a very short two-pager so i commend them on brevity um it's ambitious um it's a little vague which is okay at this stage and it's that's more kind of an intention than maybe exact policy Before we dive into it, because there's some interesting things in there, the one thing that's interesting, It is stipulated to go into a bespoke, personalized therapies that are gene therapy and cell therapy— sort of, you know, focused. But it's got the intention to get brought into antibodies and small molecules. However, the first thing to keep in mind is that, in parallel, they decided immediately— sort of a little bit— go against it in the unicure situation relating to Huntington's disease. At the end, you can argue that some of these elements would apply to Unicure, and that was sort of set in motion. We talked about this last week in detail, and now they seem to go in against what was already agreed on with the previous team.\n\n00:07:09,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n So this is basically a: you need to have a biologically defined cause that is pathogenic, with a specific mutation or target, characterized by natural history. You need to show that you can successfully engage and target it specifically. They're talking about gene editing or mRNA sort of therapies. You could use animal or non-animal models, if applicable. And you could do invasive or, preferably, non-invasive methods for confirmation.\n\n00:07:37,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n You need to have a clinical outcome that's consistent with improvement when there's progressive deterioration. Or a disease-free course if the disease waxes and wanes. And the FDA will even consider the patient as a natural history as their own control. The goal is to even have single patient sort of expanded access to generate sufficient data to support marketing approvals. This is where now it starts getting a little vague and sort of aspirational. That they're saying that even if you can start with one patient and have several consecutive patients that are successful, that could lead to marketing authorization.\n\n00:08:18,040 [SPEAKER_2]\n Then they talk about you can use that as a platform technology for a personalized product to support similar therapies in other conditions. Exactly what that means. It's unclear. And you can support potentially accelerated or regular approval. And then of course, there's post-marketing commitments to look at safety, as you know. In risk mitigation.","char_start":3654,"char_end":7951,"start_time":"00:04:24","end_time":null}

In risk mitigation.\n\n00:08:40,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n But. Where it's a little confusing is exactly how broad can one patient really lead to approval? What do they need by a few patients? What do they need by platform to then, you know, lead to kind of broader approval? And they even mention a situation where, let's say you have a disease with 150 mutations, is the example they're giving, that ultimately have a common symptomatological manifestation that's addressed with this therapy that it could lead to approval for all mutants. So let's say this certainly is a positive development, but let's see how they implement it.\n\n00:09:20,080 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think that's a great summary, Yaron. I also wonder if it's, you know, for the baby KJ.\n\n00:09:31,789 [SPEAKER_1]\n Examples very narrowly defined, and, you know, as you know, there are many end-of-1 efforts that are out there. I'm involved with and Laura. which is the effort using antisense oligos that Stan Crook has pioneered. There's also another couple of groups out there that are really looking at. at end of one type of tailored therapies. I think the scope of this plausible mechanism.\n\n00:10:01,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n aspiration is something which I think remains to be seen. It'll be probably really important to see how it gets written into guidelines ultimately to understand. Understand, um, you know what the breadth and the scope is of of all this, and um, you know, obviously, does it apply to a unicure like situation that certainly seems at odds to what was written here in terms of what we all understand. So I think we'll have to see how that gets defined at the guidance. I don't know if others, Amy, Drew, Allison, do you have anything to add?\n\n00:10:36,320 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think I could sort of I kind of agree with you that, you know, this is really positive in the sense that it encourages Innovation.\n\n00:10:45,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n But how it gets implemented is really going to be important because if it's used inappropriately, then it could lead to.\n\n00:10:54,290 [SPEAKER_4]\n you know, safety or efficacy failures and maybe that could sort of. put a setback to what this is intended to be.\n\n00:11:03,790 [SPEAKER_4]\n I'd also be curious to understand how peers would view this, and how much of evidence that they would need to see and how pricing gets determined based off of that.\n\n00:11:16,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I think that's a super important point. Obviously, you know, even with accelerated approval pathway drugs, there's always been the question around any implications on the payer side of it. And so, you know, that'll have to be watched pretty carefully as this thing gets rolled out. There's no doubt about that. Anything from Drew or Allison on it or?\n\n00:11:37,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n I wanted to echo something and expand on something Aaron said, which is just this idea and this theme that I feel like we've seen over and over again. This year, which is that there's a headline policy that people really seem to like and are excited by. And then the actual execution, from a regulatory standpoint, seems to run counter to that over and over again.\n\n00:12:03,250 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know. People keep looking for, that I chat through too, are looking for some kind of consistent regulatory philosophy or approach, and it keeps kind of being contradicted by their own actions. I think that's starting to really get to people now that we've seen a couple of repeats of it. And it's starting to create some, I think, meaningful concern that we might not get to a really stable, consistent path forward on some of this stuff and some doubts when we see these new policies roll out.\n\n00:12:33,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, it's a super valid point, Drew. And, you know, there's been some Wall Street Journal editorial board op-eds on this exact topic.

Maybe we can segue to one of the other big events that happened this week, and that's the That's the Maha Summit. So, Alison, I think you covered it very nicely, but I'd love to hear what you've learned about that gathering and maybe provide some context for the call.\n\n00:13:14,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sure. Yeah. So we started hearing.\n\n00:13:20,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n Tuesday morning. That hundreds of people, including you know, members of the regulatory body, you know, NIH, FDA. JD Vance, RFK Jr., Secretary Kennedy, and members of our biotech community were going to be meeting in D. C. to have the inaugural Maha Summit. There was a schedule that we were able, myself and my colleague Daniel Payne, were able to get our hands on.\n\n00:13:50,890 [SPEAKER_3]\n After Politico was kind of the first, I should give a little hat tip to them, to disclose that this summit was happening. And.\n\n00:13:57,700 [SPEAKER_3]\n Taking a look at the documents that we were able to get, the invitations, the agenda, it was really pitched as, you know, exclusive gathering of kind of people, people in the know in various sectors, mixing and mingling and networking. And we saw a whole series— there's a whole day of uh events, of sessions featuring, you know, some of our the people that we know well in the biotech industry, uh over at you know, CRISPR, Sam Cole Kearney. took the stage along with Alexis Boracy and George Yancopoulos, where I understand that baby KJ was a topic of conversation and also, you know, Sam talking about what CRISPR is able to do to address and really treat very efficiently sickle cell disease.\n\n00:14:45,900 [SPEAKER_3]\n That took you know kind of, was center stage. Saw. Some conversation about oral GLP-1s hitting the market. Dr. Oz said that this could happen as early as March. And it's worth noting that Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1 candidate, Orpha Glipron, recently received one of the commissioner's vouchers for review, expedited review. And interestingly, I think this was a notable absence from what we were able to gather. From people who were in attendance, it was that vaccines really weren't much of a topic; it was really I think focused a little bit more on kind of general food, lifestyle, general health trends. Even some brain-computer interface conversation, apparently, there is a panel. With a neural link. With the CEO of Neuralink involved, that got some cheers. And it was really a full day summit on Wednesday.\n\n00:15:42,750 [SPEAKER_3]\n Where, you know, kind of Maha.\n\n00:15:45,770 [SPEAKER_3]\n I would venture kind of took a little bit of a you gave yourself a little bit of a pat on the back for some of the work that they've been doing and talked about their vision for what's to come. And handed out some goodie bags with some you know beef tallow potato crisps.\n\n00:16:01,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Alison, was there, was there, were you actually there or was there any media coverage, presence at the meeting or was it closed?\n\n00:16:09,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n This was interesting. It was a closed. It was a closed. Media events, uh, are invite-only. From what I understand, and I say that— not even just that— members of media organizations that the administration might not have invited, like weren't invited, no, essentially no media was invited even. You know, Fox News and some organizations that you know the administration likes, the one exception was, uh, Vice President Vance's, uh, he gave a fireside chat kind of midday, right around lunchtime. Uh, CNN had like the pool coverage that day, which means that they had it, kind of their turn to have first access to what, to cover what Vance was doing and talking about. So his JD Vance's session was broadcast. That was the only session. So everything that we were hearing about was from. uh people on the ground and I do have to say that one of my colleagues, uh, Chelsea, uh, was in the venue.","char_start":11547,"char_end":15801,"start_time":"00:12:33","end_time":null}

Invitae invited to no— i didn't get else and i i wouldn't i wouldn't have gotten invited i didn't get invited so it's all good.\n\n00:17:39,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n Well, I can tell you it's been very successful in the sense that now I'm actually looking up what are these chips.\n\n00:17:47,760 [SPEAKER_2]\n And I might actually even try them. So at least they're going to get maybe one sale out of this.\n\n00:17:53,160 [SPEAKER_3]\n I've been told that they taste like normal potato chips, to be quite honest.\n\n00:17:59,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n I love it. Well, fantastic. That's really helpful, Allison. Thanks for that coverage of that event. Let's move on to some data and company. news. And I want to start with Alkermes. And there's also some interesting business deal news on Alkermes as well. But let's start with their Vibrance 2 data for their orexin agonist. Amy, do you want to cover that?\n\n00:18:27,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, sure.\n\n00:18:28,720 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yes, so this week we received the much-anticipated Vibrance 2 data from Alkermes for their orexin 2 agonist. In NT2, which is narcolepsy type 2. And this was the first robust data set in this population with data in over 90 patients.\n\n00:18:45,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n Earlier this month, Sintesa had reported data from their orexin program in NT1 to NIH.\n\n00:18:52,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n But it was from a relatively smaller data set.\n\n00:18:55,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now, the altimeter results now provide kind of a strong evidence that the orexin agonists can deliver meaningful clinical benefit beyond just NT1. In a heterogeneous population like Antito.\n\n00:19:08,760 [SPEAKER_4]\n And this also strengthens the broader thesis around this class and the applicability and other larger neurologic populations, such as, you know, beyond just IH, but also into MS and Parkinson's, certainly at least builds towards that.\n\n00:19:24,150 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now there was some debate about kind of how this data stacks up. And there was some cross-trial comparisons that were being done.\n\n00:19:34,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n Which to some people may have suggested, you know, a lower placebo-adjusted improvement in MWT for the Alkermes data relative to what we had seen from Sintessa.\n\n00:19:46,660 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now, you know, in Vibrance 2, Alexa Raxton achieved a placebo-adjusted change in MWT of 9. 3, 6. 7, and 6. 7 minutes for the three doses they tested of 10, 14, and 18 milligrams at week six. And in comparison, the Sintesa data had shown over 10 minutes of change at week two.\n\n00:20:12,670 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now, while I think that it's expected that people are going to compare data across trials. But I think there are two caveats that I think are worth mentioning. Firstly, it's sample size.\n\n00:20:27,580 [SPEAKER_4]\n Alkremizid enrolled 93 patients, whereas from Sintesa, we got the data from 10 patients.\n\n00:20:34,150 [SPEAKER_4]\n And given the heterogeneity in the NT2 population, I think that a larger data set probably is critical and really fully characterizing the treatment effect.\n\n00:20:44,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n And then, secondly, there's treatment duration. The algorithm's data had been reported at week eight versus week two for Sintesa.\n\n00:20:52,290 [SPEAKER_4]\n And at this point, we don't fully know— how long or how much of tachyphylaxis emerges and how long it takes to reach steady state.\n\n00:21:03,040 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think we're going to need to continue to sort of watch how these data emerge over time.\n\n00:21:08,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um. The other key efficacy endpoint was ESS, which better captures the patient's subjective experience of sleepiness.\n\n00:21:17,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n And probably is a more relevant regulatory endpoint, especially in the EU.","char_start":15501,"char_end":19921,"start_time":"00:17:10","end_time":null}

So I think, you know, it'll be important to see.\n\n00:21:50,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n how these data evolve over time as these companies continue to dose escalate and pursue higher doses and split dosing.\n\n00:22:00,060 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, interestingly, on safety, we solve a very consistent on-target profile. The main adverse events for insomnia and urinary urgency.\n\n00:22:12,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n And importantly, visual disturbances were less frequent than you know, what we saw with the alchemist data in NT1 population.\n\n00:22:21,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n And what this means is that perhaps in NT2, it allows these companies to continue to explore higher doses. And potentially also explore split-dosing strategies. And we've seen both companies talk about doing that.\n\n00:22:38,230 [SPEAKER_4]\n So overall, I'd say that this class continues to remain highly compelling.\n\n00:22:44,420 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, we continue to expect I think multiple companies to reach market, although it's still a little early to know if there's any one player that will dominate the market.\n\n00:22:55,510 [SPEAKER_4]\n And perhaps, you know, the real differentiation could come from other endpoints, like secondary endpoints around cognition or nighttime sleep.\n\n00:23:03,260 [SPEAKER_4]\n Maybe, you know, we need to look at how the dosing flexibility ends up, and maybe ultimately it's time to market and pair dynamics as well.\n\n00:23:10,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that's great and helpful, Amy. Do you want to comment, since we're on the topic of Alkermes, do you want to comment on the competitive situation with Lundbeck making a $2. 6 billion bid for Avidel, which had previously been announced to be acquired by Alkermes for $2. 1 billion. What are your thoughts there?\n\n00:23:35,710 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I think it's interesting. And I think we are seeing this is sort of a second recent case that we are seeing where, you know, there's bidding.\n\n00:23:43,180 [SPEAKER_4]\n And I think overall it's good to see M&A heating up.\n\n00:23:48,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think in the case of Avadel, Um. It's interesting to see how the deals were structured, I think, in the alchemies. Deal offer—uh, you know, I think they had—uh— an upfront payment of $80. 50 and a CVR of $1. 50, linked to approval of hydropathic hypersomnia indication for which they're going to have phase three data next year.\n\n00:24:15,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n Whereas the LUMMEC deal structure, you know, out of the 23 bucks includes $2 of CVR.\n\n00:24:25,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n Which are linked to sales performance milestones at, you know, 2027 and 2030.\n\n00:24:32,250 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, it'll be interesting to see how this evolves. Uh, you know, alchemy is sort of immediately put out a press release this morning that they're considering their options. I'd be surprised if they don't come back.\n\n00:24:45,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n With um, at least a counter offer and, perhaps, you know, there's opportunity even within the total. Deal value of 23 bucks to improve.\n\n00:24:59,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n The attractiveness of the deal.\n\n00:25:02,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n So yeah, I think this is an emerging situation.\n\n00:25:07,490 [SPEAKER_4]\n We're going to see more come through in the next couple of days, I think.\n\n00:25:11,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, and amazing that this is now the second recent example of an interloper coming in after an out-steal, and we'll talk about Metzera. In just a minute, but, you know, do you view, Amy, do you view any potential more limited FTC challenges with Lundbeck versus Alkermes, given the orexin program that Alkermes has? Is that one angle that Lundbeck has articulated?\n\n00:25:42,690 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, uh.\n\n00:25:46,050 [SPEAKER_4]\n It's certainly a possibility, but I mean, these are completely different mechanisms.","char_start":19621,"char_end":24025,"start_time":"00:21:08","end_time":null}

I. I don't know if that necessarily. You know, one is a scheduled drug, the other will not be.\n\n00:26:01,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n One is nighttime, one is daytime. And then, you know, there's sort of a broader opportunity with the orexin. Platform compared to the OxoBait.\n\n00:26:11,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n And particularly with, you know. There being competition in the Oxabate market and there. There are going to be additional generic versions of. Zyrem that are going to launch early part of next year. I don't know how much pricing power in the Oxibate market.\n\n00:26:27,240 [SPEAKER_4]\n Alkremes could have simply because they've got an orexin as well. Yeah. I don't know if they're, aside from, yeah, they're both targeting sleep. I don't know if. It truly gives them more pricing power.\n\n00:26:40,930 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah. OK, well, let's let's let's then move on to the other recent competitive deal. And that's Andrew just. this morning wrote a really fantastic story about the Pfizer-Metsera acquisition. And I'm one of the original people that was involved in helping Metsera get started. So I thought Drew's reporting was great. Drew, do you want to comment on that?\n\n00:27:11,120 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, this was, if you haven't read the story, it's on our front page over at Endpoint. It's worth checking out. I think, you know. I'm always, we cover deals all the time. I'm always interested whenever we get a look inside the boardroom and the high intensity negotiations that are going on, because I think, you know, maybe a lot of people on this call have been able to be a part of those, but for a lot of folks who work in biotech, you know, this is really a closed door. environment I think it told us though a couple of I mean, I think one, we learned a lot about. Know those motivations, and you know— this was a case where we had two big companies that really needed to find out how to get their vibe back, essentially. Pfizer's been looking for its post-pandemic move for a long time. Um and you know, they'd had a failure in obesity. Novo had really lost the obesity early lead and the crown there, and so you had two companies that really, really, really needed this.\n\n00:28:13,160 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think that's what's fascinating to just see how you know aggressively they were going after this particular asset. I think it leaves us with a great question about what Novo does next, because nothing about their situation has changed. Um, I think some folks may have seen—uh. You know, Pfizer taking a small bit of additional revenge on them this morning. They're at Pfizer's former head of R&D, Michael Bolston, who was supposed to join the NOVA board and get voted up to that today. Last second, he pulled his own nomination. And our understanding is that Pfizer raised some objections about that. So this was kind of a deeply nasty and, you know, at times personal. Almost a fight between these companies. I think the other piece of this that's really interesting— and Amy alluded to some of this—is that. We've all been waiting for a really long time to see if we were going to get a good first look at how the Trump administration is going to approach antitrust in biopharma. I think we caught a glimpse of that here, but in some ways it's tainted by, I'm going to speculate here, but maybe tainted a little bit by Pfizer and Borla's close relationship with this administration.","char_start":23725,"char_end":27440,"start_time":"00:25:42","end_time":null}

I don't know how heavily they were actually able to lean on this, but if you look in the proxy documents, the FTC called Metzera on the final day of this. This was November 7th. It basically said, if you try to do this deal, we're going to sue. And so I think we got close to getting a real glimpse on this, but they were more focused, I think, on the structure of the offer and the kind of unusual way of putting this transaction in place. Rather than actually the anti-competitive aspect. So I was hopeful there. I think we still don't know, but I do think it is something that's going to be interesting to watch closely. If we start to see more M&A happen around the space. And I will also just highlight our cousins over at the Financial Times.\n\n00:30:16,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Some reporting last night, I believe, about the Merck Siddhartha deal, suggesting that there was another bidder up until the very last minute in that transaction as well. I don't know if we see something go public, but it seems like all of a sudden we're moving away from single bidders, CVRs to get things across the line into competitive and at times nastily competitive situations. So I think the last two months of the year, last month and a half of the year are going to be fascinating from an M &A standpoint.\n\n00:30:49,090 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I mean, it just highlights the intense interest from pharma in biotech assets and probably recognition that this is the time. to either buy them or lose them at the end of the day. Why don't we then, just because you mentioned it, Drew, why don't, Jeroen, do you want to talk about Merck Sedara? Because that just happened this morning. That was another big piece of news, yet another $10 billion acquisition, which is fantastic.\n\n00:31:16,240 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yep. So Merck is continuing their recent playbook. What they're doing is continuing to build up their cardio, in this case, really pulmonary capabilities with a late stage asset. It's got breakthrough status with a strong phase 2B. to help the Keytruda LOE, which we all know is 2028. So, Sidaro is getting bought for $9. 2 billion. It's 3x their recent market cap. And again, remember, Merck is increasingly going into pulmonary with a recent Verona deal, obviously the previous Acceleron deal. A closing is expected in the first quarter of next year. So what are they buying? They're buying a drug called CD388. It's a long-acting, strain-agnostic antiviral. So it's a neuroaminidase inhibitor. But it's tagged to a proprietary FC fragment. So it's essentially creating a long-acting, low molecular weight biologic with an antiviral for a one-season preventative for influenza A and B, so seasonal and pandemic.\n\n00:32:20,420 [SPEAKER_2]\n The phase 2B looked really good. It showed a 60 to 76% protection against lab-confirmed flu with a single shot. So recall, a typical seasonal vaccine, they're on 40 to 50%. Phase three is ongoing and the data is expected. This is the anchor study in the high-risk adults and adolescents. The data is expected in the first quarter of next year. So yeah, that, I mean, the data looks the phase 2b looked really really good and um.\n\n00:32:50,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n So it's nice that Mark continues to be fairly aggressive and active.\n\n00:32:54,940 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:32:56,480 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'll just add on.

Go ahead.\n\n00:32:59,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, go ahead, Allison.\n\n00:33:00,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n I was just going to add on to expand a little bit on that. We had Dean Lee, one of the executives at Merck. Um, their head of research on our podcast that sat the read out loud this week and he we were asking him about kind of this precise issue of how is merck looking to the future, you know, kind of post Keytruda and that patent cliff that they are facing. We were talking in particular about their work in heart disease with their PCSK9 oral medicine. But he was, you know, Dean was indicating that Merck's strategy is not going to be, you know, kind of one searching for one big product that they are looking to do. An assortment of deals and have an assortment of products that they will bring into the company over the next couple of years to help kind of backfill some of that patent cliff and then even grow on that.\n\n00:33:52,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n00:33:54,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, it's good to see these transactions. We had another very interesting deal this week, and I can sort of tee it up and then see if other people have comments on it. But it was the acquisition of of Mursana by Day One, dawn. And what's unusual is. It's a relatively small size, you know, midsize, barely midsize biotech, you know, Dawn with about a billion dollar market cap buying Mursana, which had been, you know, challenged, I think, in its story. But, you know, certainly one of the pioneers on the on the.\n\n00:34:34,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n ADC side, but they went ahead and they acquired, they put an offer to acquire and was agreed upon Mursana and largely for its BSAT. 7H4 ADC.\n\n00:34:47,929 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, for Dawn, for Day One, it obviously is an effort to build on their first commercial product, which is Ojemda, which is an oral brain penetrant ref, kinase inhibitor, which showed stunning data in pediatric low-grade glioma, really terrible indication, but relatively small market, of course. And in addition to that, product, they do have their own ADC efforts. So they grabbed Mursana and, you know, obviously are consolidating that effort within Dawn, but it's not usual for us to see smaller biotech acquisitions taking place. So that was, I think, a bit notable in this one. I don't know if anybody had any other observations or thoughts on that deal. To follow up on.\n\n00:35:41,400 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think I could add that. I think it was interesting also how the deal was structured. I think it's sort of.\n\n00:35:49,850 [SPEAKER_4]\n giving the mid-sized or the smaller biotechs the ability to acquire and build their pipeline.\n\n00:35:57,650 [SPEAKER_4]\n With you know a low upfront and you know majority of the deal value was you know is linked to development and regulatory milestones. So I think it allows day one to get access to this drug without paying a huge amount upfront.\n\n00:36:18,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, the other thing that was interesting is I think it's a differentiated asset. There are a lot of companies that are pursuing V7H4.\n\n00:36:27,839 [SPEAKER_4]\n But a lot of them are really going after ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer.\n\n00:36:35,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n And that's probably where, you know, Marsana was also expanding the cohorts. But the main anchor of the deal for day one is really the ACC indication, which is sort of a rare, you know, cancer in the salivary gland.\n\n00:36:52,850 [SPEAKER_4]\n Where the expression of B7H4 is actually quite high, you know, around 94%. And the data there was actually quite compelling.\n\n00:37:00,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n Where they showed about 55. 6% response rate in that subset.\n\n00:37:07,600 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think it gives Daylon Um. a unique way to go after a rare disease.\n\n00:37:15,630 [SPEAKER_4]\n Even though you know as such, the b7h4 market is pretty crowded with a lot of large pharma pursuing other indications with it. So I thought that was interesting.\n\n00:37:25,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, that's super interesting. Well, why don't we move back to some data readouts from the field? And Amy, if you could maybe comment on Neurocrine's unfortunate news about their MDD program.

That would be helpful place to start.\n\n00:37:42,730 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sure. So, yeah, on Monday, New York announced its phase two data from its signal seeking study of NBI 770.\n\n00:37:52,010 [SPEAKER_4]\n Which is a negative allosteric modulator of NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor.\n\n00:38:00,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n It was a 73-patient study in MDD and did not reach its primary endpoint.\n\n00:38:07,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n The company did note, in its press release, that there are some aspects of the dataset that warrant further analysis before determining next steps.\n\n00:38:17,090 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um. You know, the interesting thing is that the broader NMDA pathway has been long pursued in depression, especially with the strong and rapid activity we've seen with ketamine and esketamine. But the mechanisms are different. You know, with ketamine, it involves a broad blockade of the NMDA receptor.\n\n00:38:39,780 [SPEAKER_4]\n While with this particular drug, you know it's sort of targeting kind of a subset of that, and and so, the goal is to sort of spare PV plus interneurons, which cause the dissociation effect that we see with ketamine.\n\n00:39:03,620 [SPEAKER_4]\n But it seems that maybe this is sort of failing to trigger the full circuit level changes that are required for, you know, the robust antidepressant activity that we would have liked to see.\n\n00:39:16,000 [SPEAKER_4]\n You know, we've seen a long history of failures in this space.\n\n00:39:19,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n Uh and and so, you know, with this data set, the question is: Well, maybe, you know, that's the reason that we're just not seeing the broad activity that is needed. You know, around AMPA, mTOR, BDNF that you need for antidepressant or, whether maybe this was just sort of a small multi-armed study that was sort of underpowered. To see the rapid effect that they find that they had designed it to. So I think we're going to need to see what you know— the company sort of reveals after further analysis. Um, but you know, for the time being, I think the outlook on this mechanism is. You know, probably less attractive.\n\n00:40:03,820 [SPEAKER_1]\n Such a tough, such a tough space and enormous unmet need. I hope we can catch a break. One of these days, no doubt about it. Um, let's turn to some news from the American Heart Meeting, which happened this past week and over the weekend as well. It's actually pretty um action or data-filled meeting by by aha comparisons and um, one of the readouts that was really quite interesting was the CRISPR program with Ang PTL3. Your own, do you want to comment on that a little bit?\n\n00:40:38,300 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. And maybe just to throw in there, and I'll touch, maybe quickly, IONIS had really good Olazarsson SHTG data, and of course, Amgen had the Vasilis, right? CV primary prevention. So let's start to your point on CRISPR. So CRISPR showed data with their EngPTL3.\n\n00:40:58,310 [SPEAKER_2]\n S9 in vivo, 15 patients with high cholesterol, high lipids, and mixed dyslipidemia on maximal background therapy, single IV infusion. Data looked really, really good. And it's really encouraging. And again, this is also relevant to what Ionis is doing. So NGPTL3. He's trying to reduce this lipidemia by having the muscle and other tissues outside the liver actually do the metabolism, which is different from what I and Arrowhead are doing. So it showed a 73% reduction in angio-PTL3 dose dependence. It was nice to see that. A 55% reduction in lipids, almost a 50% reduction in LDL, 33% reduction in APOB, and about a 50% reduction in non-HDL.\n\n00:41:50,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n And participants who came in with sort of lower, above 150 levels of lipids showed a 60% reduction. So really, really good. overall. And then, if you look at people who actually had a PCSK9 inhibitor, they got sort of upwards of more than 80% reduction in LDL. Um, the big thing, and I think, John, you're going to want to, it sounds like you're going to tie, you know, later on, we're going to talk about and tell you on the patient issue that died there.\n\n00:42:17,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, why don't we just merge those?

Why don't we just merge those? together.\n\n00:42:20,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n We can merge them. Yeah. So safety looked okay. I mean, there was no treatment-related SAEs, no grade three liver enzyme elevation. 20% had grade 2 reversible infusion reactions. One participant had grade 2 transaminitis resolving by day 14, but there was one death, which was reported not judged to be related to treatment. They are planning on now moving into a phase 1b. It was published in the New England Journal, and the New England Journal is calling for a 15-year, obviously, in vivo genome editing sort of surveillance.\n\n00:42:58,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n So again, data looks really good. You got to put this in context because you can take an antibody from Regeneron and you can take other ASOs or siRNAs. um, which will require obviously more continuous dosing, frequent dosing, not one and done. But. Let's discuss now Intelia. So Intelia, just literally this week and two weeks ago, had the unfortunate situation. They were in phase three for ATTR cardiomyopathy, something very close to John's heart. This is a CRISPR-based therapy. So they actually dosed over 650 patients in the magnitude one and two studies before less than 1% had grade four liver enzyme elevations. In magnitude two, that only enrolled about 47 patients. And they didn't have any. So what happened? Well, In late September, sadly, one elderly male in his 80s, in the first magnitude, died.\n\n00:44:01,020 [SPEAKER_2]\n He basically was hospitalized with grade four transaminitis, increased also bilirubin increase, clearly markers of liver injury. And then, a few days later, this was announced on October 27th. At that point, they went on clinical hold on the 29th. and they announced that the patient sadly passed away in it looks like around November 5th. So this program is now on clinical hold. And recall, Invutra, which John developed, is an incredible product, Q3 months dosing, approved now, you know, based on the Helios study.\n\n00:44:39,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n And of course, Ionis and AstraZeneca are behind. They're going to read out their CardioTransforms study probably in Q3 next year, also for cardiomyopathy. That's an outpatient sort of auto-injector monthly.\n\n00:44:52,500 [SPEAKER_2]\n So it really begs the question, do you really need a CRISPR-Cas9? And sort of, what's the venue by which this comes back at this point?\n\n00:45:02,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah. Big overhang.\n\n00:45:04,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, it is. It is a challenge. It is a challenge. And obviously, the CRISPR NGPTL3 data and the death, you know, while graded as unrelated. It's odd that that would be happening in a population like the initial population they aimed to study. So I think we're gonna have to learn more to understand more at the end of the day. I do wanna talk. On a sort of related, but not totally related topic, which is the work that Coral reported this week on their Alpha-1 at the Trypsin deficiency program, their effort is focused on RNA editing, which is a reversible. Uh, approach it. It harnesses the 8r enzyme in cells to um achieve base editing, and and um, you know, we in 2024 there were some promising data from Wave Life Sciences on alpha, alpha one of the trips, and um, base editing, um which you know they updated a little bit recently, which looked a little bit more confusing.\n\n00:46:12,520 [SPEAKER_1]\n But Coro chose an LNP-based approach, and it had very promising preclinical data, but it did not meet the thresholds in that study and their rewrite study, which is a phase one, two study that they did. And they chose. I think smartly does to discontinue the program in light of not only the data that they generated, but also the competitive landscape, you know, because of wave. and also other players out there. There's a company called Erna, as well as what Beam is doing with base editing at the DNA level.","char_start":38855,"char_end":42988,"start_time":"00:42:17","end_time":null}

They got penalized as a stock, but we're going to see if they can pull it all together. which I hope they do, with their program in urea cycle disorder. But that was also some other news. And then maybe, Amy, you can quickly cover, because we're running out of time a little bit, the cogent news in gist with those programs.\n\n00:47:15,500 [SPEAKER_4]\n Sure. You know, this fall, it seems like we're seeing several companies double their market cap at the back of positive data readouts. You know, earlier last month, we saw Praxis and my coverage universe do that. And this week it was Cogent, where they delivered standout dataset in GIST.\n\n00:47:35,990 [SPEAKER_4]\n In the first line, the therapy ingest is Gleevec, which has a PFS of almost 19 months. Bye. The response quickly goes down significantly once you hit second line.\n\n00:47:52,170 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, sort of the standard of care in second line is sunitinib and, you know, has the PFS of about a little over eight months.\n\n00:48:01,200 [SPEAKER_4]\n So what Kojian did was combine Bezuklasne! uh with sunitinib. And what Bezu does is it offers a complementary mutational coverage. It targets exon 1, kit exon 17 and 18.\n\n00:48:15,950 [SPEAKER_4]\n Whereas Sunitinib targets exon 13 and 14.\n\n00:48:20,450 [SPEAKER_4]\n And in the phase three peak study that they announced, they reported median PFS of 16. 5 months. This is pretty impressive relative to about nine months that were shown by Sunitinib.\n\n00:48:33,550 [SPEAKER_4]\n And an overall response rate of 45. 6% versus 25% for Sunitinib.\n\n00:48:39,980 [SPEAKER_4]\n Now, I mean, the enthusiasm is warranted, particularly given, you know, the history of GIST. It's sort of been a graveyard for target oncology programs where several drugs that had promising data in phase one, two ended up failing in larger trials.\n\n00:48:58,020 [SPEAKER_4]\n One I can, you know, obviously seen recent is Deciphera's Quinlock.\n\n00:49:04,160 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, drug that failed in their phase three trial and then there are a couple others in the past.\n\n00:49:10,840 [SPEAKER_4]\n And, you know, from a commercial standpoint, you know, this is sort of a four billion plus market opportunity.\n\n00:49:18,240 [SPEAKER_4]\n Given about 3,000 patients that are in second line.\n\n00:49:22,700 [SPEAKER_4]\n And following the data, it was good to see Codian's market cap increased about two and a half times, and they were also able to raise capital at the back of that with a $200 million equity offering and $200 million convertible. So I think it's just good to see positive data. and companies being able to you know capitalise themselves to continue to sort of develop the programmes in the future.\n\n00:49:50,790 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, it's certainly a sign of the markets coming back, which we're also seeing more generally with the XBI, when companies can get rewarded for good data and robustly raise capital. as a result of it. There are a couple other topics we want to just cover, and then we'll do a wrap-up. I mean, we did see this past week. Actually, it was, I believe, Friday. last week, but perhaps after the last hangout was recorded, the passing of James Watson.\n\n00:50:21,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n obviously lived a very long life, age of 97. He was the co-discoverer of DNA, the structure of DNA, along with Francis Crick.\n\n00:50:30,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n The last of the key scientists who were involved in the discovery of the structure of DNA to have survived. I mean, that includes Watson and Crick, of course. Franklin and Wilkins and even Linus Pauling. So it is the end of a generation of scientists that serve as the foundation for most of everything we do. I mean, his remarkable scientific career unfortunately was just clouded by a history of unacceptable comments that were both bigoted and prejudiced. And he was ultimately shunned by the scientific community because of his behavior, if you will, which I think. appropriately, people found unacceptable.","char_start":42688,"char_end":47033,"start_time":"00:46:49","end_time":null}

But, you know, unfortunately, his His history was a little bit challenged, I would say. I actually had the chance to meet him once, and he knew about El Milam. He knew about our efforts— advancing RNAi. And the one thing he said to me was, John, you know, just go fast. It was good advice, I guess.\n\n00:51:45,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n So anyway, RIP, Jim, and I hope you find peace in your next chapter. The last thing I want to cover is. Something which was fascinating this week, which is a podcast with Dave Ricks on 'Cheeky Pint,' which I had never heard of before.\n\n00:52:05,589 [SPEAKER_1]\n This was brought to my attention. It's a podcast that's done by John Collison. And I haven't listened to the full two hours of this podcast. But I listened to a good chunk of it. And it's actually a really remarkable interview that covers a far-reaching set of subjects— from R&D to glyphs, to drug pricing.\n\n00:52:27,140 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I was really struck with how amazingly well and authentically Dave Ricks explains our industry in this podcast.\n\n00:52:38,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n I hope there's more of this because it's just— it's so important. Podcast is such an important way to to speak to the public these days. But I just. I also was really proud of Dave and how well he did this. I don't know if any of the other speakers on the Hangout here listened to this as well, but I'd love your thoughts if you did.\n\n00:53:01,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n We were definitely chatting about it on the stat Slack this week, particularly what was the line that he had about, you know, if Taylor Swift can sell out. X number of arenas. We can certainly enroll. X trials.\n\n00:53:19,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah.\n\n00:53:21,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n As someone who has, like, we've had Jay Bricks on the podcast at STAT. He is a very good public speaker and he clearly has tapped into the fact that he needs to be speaking to the consumers, not just to kind of his peers and and people in healthcare, but to the consumers. I found it really interesting. Also because I had had a conversation recently with Kathy Friedman. Over at GV, and she was talking about how you know her view of what's happening. She's like, 'This is— we are in an era where you know healthcare is becoming more and more consumerized, and so I think that you know the the type of stance that Dave took to go on a podcast that is, you know, it's not it's not for you and me and Drew and your own and Amy. It's it's for the average person who may not know how our ecosystem works. And, you know, to speak so, you know, so candidly was really a smart move.\n\n00:54:25,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, I'll tell you, like I said, I would love to see more of it because we need to connect with the broader public.' In better ways. We all know that. As an industry, we've done a horrible job communicating what we do and why it matters and why it's good. And I thought that was a really terrific start from Dave.\n\n00:54:49,990 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, look, we've only got a few minutes left. I want to leave some time for people to make some final comments. So let me just go around the horn here. Looks like Yaron has stepped off. So let me go to Drew next. Drew, do you want to?\n\n00:55:05,620 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, when you guys were talking about all these, something I've been thinking about a lot, looking at the data coming out of AHA, it's just fascinating to see this.\n\n00:55:15,630 [SPEAKER_0]\n Of new potential treatment modalities in cholesterol. I mean, we've gone from like statins to having a long-acting injectable PCSK9 biologic to now potentially.","char_start":46733,"char_end":50668,"start_time":"00:51:17","end_time":null}

And then, you know, now from Merck, potentially, you know, a small molecule, PCSK9. I mean, if you're treating high cholesterol or are a patient, I think it's pretty extraordinary. I think it's going to be fascinating to watch. The kind of commercial and scientific battle to see where these things find their place in the world and absolutely watching what that suggests about other diseases where we may see. A lot of different approaches where you know, efficacy doesn't always have to come with more complexity. Sometimes it will. But it's really, really cool to see. And I can't wait to see that battle between mechanisms start to unfold.\n\n00:56:17,370 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. Amy, anything to add?\n\n00:56:21,360 [SPEAKER_4]\n Um, yeah, I heard a little bit—uh, maybe about you know, half of the uh interview uh of David Rickson.\n\n00:56:30,010 [SPEAKER_4]\n I think I would recommend everybody on this podcast to also listen. Some of his comments about. How to drive transparency in pricing. While also not adversely impacting. The amount of effort that goes into research to develop new medicines and how do you sort of solve for that? And he sort of laid out a couple of ideas that he had— i thought that that was really interesting and that you know gets to the core of what is happening.\n\n00:57:04,149 [SPEAKER_4]\n um at the hill and you know what I think a lot of us sort of think about day in day out.\n\n00:57:09,970 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I agree, Amy. Allison, any last comments? before we wrap up here.\n\n00:57:17,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n I can't think of too much other than that, you know, we're looking to see who the next players in a bidding war. are going to be.\n\n00:57:25,060 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yes.\n\n00:57:25,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n Because we're certainly seeing more M &A.\n\n00:57:28,600 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, yeah, you bet. No, well, I mean, let's see if this Merck deal has a bidder that comes in, given what the FT was reporting. That would be super exciting, for sure.\n\n00:57:41,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, listen, everybody, thanks for taking the time. Have an amazing weekend.

I'm Eric Schmidt, and my co-hosts today are Jeroen Werber, Sam Fazelli, and Tess Cameron. For more information about our hosts and guest speakers, or to listen in to the most recent episode, please go to biotechhangout. com.\n\n00:00:23,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n OK, well, a busy week, maybe not. Quite as busy as we've had in the past, given we're past the earnings season. And I don't think there are any major medical meetings, but still plenty to talk about. Who better to talk about this stuff, of course, than and Jeroen, and Tess. So thanks, guys, for being part of this week's Hangout. We're going to start with a little bit of discussion of M&A, obviously. Mergers and acquisitions are something we've talked a lot about on this show, but boy, are things heating up. Um, another few deals to discuss, and of course, I'm coming off the heels of a major acquisition of CDTX last week. They then laid out their guidance surrounding the acquisition, meaning to them, but um, Jeroen, maybe you want to start off with the latest salvo. In the bid for Avondale.\n\n00:01:14,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:01:16,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, this is interesting. I gotta tell you, even for me, particularly personally, because I you know spent about three and a half years or so and I bought the company, and we were looking at orphan drugs, trying to license things. And we actually found these sort of drugs under development.\n\n00:01:32,760 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, a long time ago, necessarily, years ago, and we were trying to license them, but of course it was impossible because they were already looking so good that of course people didn't want to sell them to us. So, Abadel, we're talking about narcolepsy, and the drug specifically here is approved. It's called Lumerize. It's a once-nightly extended release. It's a sodium oxybate. For narcolepsy, it's the only ones at bedtime. Oxybait versus Jazz, uh, XYRAM, which twice nightly. I was approved in 2020, then got a pediatric expansion in 2024. So we're talking about this is sort of year two, you know, one or two into the launch. And this year it's going to be doing between 240 and 260 million in sales, up 50% year over year. Um, so pretty interesting and so ALCHEMY is actually um agreed to acquire Evadel on October 22nd for $20 a share. It was 18 and a half in cash and $1.\n\n00:02:34,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n 50 for a CVR. And if they get an FDA approval, for what's known as idiopathic hypersomnia. By the end of 28, idiopathic hypersomnia is actually very important. And Eric, you remember a lot of this market back. The days when you're covering Provigil and all that kind of stuff. So anyway, Alkermes wanted specifically as a beachhead because they do have an orexin 2 agonist.\n\n00:02:58,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n Uh, in development as well and there was actually a no-shopping super proposal, superior proposal, uh, language in the deal including matching right, which was obviously prescient and fairly wise. Well, three weeks later, Lundbeck showed up unannounced with a $23 bid up three bucks, essentially. was structured, funny enough, it was $21 in cash and a $2 CVR broken into two specific things, but those were a dollar each on the CVR for sales-based milestones. The board found that it's obviously a superior proposal, and that triggered a five-day, I believe, match to All Right.\n\n00:03:40,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n to Alkermes. So Alkermes came back and said, 'We'll match the 21 in cash, but we'll only give you $1. 50 in CVR.' So it's 50 cents less, but it's only only tied on approval again, same approval of IH by 2028 with no sales threshold.\n\n00:03:56,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n So the board said, 'Yep, that's good enough and we'll take it.'","char_start":0,"char_end":3859,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

It's what's expected. So, you know, great to see it. Alchemy said it's going to be accretive immediately. Just to put it in context, I mean, we're talking about a $2. 4 billion deal for a drug, let's say that's going to do $2. 50. So it sounds expensive, you know, 10 times. Sort of current year. But remember, that 250 is probably going to end up being, I don't know, I don't cover this area, but a lot higher. So if it's doing 5 to 750, it's a deal that's, you know, three and a half to five times. I'm pretty sensical and accretive year one. So, you know, kudos for Alchemist for getting this done. Seems to be getting this done.\n\n00:04:50,110 [SPEAKER_1]\n Did we lose Eric?\n\n00:04:54,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n I still see him. My bad. My bad.\n\n00:04:57,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n I was on. I'm here. Thank you.\n\n00:05:00,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n I was just for a few minutes at least, Sam. Thanks. Terrific recap. Thank you, Jeroen. I guess the significance of this in the biotech world is that it is now the second of two transactions that were very competitive, very publicly competitive, and with a lot of maybe even animosity across the parties. This following, obviously, last month's discussion around that Sarah and whether Pfizer or Novartis is going to want to grab that deal. And these types of publicly competitive options are the things that we rarely see. I can't actually remember the last one. Maybe you guys have better memories than I, but. It certainly speaks to a pretty heated M&A environment. And I know we also had, um, a fairly remarkable transaction in the private sector. How the therapeutics being bought by uh J & J for about $3 billion. I believe this is the largest ever. Phase one, stage, company acquisition—$3 billion for a phase one company. Sam, I don't know if you want to introduce the transaction or I can, but go ahead.\n\n00:06:04,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll take it. The one thing I do want to just highlight is don't forget the two bidding wars involved Danish companies.\n\n00:06:12,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n And I don't know if it's got anything to do with Greenland or not, but I'm testing, of course, Novo for Metera and here Lundbeck. But the J &J deal is very interesting. Is it the largest? I think the data that I've looked at suggests this could be, but I'm pretty sure one of our listeners following up on Twitter will probably tell us, no, you missed this one. That was 3. 1 or 3. 2. What is interesting, of course, is that this is J &J, i. e. the king of prostate cancer, at least in the small molecule world. And how times have changed. J &J paid the- billion for a phase three asset, which ended up being called Zytiga back in 2000 something, was it 2009, from Cougar Biotech. I'm sure you all remember that.\n\n00:07:02,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n and yeah, it was 2009. I've just checked and that was phase three. I said about the billion dollars here we are in phase one. I said about three billion dollars. Should we take a signal? I don't know. I mean, what all I'm telling you saying is that here's a deal. That is a company who knows about the space and they've got to pay this number. It is a HLD0915. It's a first in class. Or a small molecule hold and kill mechanism. So it binds together with the androgen receptor and then a key transcriptional factor, which then.\n\n00:07:36,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n The complex results in the cell. I think it's via apoptosis, but I'm sure Eric will correct me if it's not apoptosis. I think the data that we saw at the triple meeting for the late line, pretty much end stage, heavily pretreated prostate cancer patients was pretty impressive. It is an area where bispecifics, radioligands with a million different isotopes and ADCs— which are not convenient and we haven't really seen much— evidence that that that they are particularly super effective. They are, of course, to a degree, but here you come with a potential small molecule that you can combine with the rest of the assets that.","char_start":3561,"char_end":7867,"start_time":"00:03:56","end_time":null}

I know they have a very active prostate research space, at least. So this would have gone under, passed under the nose of, I'm pretty sure, Chuck Drake, who runs the research on prostate cancer there at J &J. And I think it's an attractive asset and it really does fit very well with the possibility of maybe even doing, I don't know if it's going to be possible to do a fixed-dose combination with another of the.\n\n00:08:54,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n Um small molecules that JJ has, but uh, it certainly helps with the um uh patent expiry that that is coming up again for another uh of JNJ assets in the uh soon so soonish so that that's what I would have those are the things that I've picked out of this Eric yeah no that that's terrific um I did actually I did actually have those uh those stats so this was the most expensive uh the the highest um you know the the highest priced acquisition for a company at that stage, I think the one the next one after that was Fellows Bio, which was back a couple of years ago, where Merck acquired them for 2. 75. So we did, we did look up those stats. And, you know, indeed, it's an impressive, you know, impressive, impressive M&A for a company at that stage.\n\n00:09:45,880 [SPEAKER_2]\n That's amazing exactly the point that uh Eric was talking about earlier which is um you know we're seeing in the you know in the public market certainly we're seeing more competition Looking at the statistics, I think this was up through 2024. Um, you know, most deals didn't have multiple first-round bidders, right? I think it was like— You know, if you look at the five years before 2024, these are stats that we got from Centerview. I think only 35 percent of deals had multiple first-round bidders, right? So it was really like, hey, you have your shot, and probably the party that that puts in the bid is going to win. And we do seem to be seeing heightened competition, very publicly in a few cases, which is also exceptional.\n\n00:10:35,200 [SPEAKER_2]\n But also in the SEC filings that are coming out post-deal. So. That's a real shift.\n\n00:10:47,890 [SPEAKER_2]\n Seeing that they have— you know, maybe a bit of a window where the FTC might be a bit more lenient on some of these deals. Also, if they see their peers getting very active, they get more concerned that they're going to have to be competitive as well to win the deals that they want.\n\n00:11:06,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n Do you know if this was a competitive bid? I mean, the numbers suggest it might have been competitive.\n\n00:11:14,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n My assumption for these private deals that happened, and I can't speak to this one because we were a holder here and we had team members who were involved. But, you know, whenever I see a private deal that is on the order of a few billion dollars or, you know, kind of over that over that one point five billion mark. My assumption is that those are typically competitive processes.\n\n00:11:42,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I have heard from others involved. I'm not involved, of course, so I can speculate. But I've heard that this was a nearly 10x return for the VCs who were involved. So congrats to RA and others.\n\n00:11:55,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n We saw the promise here. Sam, you were right to point out that. Know, relative to what Jay and Jay paid many many years ago for Cougar, I know that's the name that Jeroen and I had some involvement in back then, and we were quite thrilled at the time for a billion dollar acquisition for then a phase three asset.","char_start":7567,"char_end":11407,"start_time":"00:08:23","end_time":null}

But also the fact that Halde has a really cool technology platform, which of course Cougar never did. And Halda, I think it means 'hold'—maybe in, maybe in Danish, I don't know, or some old Norse-type language— but the technology itself means that you do hold and and kill and cancer cells specifically by sequestering tumor antigens to a essential cell protein and sequestering that essential cell protein from from the cells essential biology. And it's a really cool methodology. Obviously, it has been shown to have some proof of concept in terms of the data that you referenced from I think the triple meeting just a few weeks ago. Again, congrats to all involved. It's nice to see.\n\n00:13:00,620 [SPEAKER_3]\n So much M &A in this space. And Tess will give you a shout out. I know that RA Capital was very closely involved in the Sedara transaction that was announced just a week ago today with Mark paying nearly $10 billion.\n\n00:13:16,280 [SPEAKER_3]\n Uh, for that asset, CD388, for uh, for Laxus of Influenza, Mark did hold a discussion, I think it was on Monday of this week, about the transaction and gave some guidance. They put out some very, very high numbers for CD3AA. What should we make from this acquisition?\n\n00:13:38,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, my perspective here is obviously, and just, you know, I'll start with just a, you know, huge congratulations to Jeff Stein and, you know, and the Sedara team for really. you know, having the conviction to move this program forward very aggressively. um you know I think what there's several interesting learnings here. I think that Merck certainly saw the the promise of the drug, a very unique drug that can basically be a flu prevention.\n\n00:14:08,910 [SPEAKER_2]\n um and they came out with some pretty aggressive you know pretty aggressive peak sales numbers. And I thought what was really interesting is they In addition to talking about peak sales and talking about peak sales as being over $5 billion. Kind of going through the details of what supports that $5 billion market. And. You know, I think there's two things just to, you know, just to highlight. I think one is that they did really emphasize, 'hey, we're initially looking at these patients. who are high-risk patients.' But I think that's kind of point one. But also recognizing, 'hey, this could be relevant for a broader population as well.' Obviously, they will focus initially on that high-risk patient population. But then, the second point, and Eric, we've had conversations previously about the importance of companies doing work on cost-effectiveness and looking at cost-effectiveness broadly from a generalized cost-effectiveness standpoint.\n\n00:15:11,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Sadara had actually done a lot of that work and published some of that work. Shared some of that work on rapport. And Merck actually talked about that. So, you know, they talked about Sedara's pricing research and said that at price points up to $600 per course, this was very effective.\n\n00:15:33,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n And had the potential to not be subject to access restrictions. And I think that kind of comes back to the importance of like every company, no matter, you know, if you still have, you know, Sedara had a couple, you know, really big phase threes in front of it that they were going to run. And they really had the foresight of like doing a lot of this commercial work and thinking about the opportunity very thoroughly. Around the time of POC, when they had a good understanding of what the product profile could be. And that included thinking about patient populations, and that included thinking about pricing and really doing a robust GCEA analysis. And I think it just reinforces the importance of every company doing that.","char_start":11107,"char_end":15286,"start_time":"00:12:11","end_time":null}

But that's also really important for strategics, right? Everyone's working on tight timelines. And for you to have really thorough. you know, research supporting the opportunity and supporting a potential price point. That can really help a potential acquirer gain conviction. In a market opportunity.\n\n00:16:42,610 [SPEAKER_3]\n Thanks for that recap. Let's open up this broader discussion on M &A just to put some perspective on it. A few weeks ago, we had Novartis buying Vividi for $12 million.\n\n00:16:52,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n That I believe, and again, maybe one of our listeners will correct us. I believe that was the largest ever. dollar amount for a pre-phase three company. This week, we mentioned J&J, Halda, and thanks to Tess for fact checking at $3 billion is the biggest ever phase one transaction. And I believe just a couple months ago, the AbbVie capstan deal— at about $2 billion evaluation— was the largest ever preclinical transaction. So we've been setting some records in biotech M&A left and right for the past few months. Tess, you mentioned that these deals may be more competitive because The FTC has been playing nice in the sandbox.\n\n00:17:34,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n And maybe also competition is getting more competition in terms of getting pharma up off of its seat and into the game. But I'm curious as to the broader team's thoughts here. You know, what's going on, what might be. Truly creating this wave and what pharma might be looking for next. Jeroen, do you have any thoughts?\n\n00:17:56,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I mean, the one thing that immediately jumps up is, you know, the cost, the price of drugs has gone up a lot, right? So back in the days, Eric, in 2009, no one thought Zyteco was going to be that big. Um now, as you said, Mark is putting 5 billion for flu vaccine, it flew. Uh, profi— you know, type drug. So I think that the cost of drugs is probably one of the drivers.\n\n00:18:26,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thank you. I just point to another, you know, another driver that is, you know, really the.\n\n00:18:34,790 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think a lot of companies have actually sorted through the kind of 2026 or, it's at least like priced in, right? Like, the Hey, what's going to happen in 2026, 2027, in terms of. uh, you know, patent portfolio, patent cliff, and have a bit of like a longer view, um, about what they want to build to be competitive without having this like, oh my gosh, like can we just solve like next year or like two years from now. Um, which was really kind of the tone. Like, if you were, if you recall, um, you know, a couple of years ago, it was kind of like, are you not going to get bod unless you have a phase three. and are fulfilling an immediate need. And I think that is a really positive development, because it creates space for some of these. more strategic kind of platform transactions and more strategic. like portfolio and franchise. you know, deals that maybe. uh you know maybe longer term and that's really helpful and important for biotech because it means that like there's an understanding that.\n\n00:19:39,360 [SPEAKER_2]\n strategic could jump in at an earlier stage, right? They're not going to have to You're not going to have to wait and necessarily commercialize everything yourself. And I think that combined with the fact that. actually. the past year or two years have seen several biotechs come out and like commercialize. exceptionally well themselves. Like, that is also a very helpful fact pattern to point to.\n\n00:20:04,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'll just add also that, and I don't, so the clarity that we've got now from the administration, I think, has been very helpful. The lack of worry about FTC issues, unless you're Novo trying to buy Metzera against Pfizer, is another element. But I would say, because we keep thinking that it's all about LOEs.\n\n00:20:27,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Novartis, for instance, did this deal, which of course was in the sweet spot of what they're looking for with Avidity.","char_start":14986,"char_end":19395,"start_time":"00:16:16","end_time":null}

Our patent team at Bloomberg Intelligence has just done an analysis that suggests that Cosentix can be um quite i'm not going to say easily, but can be protected for way beyond this molecule patent expiry, which reminds me of the human. So I don't know how much of it is driven by that necessarily anymore. Every time I look at these LOEs, and they're also looking at Keytruda. I'm not quite sure what will happen there and what the outcome will be. But it would be interesting if none of these drugs, big drugs for these companies, end up actually going off patent. In the days that we're looking for, and then these acquisitions will be quite significant in terms of the accretion they give the companies on top of what didn't expire. So we'll wait and see.\n\n00:21:22,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n Interesting point. What about the role that M &A is playing in terms of promulgating this biotech rally? It seems like we're almost growing accustomed to waking up on a Monday morning and having a nice splashy deal on the table. I wonder, are we getting too addicted to M &A? What might happen when this M &A trade starts to deteriorate. Of course we are biotech analysts, so we like to take a glass half empty view of things. Anyone have thoughts as to whether the industry is dependent upon M &A at this stage for the rally to continue?\n\n00:21:59,490 [SPEAKER_0]\n I maybe I'll let me chime in. I personally don't think so because I think the valuations are coming off the trough. Valuations and Look, large cap, as we know, is a tale of two cities. They're the ones that are looking really good and they're trading based on growth. In the mid-cap, there's always going to be concentration.\n\n00:22:20,530 [SPEAKER_0]\n Toward M&A names.\n\n00:22:22,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n But people, I think, are willing to pay up for good growth, good prospects, good probability of success. Small cap is in a recovery mode. Valuations have gone up, but valuations are still not bad at all. I mean, we're looking at. We have names all, right? Eric, chime in as well, you know, up 4x or whatever it is, up 3x, but they're making it up. They're trading at a billion market cap now with $400 million in cash. They were trading sub-cash before. And we think they're going to have $1 billion to $2 billion product. And if you do proverbial four multiple, it should be a $4 billion to $8 billion company trading now at $1 billion, admittedly up fourfold. But he was so distressed previously, so. I would say valuations still are, you know, still early sort of in recovery.\n\n00:23:07,260 [SPEAKER_3]\n I actually agree with you, Rowan, and I like the point that Tess made, that many biotech companies are not dependent upon M &A because they're showing that they can launch these drugs themselves.\n\n00:23:18,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n And have good success in doing so in a relatively quick ramp to profitability.\n\n00:23:22,909 [SPEAKER_3]\n Of course, you're on the point you made earlier that drug pricing is much higher than it ever was, is facilitating those launches and that ramp toward profitability. And in some ways, you could argue the converse of what I just suggested, which is that M &A is bad for the sector and losing Sonora. In losing HALDA, in losing Avidity, we may be, in the future, depriving ourselves of some wonderful mid-cap success stories that we only strengthen. The quality of the companies that we have to follow and strengthen the components of the biotech index. And be viewed as strengthening our sector for the long term. I know that at least that's my partner Josh Schumer's views on occasion. So let's wrap up our M &A discussion and move to. a little bit more. of a discussion around Washington policy. Sam, you picked up on some very interesting changes to the CDC website with regard to vaccine safety, unfortunately. This issue was in the news more broadly this week as well.\n\n00:24:25,430 [SPEAKER_3]\n But why don't you start us off?\n\n00:24:27,630 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, I think, Eric, this also ties into our conversation later if we do get to it about Moderna and their guidance and forecasts and hopes.","char_start":19095,"char_end":23570,"start_time":"00:20:27","end_time":null}

Well, maybe we all did think it would happen, but it wasn't supposed to because Secretary Kennedy's deposition or comments at the Senate hearings that he had before being.\n\n00:24:53,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n given the final approval to be the HHS secretary.\n\n00:24:58,580 [SPEAKER_1]\n said that um that we're not going to do anything to undermine vaccines etc and and here we have the cdc page vaccine safety i'm looking at it saying autism vaccines, 19th of November, the claim vaccines do not cause autism is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.\n\n00:25:21,530 [SPEAKER_1]\n Okay, so we've got at least 16 well-controlled population-based studies that show that there is no clear association. between and no associate i'm not going to even leave it at clear no association between vaccinations, particularly MMR, which is the one that everybody keeps going on about, and autism, and even timerosol, which was something that they discussed, not necessarily linked. So what I don't know is the CDC expecting here. Are they going to suggest? Somebody, which is who. needs to do a prospectively designed clinical trial that takes a group of newborns and gives them no vaccines.\n\n00:26:07,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n and a group of newborns, and gives them whatever vaccines, and then looks to see what happens over the next five years to the risk of developing autism.\n\n00:26:17,610 [SPEAKER_1]\n Is that the proposal? And if that is the proposal, who's going to do it? Who's going to fund it? How ethical is it?\n\n00:26:25,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n pediatrician would would agree to do that. How do they enroll these subjects, etc.\n\n00:26:31,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um and so that becomes a major issue. And you can't I don't really know where to take this beyond what I've just said. What I do know is that the more this happens, the more you're going to get that negativity around vaccines. And I think even even. Um clear-minded folk are becoming a little bit worried. Thinking or maybe there is a link— maybe I should worry a little bit here. And of course, all that does is that it increases hesitancy towards vaccines. So, not a good step forward again. And I want to repeat, this is not a US issue. This is everywhere. How is it that— In Canada, we have such a massive um rise in measles this year that it they lost their Um, WHO designation as having got rid of measles. So, and that's, you know, they don't have a Secretary Kennedy there or a CDC with a website like this. So this is this is a problem everywhere.\n\n00:27:32,270 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think I think it's a something that's not us specific at all.\n\n00:27:37,690 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well.\n\n00:27:39,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n Great point, Sam.\n\n00:27:41,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Just a great point on having to prove the negative in order to maybe satisfy the Maha critics around vaccine safety and this link to autism. It's impossible to do. You could create any conspiracy theory and put it out there and say, 'Well, prove me wrong.' And of course, a lot of wasted resources would be spent doing so. But the answer probably is it's an obvious one. The other thing about this CDC web pages is I think you mentioned this to me in an email. This is exactly what RFK Jr. had promised Senator Bill Cassidy that he would not do during his confirmation hearings. I think this was very explicit. As part of his confirmation process that he would not remove the CDC statement on vaccines and autism, so that web page that you're looking at. It does still say, 'I believe that vaccines are not associated with autism.' Those words are there, but they're now uh— i think have an asterisk next to them that says that this claim is not evidence-based. There's a lot of wordsmithing going on, playing with, I'd say, semantics.\n\n00:28:43,950 [SPEAKER_2]\n The footnote, Eric, it says the header, 'vaccines do not cause autism,' has been removed due to agreement with the chair of.\n\n00:28:55,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n Help, so Cassidy, so it's it's uh yeah, it's just it's just incredible.

The um, yes, yes, absolutely.\n\n00:29:04,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, you would think that the movement would lose some credibility by going through that type of a tactic. But we'll see how long this lasts and what Senator Cassidy's response might be. I don't know. More vaccine, non-science. There was an article in Scientific American this week just calling out some comments that RFK Jr. made earlier in the week on peanut allergies, apparently. He's now throwing out the rise in peanut allergy prevalence. Uh, to potentially some tie to vaccines and a little bit on this, despite uh any uh indication of a scientific link, so I guess in RFK's world, any any type of increased incidence of disease could be associated with the vaccine usage. And again, you need to prove the negative. I found the article in the Wall Street Journal last weekend to be quite interesting as well. I don't know if you all read that. It did report on some increased tension between RFK and Dr. Macari.\n\n00:30:07,220 [SPEAKER_3]\n And some of that was stylistic about, you know, how Dr. McCurry might be running the FDA. But I think a little bit also was potentially oriented around their different philosophies around drug development.\n\n00:30:23,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n I don't know, Tess, I know you and. Great people at No Patient Left Behind certainly believe. Adamantly that a stronger FDA is critical to the success of our industry. The No Patient Left Behind group is done a wonderful public service for all of us in biotech by trying to I'd say harness the people within our industry and fight for that strong FDA. Maybe you just want to recap your latest initiative, but also Um, Where are you in thinking that we can have a scientifically driven, whether it's CDC or FDA or any set of government agencies under this. HHS Secretary, well, RFK Jr.\n\n00:31:11,130 [SPEAKER_2]\n yeah um i mean maybe to the second question first uh low confidence until we see something different um So I think we'll have to, what's interesting is to kind of. I guess, contrast the decisions that we've seen with the non-vaccine side, right? So let's separate out kind of vaccines and everything else. And on vaccines, I think we're seeing a lot that is really not scientifically driven. For everything else. When we look at the actual decisions that have been made. Look, there've been some. More borderline decisions that you could argue either way. But there isn't any drug that we've seen where it's like, 'Oh, it's like a total home run.' This should obviously be approved. And it, like, hasn't right. It's more of these cases where, like. There is debate. Um, So. That is kind of interesting from a decision standpoint. But I think going beyond that and just hearing what companies are going through—and, like we've heard some of this publicly, where Unicure was like, 'We have alignment.'\n\n00:32:16,490 [SPEAKER_2]\n And then it's like, 'Oh wait, actually, the FDA said something different.' And that is what really comes out in the FDA survey that we did. We did an FDA survey of companies in April. We did another survey. More recently. And I think the April survey was interesting where we were seeing a little bit of like, you know, hey, there were some companies that were having challenges getting the right people. And there were a lot of like doge impacts that the FDA was still working through. Um, But, you know, overall I'd say there were also several companies that were really impressed with, wow, like the FDA has actually continued to provide us with, like, really important advice. As we move forward in our clinical development path. But in this November survey, it was like. Oh my goodness, like 82% of respondents said they were worried about the FDA's ability to function. And some of the examples and case studies that we heard about were really challenging. We're like, Companies had requested meetings and they couldn't get meetings.

Um and this is a real challenge, like you know, and it makes me worried for when we're actually going to see this play out, because you know, this can affect a company that is going and doing their phase two right, and they thought their VCU design was okay. And maybe they couldn't get exactly the feedback that they were looking for from the FDA. And so they had to kind of like. Take a chance and go forward with something. Um, but how is that going to impact them down the road when they have to come back and like talk about their registrational trial and inform, like you know what the what the trial design should look like— so these are real challenges, this uncertainty and like lack of uh you know challenges getting\n\n00:34:17,710 [SPEAKER_2]\n quality feedback. I think that's a real issue and confusion about what counts and where the bar is. Um is really a challenge for companies at every stage and it can hamper um you know the development path for any drug that is not like incredibly straightforward and has a lot of precedent for what the clinical trial design should look like.\n\n00:34:40,020 [SPEAKER_3]\n Wonderful insights. Thanks for sharing that survey result. Jeroen, your thoughts on whether a scientific organization like the FDA can uh can operate and and thrive under an RFK junior led HHS and if not, what what do you think is going to give next.\n\n00:34:57,370 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I can contribute a lot that hasn't been said. We're seeing the assault on science in a scientific way, in a traditional way. Um. You know I think that What's even more surprising about the Wall Street Journal article was, I believe it was an Endpoint or a Stat article talking about how tight JFK Jr. and Trump are. R. and, of course, most of us didn't expect that. Uh, we people were ship. Actually, proven to be incorrect. So that is concerning. And what's also becoming pretty evident is this is not just coming from RFK Jr., it's also coming from the president directly.\n\n00:35:43,890 [SPEAKER_0]\n So this is going to have legs, and this is going to have long-term consequences, which are concerning.\n\n00:35:51,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I think it's also tied to certain degrees to know the overall administration to a certain degree and what's going to be the outlook of who is going to be the next administration and what their view is going to be, because this is going to have decades worth of connotations. So things are getting done in the meantime. Are getting a little bit harder to call what's probably more concerning is the early programs that are not getting reviewed and the the implication long term because when you have delays there that's not going to be a crl with six months it could be two or three year delays. So this is going to be a new dawn for us. We all remember the times when FDA was not so functional, and that did have connotations on the sector. Again, I think the good news perhaps is that we're coming off trough valuations, um. And so some of that is probably incorporated to a certain degree, but this is going to be something that we're going to have to sort through with time.\n\n00:36:47,300 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, anything you wanted on this topic?

The only thing I'm worried about is a stat article from Adam saying, Rick Pasnoor fighting with Vinay Prasad. Because remember, Dr. Prasad still has the chief scientific officer. Title: I think, unless that's changed too, but we still we have this issue. Now that you have an A, A, I think Rick Pastor is not somebody who you can just steamroll over. So and I think he's— I'm gonna assume that I am right in that he has a very very clean background. None of the issues that eventually ended up causing a problem for Tidmarsh, etc. So That's the one thing I'm worried about, the Adam article or one of his colleagues on a Tuesday or Wednesday saying, 'Oh, there's a massive rift here.'\n\n00:37:58,005 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, hopefully we'll cross our fingers and um, cooler heads will be prevailing at the FDA, including for the benefit of science. Let's turn our discussion to a couple of news items from the week on drug pricing and your own. You noted the Arrowhead approval for FCS and the substantially lower price point at which they're going to be introducing their drug relative to Iona, Sam. I know you've been following the GLIP one. pricing wars.\n\n00:38:29,120 [SPEAKER_3]\n Maybe Yaron, just start off with a quick recap of what happened over at Arrowhead and why they chose to do what they did.\n\n00:38:36,430 [SPEAKER_0]\n Absolutely. Actually, maybe I'll go on a very quick point here because that's relevant and maybe put my own kind of earlier comment into perspective. So we just hosted a call yesterday with a Harvard professor who's done an analysis. Drug costs overall, branded drug costs. In the last 10 years or so, and I think the analysis this is you guys tools for yourself.\n\n00:39:01,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n The gross prices went up 11. 9%. The actual net prices went up 1. 9%. So it's one thing— it's important to keep in mind, you know, overall, net pricing is not going up so quickly. But let's talk about Arrowhead versus Ionis here. And this is really interesting. So recall, these are both AP3 drugs.\n\n00:39:26,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n They are both looking really, really good. The one from Ionis is an ASO. It's injected every month. And the one from Arrowhead is an He's on siRNA. It's injected every three months. And Ionis is the head. So Ionis got approval in FCS, in familial cholera microneumia syndrome. Patients who have a genetic abnormality, they have high triglycerides or fats in their blood, and it can cause acute pancreatitis. This is an ultra, ultra orphan indication, about 1,000 patients in the U. S., and they priced it at $595,000 for an ASO. In the meantime, they just read out the data for severe high triglycerides, which is the same. It's just not genetically confirmed. That's a much bigger price. So they're talking that they think the price will go down from 595, because it's the same drug and the same dosing, to let's say 10,000 to 20,000, perhaps 15,000 to 20,000.\n\n00:40:20,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n In the meantime, your signal keeps deteriorating.\n\n00:40:25,300 [SPEAKER_0]\n Oh boy.\n\n00:40:27,500 [SPEAKER_0]\n Can you hear me? So why don't you go ahead, Sam?\n\n00:40:29,560 [SPEAKER_3]\n We can hear you well enough, Jeroen. I'd continue.\n\n00:40:40,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n Girona, are you there?\n\n00:40:44,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n We can't hear you.\n\n00:40:47,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, do you want to follow up on Arrowhead Ionis or were you like me too? Or where do you want to go?\n\n00:40:53,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n I'm suffering. I'm not hearing you very well either. I wonder if it's a system problem. So can you guys hear me?\n\n00:40:59,430 [SPEAKER_2]\n I hear you fine and I hear Eric fine. It was just your own, for me as well.\n\n00:41:04,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Okay, well, I'll keep going and then I'll see if I can switch my feed. So we had Novo, obviously, as Eric, you put it.\n\n00:41:14,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n dropping their price again for semaglutide or Wegovy. Now starting doses of $200 per month, starting doses of $200 per month through the first quarter. After which it goes up to $350 per month on average. Versus $500 a month previously, similar to GLP-1. This is similar to the GLP-1 pricing out of Trump RX.","char_start":35046,"char_end":39527,"start_time":"00:36:47","end_time":null}

This is similar to the GLP-1 pricing out of Trump RX.\n\n00:41:41,180 [SPEAKER_1]\n What's interesting is that I suppose you could read this, and this is the only way I think I can read this, as trying to compete for new patient starts as we go into the back end of the year and in what's clearly a price-sensitive market.\n\n00:41:56,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n And Nova is playing catch up in this space. And this was clear. I mean, if you listen to their third quarter results.\n\n00:42:03,920 [SPEAKER_1]\n Um. which were night and day compared to Lily. And of course, we've known all along that lily-zep bound, so trisepatide, does have a arguably a better weight loss profile. I mean, I think they've shown that in a head-to-head trial. So and also sleep apnea indication. So, um, we could maybe also now see that lily is going to do the same thing and bring down the price. So or at least to try and compete this out. Or maybe they just sit back and wait for their um. I believe that their profile is sufficiently strong that would withstand this. I just want to highlight that the multi-dose pen is going to be available at the lowest price around $299. So that's a pretty significant, hefty discount that Nova is offering, at least in the short term.\n\n00:42:56,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n Now, there's obviously you've got] the Medicare and Medicaid action coming in and the $350 price for Wegovia, Z-Bound, and/ or for Glipron.\n\n00:43:07,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n From TrumpRx. And the oral GLP-1s are now on a starting dose of $150 per month. And yet nobody is changing their mind. Models with regards to the massive potential for this market, because everybody believes, and we concur with that, that the lower the prices come, the more likely you're going to get volume compensating for it.\n\n00:43:30,730 [SPEAKER_3]\n Over.\n\n00:43:32,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n So I think the point that Yaron was probably likely to make, and Yaron, I don't know. You're back. Go ahead. If you can hear me.\n\n00:43:38,600 [SPEAKER_0]\n If you can hear. Yeah. So Eric, chime in. So I don't know where I left off, but the price from Ionis will go down. From $5. 95 for the ultra orphan indication, genetically based, to the same drug, same dose, obviously in a much bigger market. They're going to file and get approved late next year. That price is going to go from $5. 95, they're saying, to let's say $15 to $20. And most of us are thinking it would be incrementally more. Well, Arrowhead is behind. So what they did, and because they're behind, they're running slightly different studies. So they just got approved for the ultra orphan indication. And of course, the eye on the prize is the bigger indication, the SHTG. Where they're not going to have, Arrowhead's not going to have their data until, let's say, Q3 or so next year. And because they were behind, they ran slightly different studies, which are geared to inevitably looking at higher risk patients. So keeping an eye on the price, they're already pricing it now for the high risk population only of the bigger market.\n\n00:44:39,210 [SPEAKER_0]\n So they ended up pricing it at $60,000, or a 90% discount to the Ionis price currently. Again, so they're pricing it at $60. And Ionis is talking about pricing, ultimately, for the big indication, let's say, 15 to 20. So an interesting situation. And people are now asking, so what does this mean? Does that mean that Ionis now has a 'quote unquote' license to price it higher? Up to 60. On our calls with management, publicly, they're saying that they think people are asking about the risdifra price from madrigal, which is around 50,000, and management saying that's too high because they're not thinking it's just going to get used in high risk. It's going to go very broadly. So they're continuing to index toward 15 to 20. So it looks like, at the end, the bottom line, they'll have similar potentially labels, Coke and Pepsi, slight differences, but they're probably going to contract. very differently with pairs. And maybe Arrowhead, because of their studies, is going to contract for the higher risk big market. Whereas Ionis, because their studies were broader and they have data on everybody, will inevitably contract much more broadly.","char_start":39227,"char_end":43678,"start_time":"00:41:41","end_time":null}

So I don't know if it's going to be 25. That's always in the model or maybe 30 and maybe eventually Arrowhead discounts a little bit. And that's kind of where equilibrium is going to end up. But it's going to be— it's these are great drugs and it should be really be a big market.\n\n00:45:59,669 [SPEAKER_0]\n As a firm, we like both stocks a lot.\n\n00:46:02,920 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, it's such a fascinating scenario analysis that's playing out here with two pretty similar drugs that will have fairly similar labels, at least, but maybe, you know, different pricing and a different strategy for going after, as you say, your own. The severe end of the market versus maybe the more common and generic form of hyperlipid. We'll see. But I guess the broader theme here is that drug pricing is coming down, not up. Historically, we used to say that the drug prices only move in one direction, that they were up. We rarely, if ever, saw companies cut the price of their drug on us. Net or uh wholesale adjusted basis— so don't know— are we seeing a change here or are these therapeutic categories becoming so dense and competitive.\n\n00:46:51,769 [SPEAKER_3]\n That we might see more of this sort of thing. Tess, do you have any views?\n\n00:46:56,470 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think a lot of it comes down to like, what are the incentives for PBMs and for coverage? And if we start seeing more companies come out—uh, like, like Signa was doing, saying, 'Hey, like, we're going to take a new approach to rebate.'\n\n00:47:12,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n And Cigna talked about eliminating prescription drug rebates for some private health plans starting in 2027. So this is going to be a a gradual thing. It's not all in one shot. But I think you take out, you know, you get rid of rebates, you take away one of the top reasons for pricing high, which is. Leaving room to rebate, knowing that those rebates are only going to go in one direction, which is up. After the drug is launched.\n\n00:47:37,440 [SPEAKER_2]\n I think it's great to see competition in categories where Look, when you have something that is just so clearly best in class, I think there's recognition that it's worth it to pay for that premium, depending on how much.\n\n00:47:51,999 [SPEAKER_2]\n But, you know, this is why having some, you know, similar drug competition can actually be really helpful. You know, it brings us back. We were talking. I think a few weeks back, about like, you know, me too drugs and like our me too drugs. Like, useful? And do they have merit? And, like, yes, they have merit, because you know, they can actually help bring down price and you know, inform another important part of competition.\n\n00:48:20,710 [SPEAKER_3]\n Sam, your own, any other broader thoughts on the topic of drug pricing?\n\n00:48:27,250 [SPEAKER_3]\n Okay.\n\n00:48:27,660 [SPEAKER_0]\n No, no.\n\n00:48:29,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n The only thing to Tessa's point that I would say is we do follow growth to net and we have a database that we do. and the average price to net discount right now, in part D, like dog, um, is in the 30s and in price B, like boys, around high 40s. So as you said, the list price is not the real price.\n\n00:48:53,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n And what's interesting, I think, about drug pricing in general is not that the list prices aren't going up by a dramatic level. I think you're right. You're on your analysis. I'm sure it's spot on. We haven't seen huge growth in list pricing. We've certainly seen limited growth in net pricing. But what we have seen is new products coming in at premiums higher than what we've ever seen. If you, if you try and factor that into the drug pricing discussion, um, maybe you know, on a net patient basis or average patient basis, the prices are probably going up.","char_start":43378,"char_end":47511,"start_time":"00:45:42","end_time":null}

And that has to do with Agios, which had very mixed data, I would say. Sickle cell disease from their drug Mitopiveta PKR activator earlier in the week. Tess, did you want to give us the background on this one?\n\n00:49:47,290 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, absolutely. So just backing up and sharing some context in sickle cell, I mean, area of huge unmet need, really, really challenging disease. And I think we all remember Oxbrita, which was a drug-approved global blood therapeutics drug. And, essentially, what they saw is, they didn't hit on VOC, which are the actual kind of vascular occlusion crises that these patients, you know, have. But they did hit on hemoglobin, right?\n\n00:50:22,920 [SPEAKER_2]\n The drug was approved. And if you recall, Pfizer bought the company. And then they read out the confirmatory study that was looking at VOCs. That had been a post-marketing commitment for the company. And those, they did not hit on VOCs. And I think this was a real upset for the community because the drug was also pulled very quickly without really a lot of support for the patient community, or at least it was perceived that way by many in the patient community. And so I think everyone was hoping that midipuvat would be different and that there would be a VOC benefit in addition to hemoglobin. And what they reported is that there was not a hit on VOC. There was a trend, including when you looked at the hemoglobin responders. And they will go back to the FDA and do a pre. um you know snda meeting since the the drug is currently approved is currently approved for beta And they'll talk about the data package and talk about that just in the context of.\n\n00:51:33,840 [SPEAKER_2]\n sickle cell being an area that is incredibly high. incredibly high and met need. So that is going to be a really. A really challenging, really challenging decision for. Uh, you know, for the FDA, um, and uh, you know, we will await we'll await commentary after they have had that meeting with them.\n\n00:51:55,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Jeroen, you mentioned some inconsistencies and difficulties that investors were having, kind of handicapping some of these rare orphan approvals, maybe in part based on. changing FDA landscape. I mean, in this case, it is going to be a tough decision. A heart goes out to the sickle cell community. They're in dire need of new therapies. The standard of care for these patients is still extremely poor. I think the life expectancy. Of a sickle cell patient in the United States is still hovering around.\n\n00:52:24,580 [SPEAKER_3]\n 40 or so years, and there are a lot of these patients. Yes, it's a rare disease, but there are an estimated 100, 000 or so such patients in the United States. And they have very little in terms of innovation. So. In terms of the Medipivac study that you very kindly. Uh, summarized tests. Yeah, it hit on one of two primary endpoints. And It's going to be hard to I think. Squint and see. In terms of actual data and analysis, any true clinical benefit this drug brings, but but Agios at least is indicating that they're. They're going to send this down to the FDA and hope for the best. I guess again, this may bring up the broader question of whether anyone really knows where the FDA is going to set the bar in rare disease.\n\n00:53:14,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Um, you know, the leadership, the HGC, has been been saying for some time we want to move toward the side of right to try and give patients access to drugs and and do things very quickly. But, do we know where the bar is set? Uh, Sam, do you want to chime in on what you think should be doing differently so that maybe the drug developers have a little bit more understanding of what to do.\n\n00:53:39,170 [SPEAKER_1]\n What you mean from a regulatory perspective?\n\n00:53:42,410 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah.

But again, we have a situation where— where is this going? Is this CBER or CEDAR? It's CEDAR, right?\n\n00:54:05,380 [SPEAKER_3]\n This one will be Cedar.\n\n00:54:06,340 [SPEAKER_1]\n So maybe the new boss of Cedar. who has done a great job for oncology. He's going to be applying his level-headed thinking to to take care of these things. I mean, you know. This is a difficult one, I have to admit. I mean, you know, Tess did a great job, so.\n\n00:54:27,050 [SPEAKER_1]\n Maybe we can be a bit more optimistic here.\n\n00:54:32,070 [SPEAKER_3]\n Your own, anything you want to throw in?\n\n00:54:36,040 [SPEAKER_0]\n Um, not, not on this one.\n\n00:54:39,060 [SPEAKER_0]\n I think you have another topic later on, which is actually super interesting. Yeah, we don't have it later on, Jeroen.\n\n00:54:43,660 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, why don't we, okay, you guys, I know, go ahead, you start on what you want to talk about, Jeroen.\n\n00:54:51,080 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, I mean, the things we're seeing— so that I want to talk about maybe Zion Works and then very quickly on Aftis and the whole concept of, you know, biotech companies and how they're beginning to return cash to shareholders a little bit and the transition to royalty models as well and maybe monetizing things in a different way. So ZymeWorks, I just read out with Jazz and B1, their Horizon GEA frontline study. This is a HERA, it's a HER2 by Specific. And he went head-to-head against Herceptin. So that's two arms, and the third arm was plus or minus a PD-1 from B1 to Vimbra. Obviously, chemo background. And it looks like the data is going to be very, very strong, which is what one should have anticipated based on the previous data. We think we're going to see the data at ASCO GI. They're saying it's going to be early next year. It's the most likely meeting. And it looks like it's going to be really, really good data. And then, so Jazz went up, Zyme went up. And Denzyme, a day or two later, came out and said that they're going to shift their business model a little bit.\n\n00:55:58,240 [SPEAKER_0]\n The business model was really twofold. One, they have their internal ADC portfolio. They'll continue to work on that. But they're increasingly going to move now to do a royalty-based business model. And even for their own pipeline, they're going to be looking to partner it. They're trying to diversify risk and they're going to now monetize a lot of future milestones and royalties on Zahira to then go out and be very flexible as to potentially in licensed compounds, developing them and partnering them maybe by company. Companies or a platform that are undervalued and then monetize it via royalties. Even being willing to go out and buy royalties, which are undervalued, and monetize them. And they announced a $125 million buyback. And Anaptis, of course, recently also announced that they're going to be suit[ing] the company. They do have a common shareholder, as well, obviously, both of them. And the concept is really to move away from the traditional risk-heavy single sort of program business model.\n\n00:57:02,010 [SPEAKER_0]\n More of a diversified model. And so that's definitely something we're beginning to see. And the concept is not just to go into businesses and kind of break them up, which is obviously there's one well-known fund that's trying to do that, but rather to now risk, mitigate, and diversify a little bit. Slightly different model. Curious to see what everybody thinks about it.\n\n00:57:23,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, thank you for bringing up that model. It's definitely different and certainly seems much more shareholder friendly in terms of redeployment of capital.

So your choice, you can wrap it up.\n\n00:57:36,350 [SPEAKER_1]\n Two two minutes very quickly. Um, just to add to your own, we're also very excited for the data that's very likely, as he said, was going to come in. asco gr. So we like the asset and we like the setup for that particular trial. New Valent had some data, pretty good data. It took us a little while to get our head around the different subgroups, et cetera. But this is a third generation ALK inhibitor. Enterprise value is now about $7 billion. On the back of the data, they raised 500 million. And we think we have a proprietary, we have a lot of proprietary cancer models, our ALK model. gives them a very meaningful share, pretty much most of second line, but certainly in first line also in ALK inhibitors. We've got a drug that's got potentially similar efficacy to Pfizer's, what I would call its best in class, lorlatinib. But of course, we need to see more longer-term duration of response, etc. And it's got AEs that are similar more to.\n\n00:58:38,940 [SPEAKER_1]\n um electinib, which is Russia's drug, so it's an interesting space. um I mean, I don't want to wake up in one day and find someone's had a heist law liver tox because the liver tox is a little bit higher than what we see with the lectinib, but it's early days and we're positive on this. um on this asset and this drug, and possibly an MNA target. And then, because of the fact that pharma seems to be buying, I don't, sorry, just be careful with that. Pharma seems to be buying these kinds of assets and these kinds of companies. So I'm not saying that I know anything. I don't want to get myself into hot water. And then the next one is Olema, which share price went up and they raised some money on the back of data from Roche, which showed that the oral cert that they're developing, Roche's Giro d'Estre, actually worked in a first-line trial. And it is in wild type patients, ESR1 wild type patients, which is where people were worried after as well that it wouldn't work.\n\n00:59:39,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n So we've ended up in a situation where Olema has got one of the better assets here. Is it the best asset in the class? In the approach, I'm not sure, but it is a very viable product. And I think that share price move suggests that investors think that too. So we're looking for data in 2027 potentially, whereas AstraZeneca and Roche will have data in 2026.\n\n01:00:06,429 [SPEAKER_1]\n And there was a lot more to say, but I'm going to leave it at that.","char_start":55194,"char_end":57955,"start_time":"00:57:36","end_time":null}

You know, it's interesting, Josh, like I I read something, you know, sometimes this probably happens to me. I read something that someone posted on Twitter that was said by the Canter Biotech team, which I thought was actually a really good point, which was that. You know, the success of a lot of drug launches in the past year from small to mid-sized companies, as I think, like, sort of marks a different phase of where we are with biotech. versus 10 years ago, whereas a lot of the exciting stuff that's going on right now is not propped up on a dream, but certain drugs that look great in phase two and phase three are kind of becoming real. And we're seeing young companies like Insmed, Madrigal, like many just kind of be able to grow up. And so I feel like that piece is really, really healthy. I feel like the- drug pricing piece, from a threat perspective, continues to seem relatively minimal. I think there's going to be more M &A. So it feels like, if we just— kind of list off the factors that sort of drive strong biotech performance in the backdrop of an XBI that still is kind of nowhere near its sort of all-time highs when things were frothy.\n\n00:02:29,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, I feel. I feel relatively good. We'll talk about it more. It's hard not to be somewhat nervous about this FDA stuff as it relates to timelines and efficiency and also just predictability. But I think in general, for drugs where the data are fairly unequivocal and the endpoints are validated, I still feel like the FDA is going to be mostly fine. I mean, I'm, you know, like I'm the most worried about it in this kind of rare disease realm and I don't cover vaccines, but of course that that's its own animal. So, I mean, I think like in general, like. It's hard to make a call that the sector is going to be up 30%, 50%. But I guess I'm not worried about us entering into another bear market imminently. Curious what others think.\n\n00:03:12,100 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I'll just, I'm a huge baseball fan.\n\n00:03:17,990 [SPEAKER_0]\n And with that in mind, I try to think about analogies relative to baseball. And so I'm frequently asked, given the rally in biotech, where are we? And I'm curious what others might say, but I think it feels to me that we're like in the third inning of what this rally is looking like. Now, I will say that.\n\n00:03:40,960 [SPEAKER_0]\n I'm a bit uh concerned about how quickly uh the XBI and again we know that's an imperfect proxy for biotech but I I am a little concerned that it's gone up so far and so quickly I wish it'd be a little bit more gradual but you know every market is a new market we always look to the past obviously but you just never know Um But I do agree with you, Paul. I feel pretty good. And look, we've got JP Morgan coming up in San Francisco next month. I think the sentiment there is going to be incredibly positive and bullish. And obviously, the markets are dynamic. FDA is the FDA.","char_start":0,"char_end":4475,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Brian, how about you?\n\n00:04:27,380 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I would say I'm generally in the same camp, I think. Look, I mean, maybe to – Try to counter.\n\n00:04:35,979 [SPEAKER_2]\n Greg's argument about just how fast it's come. I mean, I mean, you could also say likewise, like how fast it went down. I mean, it took a while to write, like the COVID peak. I mean, we just saw. pretty tremendous drop from peak at XBI. Frankly, while a bunch of other things were working really, really, really well, right? So, I mean, we've all struggled sort of through this four years of just. horrific divergence between the XBI and the S&P. Right? So, I would argue. It's been an aggressive move since this summer. but you know depends on what chart you're looking at like if you're looking at a six month chart yeah xbi looks uh like it's in in just bubble territory but if you look at the five year it doesn't look that way at all and it still looks um you know relatively cheap on a performance basis now charts are charts right so you know they don't necessarily have views into the fundamentals but i guess i would argue again like whether you're using large caps whether you're using kind of historical acquisition premiums historical acquisition prices like we're not really in bubble territory right i think\n\n00:05:38,780 [SPEAKER_2]\n like the the large cap pharma sector is trading you know still on average of like 15 times. I mean, you have all sorts of sectors that are trading at a significant premium to that. And look, you know, I think it's, you know, I thought there's a really nice tweet that summarized it by Rod Wong earlier this week saying, you know, unfortunately, FDA is now the major remaining source of policy uncertainty.\n\n00:06:01,849 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tackling reshoring, MFN, tariffs, took a lot of creativity and I'd consider hard because there was no blueprint. So the FDA is kind of, you know, as Paul said, you know, a lot of the concerns have really kind of dissipated here. And the FDA is sort of the one remaining one, and you know, I'll make an argument later as we go through it that maybe even that—um, kind of creating more noise around than what it actually could have fundamentally meaningful—um, the one thing that I would say I would just keep note of because it's had such a big impact when it starts changing is just interest rates. Right. I mean, I think we're still in this dynamic of fighting whether or not inflation and totally total control—um, and the economy is slowing down. And interest rates should continue coming down. Are we going to see a point where people worry about interest rates? Because the XBI is very, very much tied to. Uh, federal interest rates just because of the long investment cycle, so I'll stop with that.\n\n00:07:01,550 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, it feels like a very different industry than we've seen in the past. I think the biggest divider between the old biotech and the new biotech is the idea that you can actually be long product launches. There's almost no bigger red flag of an industry when stocks can't perform when they go from that hope and dream phase into the execution launch phase. So you know, not perhaps surprising that the sector struggled for a while up until it kind of figured out the The algorithm for successful product launches. Of course, one component to that is premium prices, which may be a topic we come back to at another point, either today or another week.","char_start":4177,"char_end":8034,"start_time":"00:04:19","end_time":null}

Whether as we enter 26 and anticipate a wave of IPOs, whether that wave of IPOs might impair the biotech rally by adding perhaps more speculative names and diluting the quality of the industry as perhaps we've seen in some of those prior very speculative years. We'd love to hear. Everyone's thoughts about, you know, the setup for IPOs in 26, how you're feeling about private companies, their prospects, and, you know, are they? Do they put the broader sector at risk by being overly speculative?\n\n00:08:32,570 [SPEAKER_1]\n Maybe I can chime in to start, Josh, because I know from your email, right, you have a view that there's a backlog of high quality companies out there. And from my seat, right, like I've launched on three IPOs this year, I think, Siona, MapLite, and LB Pharma. And so not to say that these three are emblematic for all IPOs in the future or private companies broadly, but all of them are mid-stage to like late-stage companies, right? And I remember back to 2020 when companies were putting in an S1 that their IPO catalyst was getting an IND accepted, right? So I still feel like, when I look at the private companies that we are vetting and could be companies that go public, couple years it still feels like we're a really long way away from that and that companies that are thinking of going public are not taking it lightly at all. It's not kind of like a like a Yolo, let's go public because we can, kind of thing. It's like, are we ready to be a public company?\n\n00:09:35,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n Are we ready to have events that can be value creating in the public markets? Does it make sense for us to be public? Because if we're public and our data is good, we can raise more money because public investors will value this type of data. So, I mean, you never say never, right? Things can get out of hand if you have a handful of IPOs that go well, and then people start looking at IPOs less as kind of an emerging company investment and more as just like the IPO product, right? The concept of an IPO that pops. But I don't think we're there at all. And I still feel like, because of how tough the IPO market has been, we've been in a world where there's been a lot of compelling private companies that have been able to mature and raise a lot of private capital.\n\n00:10:16,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n To go off, I want to hear what you have to say too. But I mean, the private investing world has changed a lot over the past 10 years as well, right? There's a lot of public investors now with deep pockets that do private investments, which I think has allowed private companies to sort of better incubate themselves. You know, be more than just one drug story. At least if I think about the first six to nine months of next year, and I think about just the company's high level—something that I think could go public— it feels like they're companies that are going to be institutionally relevant, not just sort of like illiquid publicly traded venture investments. If that makes sense, like, do you agree?\n\n00:10:49,490 [SPEAKER_3]\n How many IPOs do you think we see next year, Paul? What's your guess? I'm generally aligned with you.\n\n00:10:55,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n That's a good question.\n\n00:10:58,540 [SPEAKER_1]\n 15.\n\n00:10:59,860 [SPEAKER_3]\n What do you think? Over or under? I think the over-under is closer to 50. Greg, what are your thoughts? 50? There are so many high-quality private companies with really de-risked products and platforms, right? I mean, we've been accumulating them with a closed IPO. Maybe I'm insane. For three years, right— like I've never seen a crop of such mature de-risk companies that really deserve to be public when they're ready. And so, as long as the bull market continues into next year, we hit the peak with over 100 biotech IPOs a few years back. 50 is just half of that.\n\n00:11:39,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n I would say I would definitely take the over.\n\n00:11:42,390 [SPEAKER_1]\n I guess my number was stupid, but yeah, keep going.\n\n00:11:46,549 [SPEAKER_1]\n I feel dumb, yeah.","char_start":7734,"char_end":12230,"start_time":"00:07:45","end_time":null}

I talk to a lot of private companies. I think they're very hopeful. I would agree generally with the sentiments that we are seeing, at least at this stage, more mature, more de-risked companies that are.\n\n00:12:08,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, being teed up and I think deservedly so.\n\n00:12:12,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Is that over under 50? Maybe I'll be on the under of that 50 number, but I'm certainly hopeful that we get to. 40s and 50 and maybe even 60 if Josh is right. Um, what I do think that is different this time. And look that IPO. Um, period that we had from, let's say, you know, 20 to 22. Uh, was incredible. Right. We've all been around the business for a while. I mean, that was was just remarkable. And it got silly, quite honestly, in retrospect, right? I remember being at a prior shop, I think one day, like four. of my names launched on the same day in terms of the IPO. And I was there doing investor education and didn't know who wanted to talk about what. And I'd be, I had to remember like, oh yeah, this company, right? So that was like at the heyday. I don't. Or see that 2026 will be like that, where we were in that, just so many in any given week.\n\n00:13:17,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n But if we have a strong 2026, that could set a condition up for maybe a very, you know, healthy 2027. I think what we want is we— we just want sustained performance. Right. And I think that the crash that we saw from the XPI going, what was the peak, like 174? And look, we're only like 30% away from like that peak. But that was just such a massive crash. I think this time around, like I think companies, I think VCs, and I hope on some level bankers. The whole system will be a little bit more disciplined about how we go about things.\n\n00:13:59,100 [SPEAKER_2]\n Totally disagree. I think the system will absolutely start pushing out preclinical stuff.\n\n00:14:05,030 [SPEAKER_2]\n Eventually, probably not next year, 2027. It's happened every, I mean, it's just the cycle, right? I'm going to go with 23 IPOs next year. Josh, I'd love you to send me the list of 50 private quality companies that you think are going to come out.\n\n00:14:22,090 [SPEAKER_2]\n Paul, I totally agree with Paul's sentiment. I think what we're seeing in the IPOs that are getting out right now, and I hope it just that it stays this way, is you see development. age programs, making it to the public markets. I do not believe that at any point the public market has been able to sustainably sustainably analyze preclinical companies every five, 10 years when the cycle goes to peak. The public market tries to do that. I think it's total.\n\n00:14:52,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n And it's opportunistic financing, and it winds up being the signal of the crash. So, you know, I feel like we're in a safe place on the IPO side of things because I truly do think what is coming to market are mostly development stage assets, which the public market is constantly capable of evaluating and coming up with some reasonable valuation on it, even though we all will dispute those specific valuations.\n\n00:15:17,590 [SPEAKER_3]\n I guess the question is whether we lose discipline or not. I think so far things have been very disciplined, and that's been actually a a real tailwind for the industry. It's disciplined spending, importantly, disciplined capital allocation— perhaps forced upon the industry after years of being somewhat capital-starved.\n\n00:15:41,670 [SPEAKER_3]\n Companies are vaulting to profitability at paces we've never seen before. And once you're profitable, I mean, it's. Companies used to do everything they could to avoid being profitable up until like a few years ago.

That is kind of bizarre and baffling.\n\n00:15:57,150 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, now the companies are actually hitting profitability, sustaining that momentum, and starting to see the return to that in the industry more broadly. Um, all right, let's go to you know, probably everyone's favorite and least favorite topic to talk about—um, you know, Washington DC policy, the FDA, HHS. It's like groundhog day meets Twilight Zone. Brian, why don't you kick things off with some of the latest in terms of the leadership changes going on?\n\n00:16:27,690 [SPEAKER_2]\n So, look, I have said since the beginning of the year just to expect chaos at the FDA through HHS. I think direction is hard to pick here. I would argue that there are— just totally different conflicting views coming out of HHS and the agency. And it makes it very hard to predict a lot of things, right? I mean, and look, I mean. One thing that I would say is it's pretty easy to predict is that this HHS is going to be pushing back against vaccines. That has clearly been the case. I mean, we're just seeing a negative vote from ACIP on at-birth Hep B vaccination right now that's receiving criticism. But beyond that, like, is this a- flexible FDA? Is this like an FDA that's going to be extremely rigorous? It's really, really hard to tell because they sort of talk out of both sides of their mouths. And, you know, what we've really seen is a pretty substantial breakdown in terms of the institutional memory here.\n\n00:17:27,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n Little left of the old guard, at least on the on the senior leadership side, from the FDA and I'm not just talking about obviously, um, the FDA commissioners. That's an elected position, a, appointed position, um, uh, so more of a political position. But you know, people who were 20, 30 years. Employees of the FDA, uh, who rose into leadership roles, uh, almost one for every single one of them is, is, almost gone at this point. The most notable one just happened this week and, um, that is, um, Rick Pastor, who's been with the FDA way longer than I've been in this career. You know, we've all sort of followed him. He's been one of the most prolific voices in the FDA, running the Division of Oncology, taking over the Oncology Center of Excellence, a number of years ago. And, you know, we were very happy and I think all of us were really happy to see, after George Tidmarsh controversially left, the cedar possession after just a very brief stint.\n\n00:18:29,850 [SPEAKER_2]\n Pazder wound up taking over the cedar position. But I mean, basically three weeks later, he is. And, you know, I think there's numerous reports as to what sort of driving that decision could be. His counterpart, Martin Sieber, who is also the CSO of CMO Vinay Prasad, issuing some internal emails that have been very controversial. You know, if you believe media reports, he was sort of not being given leeway in terms of uh who to hire within Cedar, and you know, maybe he felt uh that whatever he was promised going into taking the job, you know, was not coming to fruition. So, you know, news of his resignation has hit in the last week.\n\n00:19:18,720 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, I think we all sort of felt like he was kind of the last adult in the room at the FDA.\n\n00:19:26,080 [SPEAKER_2]\n Tracy Beth Hoag has taken over as at least the interim Cedar director. She was sort of Marty Macari's chief advisor before that. And she's also had a— somewhat controversial— role in the FDA, going back to Dr. Prasad's email and some of the criticisms of the COVID vaccine and sort of these 10 childhood. Deaths due to the COVID vaccine that they're talking about. I mean, she was the person sort of credited with the analysis to come up with that. Um, so you know, it is definitely installing someone who is more along the lines of kind of this new maha rfk mentality than sort of the old guard. I think you know, pretty much across the board people are are concerned about the potential impact from pastor leaving and the state of the fda. Um, right now, but you know, in multiguna start with that and chat through what everyone kind of thinks the impact is going to be.\n\n00:20:26,959 [SPEAKER_3]\n Paul or Greg, any thoughts on that specifically?","char_start":15704,"char_end":20194,"start_time":"00:15:41","end_time":null}

I mean, gosh, Operation Warp Speed was one of, you know, not to delve into politics, but it was just probably one of the biggest achievements of the Trump administration. And, you know, there's a lot of hindsight stuff with COVID that people can argue about, but I just I just don't get it. But you know, other, outside of that, like, Like I said earlier, when we're talking about the sector outlook for next year, it still feels like, if you're an investor and you're looking at good science, you're looking at trials of well-understood endpoints, there's regulatory precedent for what's happening. You know, like the unmet need is significant. Like I think. I think 80 to 90% of the time, like you're probably fine, right? I mean, we're going to talk about, you know, Unicure, which feeds into kind of other stuff in gene therapy where companies are running single arm trials. And that's the hardest thing to predict, right? I mean, I just don't know how you reconcile.\n\n00:21:37,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n Some of this commentary about speeding up drug approvals and a plausible mechanism pathway, and then conversely, all the other kind of news that's been sort of confusing— with companies that thought they had alignment and then didn't. And so, I mean, but again, I think, from an investor perspective, I mean, I think you can.\n\n00:21:53,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n I don't want to be so cynical and kind of boil it down to stocks, but that's our job. I do think you can probably invest around this theme and generally be okay.\n\n00:22:03,840 [SPEAKER_1]\n Who's listening to this cares about what I think about public health. I'm not a public health expert. And, you know, we all have our own personal views. But yeah, I mean, like that piece of it is someone who's followed the industry for a long time. And it's kind of like venerated that the FDA.\n\n00:22:16,730 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, has sort of, like, I've never seen an FDA leader.\n\n00:22:21,130 [SPEAKER_1]\n Mention a president's name like in a memo, like I just don't like you know what I mean, like you see that and it's like kind of a bummer, right? Like Pasner was under a number of different republicans and democrats. And that, like, has never mattered. And to see that matter, I think, is kind of a bummer. But I think, from an investment perspective, like, it's I still think it's like probably going to be fine for the most part, outside of certain.\n\n00:22:42,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n cases that are more complicated.\n\n00:22:45,180 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, let's place hold the rare disease stuff in the Unicure. We'll come back to that in a second. Just kind of close out the vaccine discussion, Greg, on this one. Anything to add?\n\n00:22:56,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I mean, I think picture again—I'm not going to comment too much on like public health. I do think, though, it's important to remember that the FDA's job is to protect the, you know, the safety of American, you know. people in terms of whether it's new technologies, new drugs, new medical devices, and yes, there is a view around. You know, maybe we should take a closer look at some of the things that either are in development or have gotten approved. But I do think, bigger picture, whatever is happening with the FDA. I think it can only be negative for the American public.\n\n00:23:34,950 [SPEAKER_0]\n And I do see the potential of long-term consequences. Again, I won't comment much more.

Um, I do think that you know, you can continue to find very strong, capable companies that are developing, hopefully, transformative medicines for patients. And with that said, I do think that we will continue to see positivity. But again, this yo-yoing of what's happening with FDA policy, I think, is a bit ridiculous.\n\n00:24:14,979 [SPEAKER_0]\n Hopefully, you know, if we have this conversation three months from now or a year from now, like we'll feel still good about what's happening at FDA, but it's just really hard to make sense of what's happening. And a potential topic that I think we've tossed around is this idea about potentially lowering the number of trials required for approval. And I think that can be a net positive for the— And it can be a net positive for the American public. But I do have some issues with that as well. But let me let me stop there and see if we want to tackle that topic.\n\n00:24:45,320 [SPEAKER_3]\n Well, I'll tell you like what pulse. Point about why COVID vaccines have become the um the flashpoint for all this drama. And as I'm thinking about it, it's a few things, right? Vaccines are one of the very few products that will literally touch every human being.\n\n00:25:08,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n In the country, number one, and it's touching them at a time that they're generally healthy, number two, and number three. You know, they're not water. I mean, we saw with the COVID vaccine, there are potential risks such as myocarditis that have to be considered. And then on top of that. Um. We know science is imperfect, right? Anyone who's been in the industry for a blink of an eye knows the limitations of science. We don't have answers to all the questions that people may want, and now, on top of that, in this realm of social media where anyone can have a voice and a pulpit to highlight the deficiencies, the questions around vaccine and to kind of rally some anti-vax sentiment are probably this confluence of forces that are coming together at this point in time and putting vaccines, unfortunately, in a very difficult position now. You know, one thing that's actually evolving coincidentally are passive immunity approaches. Companies like Sidera, companies like InVivid, that are potentially going to offer, instead of vaccine protective immunity, monoclonal antibodies.\n\n00:26:17,370 [SPEAKER_3]\n Protective immunity that may be able to accomplish everything that vaccines can accomplish and more. But not have some of the baggage that's accumulated with the space. In a very interesting time, so I'm sure we could spend a lot more time on this discussion point, but why don't we go on beyond vaccines about how the FDA may be impacting the industry more broadly. Let's come to Unicure. I think we've kind of agreed, it sounds like we've kind of agreed that, you know, it's going to be more on the margins of some products that are not as obvious in terms of offering clinical benefits that outweigh the risk, and hopefully the minority, of products going through the FDA and as such not impacting the broader sector. But let's come back to Cure, Paul. I should say, Paul, and give us kind of the lowdown of what's been happening there.","char_start":23652,"char_end":27273,"start_time":"00:23:34","end_time":null}

So, I mean, they basically updated this week that their meeting minutes are consistent with their meeting they had with the FDA on November 3rd, where it was said that their Phase 1-2 study is not is not well suited to support the basis of a BLA filing for AMT-130, their gene therapy for Huntington's disease. You know, I've been saying this when I know on this on this forum and others, right? Like, whatever you think of their data, whatever you think of this whole idea of comparing to natural history. You know, these guys in May got breakthrough and had a meeting around a statistical analysis plan that was agreed upon for their year three data, which came out in September. And so, for the FDA in November, to kind of suddenly say, 'Okay, you can't file on this,' I guess you're supposed to sort of believe that this May meeting was like a sham, right? Like it's just, and so, you know, I think everyone's trying to kind of make sense of this, right? And I think there's a few questions that are cure specific and a few broader questions, just kind of for investing going forward here.\n\n00:28:11,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean— specific question: is this going to somehow be reversed or will there be a compromise? The compromise could be, maybe, they follow these patients for longer. There's some patients that haven't reached three years, maybe they can have those patients, right? Is there even going to be a path on this study to file? And I think, like, I mean, who knows, right? We don't know, right?\n\n00:28:31,710 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, I think. Separately, I think the question is just like, what does this mean for other rare disease companies, right? Because Josh, you cover some of these stocks too. And I think Brian, you and I both cover Lexia. Like there's a number of these gene therapy companies that are running single-arm pivotal studies.\n\n00:28:47,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n And, you know, these companies have consistent, a number of them have consistently met with the FDA, have breakthroughs, have had dialogues.\n\n00:28:55,100 [SPEAKER_1]\n In this Prasad Sibir, right? And so the question is, should this cure situation lead us to wonder the realness of those regulatory alignments? And I think, at least, what—like I think with the cure situation.\n\n00:29:09,380 [SPEAKER_1]\n You know, it seems like in the spring when they had their meeting, right, Nicole Verdun was at the FDA. And it seems plausible that she or others that were more senior at CBER that are no longer there may have been champions of this and now they're not there. Whereas, you know, if you're meeting with the FDA right now and aligning on a single arm pivotal.\n\n00:29:27,320 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hopefully you're meeting with the folks at CBER who are the decision makers. I also would say, too, with Unicure, right, it's been said before, but, you know, the original goal of this study was not to be. By approvable right, it was originally a placebo-controlled trial, so this was a pivot to a natural history control. And so you know, I think, from my perspective, I mean, every case is nuanced, and I think. The other sort of complicating factor with some of these rare disease companies that are doing single-arm pivots is you can have alignment with the FDA, but that still doesn't tell you exactly what the bar is for approval. How good does your efficacy have to be? But I guess I'm feeling, for rare disease, still cautiously optimistic that if you're pre-specifying everything and you have an agreement that I think we should believe it, right? Like, I do. But, you know, this Unicure situation, I mean, I'm really close to it, right? I've covered this company for a long time. Like, I'm a believer in their therapy. I mean, it threw me for a loop. I felt like their regulatory alignment was pretty strong. I mean, they had a number of meetings, breakthroughs, and everything.\n\n00:30:28,780 [SPEAKER_1]\n But I do think maybe what happened is they were having these meetings with the FDA in the spring, which was kind of a very- transitory time, where we know just weeks or months later, there were significant changes.","char_start":26973,"char_end":31426,"start_time":"00:27:07","end_time":null}

I'm curious what others think.\n\n00:30:49,719 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, I think, you know, one of the things that I think is notable on the Cure side, and I would argue pretty much everyone that I've talked to going through Ciber, no one's like explicitly stated that they have had a meeting where Vinay Prasad spoke or was present at.\n\n00:31:06,410 [SPEAKER_1]\n I've heard the same thing. I haven't talked to anybody who's had that meeting, Brian.\n\n00:31:11,210 [SPEAKER_2]\n So I think that's a little scary because, you know, I know he goes online and he says, 'I'm not micromanaging things,' but I mean. All the signals are that he is inserting himself into decisions all over the place, right? I mean, Tidmarsh made that assertion. You know some of the initial press off of the pastor's resignation. Make that assertion. I mean, he certainly wrote this email that has been spread out over. So he's really taking a very active role, which I'm not surprised at all. I mean, I think that is nature.\n\n00:31:40,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n But that's, I think, a problem, because if you have a viewer who was there under Nicole Verdun and Peter Marks, and you know they're sort of used to this way of management. I don't know that they're like rocking the boat. Some of these things are probably places where, you know, they would have gotten approved, certainly probably would have gotten approved under Peter Marks, CBER. So, you know, I think I think that's interesting. Like if I was, if I had a drug that was going to be up for a CBER-based approval, almost any of any approval of the FDA right now, but certainly through CBER. I would do my hardest. to try to talk to Vinay Prasad and get a very, very clear indication from like, I would want him to write any minutes or sign any minutes that come out.\n\n00:32:28,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Doesn't feel like that's doable though, you know. I mean, again, with Unicure, like, and look, it's one company, right? Like, you know, the FDA has so much to oversee, but, you know, they had, they made this announcement on November 3rd and.\n\n00:32:43,860 [SPEAKER_1]\n They're hoping to have another meeting sometime in the first quarter. I mean, you wish they could have a conversation sooner. Like they have breakthrough. Like, what's breakthrough for? I thought you were supposed to have, like, a bat phone to call the FDA, right? So.\n\n00:32:58,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, it's tricky.\n\n00:33:01,840 [SPEAKER_3]\n What's interesting here is that the facts are the facts. We're just seeing different interpretations of those facts, different applications and decisions around regulation. regulatory prospects, obviously very different than Peter Marks. I think many of us appreciated Peter Marks' very patient, friendly approach to approvals. And he even acknowledged that under his framework, the FDA was going to approve drugs that didn't work. They'd have to figure out how to withdraw them from the market. They wanted to err on the side of caution. And I think for many of us, that might have been a little bit too lenient in terms of the caliber of products approved. I don't think it's controversial to say that, if the Unicure dataset were far more definitive in nature in terms of offering benefit to Huntington's patients, this wouldn't even be a discussion point. It would be approved, and so you know we're looking at a dataset that is prone to perhaps more interpretation than other datasets that we often see.\n\n00:34:06,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n And perhaps not necessarily surprising that this product is getting a little whipped around as we've seen leadership changes at the FDA and perhaps a little bit of a philosophical difference. But again, like this certainly seems to be more isolated an event because of the, let's call it the immaturity of the data in the sense that it's not definitive.

Hey Josh, can I ask you a question?\n\n00:34:33,330 [SPEAKER_1]\n Like, do you cover, like, what? What do you cover, and and Brian too? Because I know you cover Lexia, like, how are you guys thinking about this next crop of gene therapy companies, like in the Rett syndrome space or in some of these genetic cardiomyopathies where they have alignment on running a 15 to 20 patient open-label pivotal trial. Like, do you guys— Like, Brian, do you take all that at face value? Josh, what do you guys think? Because, I mean, look, this FDA put out guidelines in September that read as if. Read with significant Peter Marks vibes, right? So it's like, are we not supposed to believe that? Like, you know, I think it's just interesting.\n\n00:35:14,570 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's.\n\n00:35:15,650 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, card print.\n\n00:35:16,550 [SPEAKER_2]\n I was just going to say, I mean, look, I mean, I look at these names and I think. and I've said this again and again because when I said this again and again and again, I think this is where you get to the heart of like going to just one single study or single arm studies. Right. Like in a case of a parachute, you don't need a 500-patient placebo-controlled study. Right. So so look for something like Lexio, I think you're dealing with endpoints that are obviously not going to be occurring on placebo. Right. And I would say that. Across the board for for all indications, like that's what I want to see. Like I want to see something that's really needle-moving on an endpoint that is you know either reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or is clinical benefit in and of itself. And there's no doubt at it, right? Like I think where we get into these problems is when you have, like, these slowly progressive changing diseases with functional endpoints. Um, that are highly variable over time, and you say, 'Oh, if we do a you know natural history where we're going to select the patients based on like some database and compare our open label experience we're bringing patients into a clinical trial and giving them all the care associated with the clinical\n\n00:36:22,770 [SPEAKER_2]\n trial and then comparing it to sort of like this natural history study you run into a lot of potential issues around you know certainly some level of overstatement right so to me that's where like I worry like if you're trying to make a case where Hey, if I look at like two year progression of this disease and. 100 patients on natural history, I see like. you know, a 10% detriment and you know, in my open label study in 30 patients, like I see. you know flat like I I don't know how to realistically interpret that so you know to me when I'm looking for single arm studies I you know Like if you have a 60% response rate in oncology in a you know relapsed refractory patient like that's not chance really And so that's what I think.\n\n00:37:10,030 [SPEAKER_3]\n And I think that's spot on, and it's consistent with what Vinay Prasad's been saying, particularly about those neurodegenerative diseases that very hard to really prove a treatment effect without a properly constructed randomized clinical trial, but in many other settings. We are seeing signals of the resist equivalent of whatever the disease may be in Rett syndrome. You know, gain of function that that may may appear to be unprecedented for for kids or for cardiac targeting therapies you know a change in left ventricular mass that you know one would really not expect to see outside of an intervention. I've got kind of my own views in terms of of you know that that broad field which is actually probably a good segue to the phase three. Capricorn data.\n\n00:38:06,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n For their uh cardiac, I'm trying to get the product characterization right. But cardio cardio spheres—um— for treatment of muscular dystrophy, a very controversial mechanism, a very controversial application, and path through the FDA that culminated this week in positive phase three data. Now, even that data has been subject to very intense scrutiny on Twitter and amongst investors around the statistical analysis.","char_start":35064,"char_end":39432,"start_time":"00:34:33","end_time":null}

Now, even that data has been subject to very intense scrutiny on Twitter and amongst investors around the statistical analysis.\n\n00:38:38,970 [SPEAKER_3]\n But we do seem to be seeing a fairly consistent signal here across trials, certainly. On cardiac function patients and patient stabilization, there. Uh, as well as some some signs of effects in peripheral muscles, probably one of the most controversial names of the year, kind of winding up now in December. The positive data set stocks up like 400% this week. I want to flag it's a San Diego-based company, so I was excited when we seized. San Diego, San Diego based innovation, thriving, they do have a partnership, uh, for this program with Nippon Shinyaku, but they get a very meaningful, like 30 to 50 um scaled tiered royalty on sales, like, like, super super high royalty. So, again, like a really interesting setup here as we go into, you know, likely an FDA review next year and applying the rigor and scrutiny of Vinay Prasad now on this data set. You know, one where the mechanism doesn't necessarily jump off the page, but there are actually some really interesting possible explanations as to how and why this therapy is working to deliver benefit to patients.\n\n00:39:48,010 [SPEAKER_3]\n I'm not sure if everyone else has been following this name and data set, but it is a great kind of from the conversation about the FDA's approach to Unicure and whether there are gonna be issues for this dataset. Personally, I think it's gonna be very hard to reject this after. A series of kind of consistent signals. Yeah, we don't understand the mechanism fully, but that shouldn't necessarily preclude providing this very important option to patients with a fairly unprecedented data set.\n\n00:40:27,650 [SPEAKER_0]\n I don't have anything else to add on Capricorn. I do think it's interesting that you have drugs that perhaps the mechanism of action hasn't been exactly elucidated and should that be a reason for a treatment not to be made available to the public? I'll just remind everyone we have a ton of neuro drugs. We really don't know how they work and whether these are all more on the psychiatry side. We have lots of drugs that we don't know how they work, but yet they work. And they're approved. So I hope for patients and the Capricor situation that it ends up being a positive.\n\n00:41:02,550 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, Josh, this is it. This is it. This is like the first therapy to hit. cleanly in an RCT in this population, right? How do you not?\n\n00:41:14,120 [SPEAKER_1]\n How do you not approve it, understanding the other things that are approved?\n\n00:41:18,240 [SPEAKER_3]\n Right, yeah, and to get it right, allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells that's what Duramia cell is. Um, specifically, what I so so to continue the kind of this this stream of thought, which I think is really important. Right. When we have a very solid understanding of the biologic pathways and the mechanism by which a therapy is working, and a high degree of a priori confidence, we're even seeing kind of the telltale signs of this from the FDA. The plausible mechanism pathway, right? Like when everything lines up. And a priori, you have a very high probability of clinical success. There's probably less onus on that data set to be definitive, right? Because perhaps a more um a smaller sample size, if it aligns with the underlying biology, we will give it the benefit of the doubt. Um. But when you wind up with a therapy where you just really don't necessarily believe in the mechanism or feel like you understand the mechanism.","char_start":39132,"char_end":42890,"start_time":"00:38:38","end_time":null}

Of data and that's—I think in some ways what the FDA wound up doing. They said, 'Look, we don't necessarily understand how this works with that lens and that framework. We're not necessarily comfortable approving based on the data set that you provided.' However, if you can replicate this and, you know, a well-controlled perspective— clinical trial, then yes, we will we will grant approval. And it seems kind of like that may be playing out. It's great for patients and great for biotech because now we do have perhaps a much more solid foundation of data. To consider this product and really have a lot more confidence in terms of how to manage it. That said, still a lot of controversy— just nitpicking around the statistical analysis plan. I thought the company did a very good job. Um, on their data review, kind of addressing all the questions.\n\n00:43:23,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n Kudos to my colleague, Kristen Kleska, who's had a great call on this one. And at the end of the day, great for patients. All right, we've got a bunch of other data updates to cover, so let's try to cover them as best we can. Why don't we go back to.\n\n00:43:39,130 [SPEAKER_3]\n co-benefit, a dataset we were supposed to get. But turns out we're not going to get it.\n\n00:43:45,390 [SPEAKER_3]\n Greg, do you want to kick us off on this one or Paul? I forget who's gonna...\n\n00:43:49,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no. I'll be happy to. I'll make my comments brief. Yeah, I mean Co-benfi. I think Paul and I know uh the muscarinic mechanism pretty well. Um, you know Co-benfi was the first of these very novel drugs get approved, and it is approved in schizophrenia. It may have had, or be having, some hiccups in terms of its launch in schizophrenia. But I think there is a fair degree of interest and excitement around the potential of expanding the label. We were supposed to be getting phase three data from the ADEPT2 study by the end of this year in a condition called Alzheimer's disease-related adjuvant (ADP), and with some irregularities that were cited by the company, and I guess identified early on, they elected to add more patients to the study. They're going to exclude data from the troubled sites, and they did push out the readout until the end of next year, so I guess we'll all have to stay tuned about what's happening there.\n\n00:44:53,010 [SPEAKER_1]\n I did want to comment on Can I add anything real quick on that? Yeah, well, it's interesting. Yeah, because like I mean, this is an interesting example that just shows you again and again that stocks are all about expectations, right? Because this announcement reads bad. And yeah, Bristol went up and MapLite, a recent IPO with the Muskerinic, went up over 20%, right? And I think the concern here was that this study had essentially completed at the end of July, and we still hadn't gotten the data, right? And, you know, I think investors over time were thinking, well, there's no reason to hold back announcing if the study works. So what's going on? But, you know, what was interesting is that there was a group that, like a DSMB or IDMC, that reviewed the data of ADEPT2 and recommended adding patients to it to fix whatever the powering deficiencies are. Maybe it's from these site conduct issues. And Bristol engaged with the FDA around it.","char_start":42590,"char_end":46350,"start_time":"00:42:21","end_time":null}

And I think we don't know the criteria by which the IDMC was giving Bristol advice on increasing the sample size. But one read of this situation is that a group reviewed some of the data, Bristol may remain blinded, but they reviewed the data and they're seeing some sort of signal, right? And giving them a recommendation of, 'Hey, get the sample size to this point,' right? That might restore. You're powering, right? We've seen this a number of times in psychiatry studies. So, I mean, my interpretation of this event was actually like the probability of success of this trial. Arguably, it goes up versus how we felt a week ago. You know, Greg and I have like— we both covered Cerebel and Karuna. Like, I mean, there's a lot of reason to think that muscarinics should work in this population. The question has always been the therapeutic index, right? And like, Cobenfi. is a great great drug in schizophrenia, um but the dosing in ADP is three times a day. There's this food effect you have to navigate. It's a population that is more sensitive to side effects, especially with psychiatry drugs.\n\n00:46:57,760 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, that's like always been the question. But I actually thought this update, which might have read bad on the surface, was actually a net positive versus how everyone was feeling.\n\n00:47:07,050 [SPEAKER_3]\n Interesting takeaway. Uh, let's go to Praxis. Uh Brian, you're gonna give us the update on this one Brian, you're muted.\n\n00:47:17,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n Thank you. All right, so it's actually two updates and uh, I think it's sort of in the in the regulatory section of the discussion, which uh uh never seems to end on on these Fridays. Um, but the first update that they released was they had a pre-NDA meeting. Um and this is regarding uh the submit potential submission for approval of their drug. Ulexacaltamide. Which had a positive phase three program the other month in essential tremor, anyone who's been following the essential tremor. Space there's virtually there's basically nothing approved in the modern era of uh uh drug approvals for central tremor. It's pretty much been a graveyard of failures. This does this. These three programs do not have sort of a traditional history here. They were actually recommended to futility earlier. This year by a data monitoring committee. They wound up not following that recommendation to stop the study. They continued it on.\n\n00:48:18,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n And when they unblinded the final full data set, on the surface it's an overwhelmingly positive data set they have very strong p values on the primary endpoint across secondary endpoints. There's two studies within the phase three program, so it sort of meets the metric of having two separate clinical studies. It also, I think, very much reflects the data that they saw in their phase two study. So I think it's very, very consistent. But the pushback has really been on this idea that, because of this sort of non-traditional occurrence, the FDA may not be open to reviewing this or through the review, at the end of the review. Uh, the data wouldn't be as uh as positive as we see in the initial top line, so this is sort of a first step toward getting there. I think the worst-case scenario would have been, you know, even through a cursory review of what the data was, the FDA would say something like, 'You know, you know you You didn't follow a DMC recommendation.\n\n00:49:19,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n You changed the timing of the primary endpoint, or, you know, urine analysis is just totally flawed, and we will, you know, do not submit an MDA.'

So I think it sort of meets that first hurdle. And next year, it'll be certainly a hotly debated name. I think this is a company that's trading a little above $4 billion.\n\n00:49:55,560 [SPEAKER_2]\n In market cap, rate I mean, the potential opportunity in ET is certainly um even at peak could be something much more substantial than that, so I think that's sort of the uh debate that we're going to have next year, like, is this going to get approval? Can you see a big move on the upside? Or, you know, are they going to run into regulatory issues? The second data point that I had, I think, certainly less controversial. Had some component of the stock move, but not very surprising. They had a positive readout, this time an interim readout, but due to overwhelming efficacy was stopped for one of their two epilepsy drugs, this one in two subgroups of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.\n\n00:50:35,400 [SPEAKER_2]\n We're going to see that data tomorrow. They just announced that it hit interim. We're going to see the data at AES tomorrow, but I think we already have an earlier cohort of this study. And mechanistically, this is a mechanism of drug that works very well for these types of seizures. So I think you're going to have two NDAs under review from Praxis next year. And that's certainly, you know, I know a lot of us here follow neuro names.\n\n00:51:04,680 [SPEAKER_2]\n It's pretty rare to have two totally different NDAs under review at the FDA for neuroindications.\n\n00:51:11,800 [SPEAKER_1]\n Hey, Brian, there's like, you know, just a double click on the whole Praxis controversy, right? I mean, there's There's some investors out there who are just like worried that this futility to them to study overwhelmingly working thing, that there's like something that doesn't pass the smell test. And then you have, I think, a really substantial imbalance and dropouts between the drug and placebo in that study. Praxis is one of the small handful of neuro names I don't cover. Do you feel like your conversations with them and what they've disclosed publicly have satisfied you around those two issues and any regulatory risks there?\n\n00:51:47,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, I mean, look, I think I think the the nature of the recommendation to stop the study and then have an overwhelming efficacy. I mean, it seems like they've sort of indicated the point estimate at interim and at final analysis. Is the same. You just had, you know, greater variance. And look, I mean, they only had, you know, a little more than 40% of the patient population enrolled at the interim analysis. So look, I mean, I think, I think it was just massively underpowered. I don't know like what the specifics were from the data. monitoring committee that wouldn't see the futility threshold. But I mean, they've sort of indicated that like the data itself doesn't change just the variance and therefore the expectation around like what you would get for statistical significance had. Um, look on the, on the dropout side of things. Yeah. I mean, that's a, that's a big debate. Like, Oh, are you like looking at. You know, an eight-week endpoint and you're basically selecting for responders because your dropout rate is so high. And look, they go through a lot of analysis in terms of tipping point, in terms of using IDT.","char_start":49891,"char_end":53758,"start_time":"00:49:35","end_time":null}

And look, I mean they're all. We're all sort of positive. Uh, most of them wind up still having p values of less than 0. 05. Um, the thing that really sells it to me is they basically had the full effect size at like week. So, you know, before, you know, before they had. Most of the dropouts they were already seeing the same effect side so I think and I think that sort of reflects what the the mechanism is and again, like when you go back and you look at, like, uh, the history of this drug and even this mechanism, like if you actually look at NeuroFriends data, um, you know, they did a very small study, they didn't move forward with it. But I think we look back on that now and you're kind of like, oh, you know, it sort of had a very similar effect. It was just not powered to, you know, be statistically significant. And, you know, I think it's interesting to see if Neurocrime maybe decides to try to even reboot that program.\n\n00:53:51,960 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yes, this has been a colorful and spicy name from the very beginning, so we'll see what comes. Probably not going to have time to get through all our other data updates. The one I do want to talk about— maybe with the remaining time— just because I think it's a good segue to an interesting conversation. That's the Janix prostate cancer data update. Didn't go so well for the company. Stock got cut in half. Trading now close to cash.\n\n00:54:18,360 [SPEAKER_3]\n PSMA by CD3 mass T cell engager that looks like an active drug. In terms of the investor response to the data, there's probably a little mix of a little disappointment in the data relative to where the expectations might have been, but perhaps even. More impactful was the selective disclosure of the company and what they what they chose to present to the street, and what they didn't. They talked to the company afterwards to better understand that what they cited was, you know, the very intense competitive dynamics in the field and not wanting to, you know, have gone through the process of learning some important lessons for their own platform and then informing competitors and giving them that chance to catch up and draft off of the hard work that Janux has done.\n\n00:55:12,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n That explanation has resonated with some investors. It hasn't resonated with other investors, but it is something that I'm hearing. More of, especially with the rise of China's innovation and the view that whatever is done in the U. S. will be matched or quickly even potentially bested by China-based biotech companies. And so perhaps a growing need for secrecy of data and products and constructs and even patents, et cetera.\n\n00:55:43,540 [SPEAKER_3]\n Probably not so much a discussion of the data.\n\n00:55:46,760 [SPEAKER_3]\n You know, that would be a very lengthy discussion, but I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts about this general dynamic and whether we need to be prepared for more selective disclosure due to competitive dynamics and perhaps having to live with being unsatisfied with data sets and having our curiosity\n\n00:56:08,450 [SPEAKER_3]\n not fully addressed. Due to these competitive dynamics, not sure if anyone's kind of come across this situation in a meaningful way before, but I suspect we're gonna be seeing it going forward.\n\n00:56:21,610 [SPEAKER_0]\n Maybe I'll just quickly just say, like, I do think it's all of our discussions, whether it's with corporates or with investors, the so-called rise of China biotech has certainly been an emerging topic.\n\n00:56:35,330 [SPEAKER_0]\n You know, I do think on some level, I've always viewed the U.S.\n\n00:56:39,970 [SPEAKER_0]\n Biotech innovation-based industry is like one of the crown jewels of our country. And so, I think, on some level, it needs to be protected.\n\n00:56:49,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n But then again, competition is competition. So, Josh, I hear you on perhaps how some companies might be approaching this. Disclosure of data and I can understand the argument.

I think it makes it more difficult for what we do to be able to evaluate.\n\n00:57:11,020 [SPEAKER_0]\n How strong a data set is for a company and how to advise clients on to invest or not, if we're going to have more. Selective data disclosures that really don't give us a sense one way or the other, like how good the quality of the data are.\n\n00:57:25,470 [SPEAKER_4]\n I don't know Brian or Paul, you've got to be.\n\n00:57:32,200 [SPEAKER_1]\n There's only some management teams that you know, have earned the right in the eyes of investors to.\n\n00:57:39,660 [SPEAKER_1]\n to do that. To do that, um, this isn't any comment on the Janix team—I don't know that team. Um, so I don't cover that company. I'm sure they're, I'm sure they're a great team, but you know, I think it's it's hard to not give people all the details when investors are keenly focused on those details to compare. In competitive dynamics in a space where there's big companies involved. Um, you know, usually opacity is discounted as something that is negative. You know, I think like, you know, people are cynical, right? And so it's a tough situation to kind of use competitive dynamics as an excuse, right?\n\n00:58:19,070 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, most good spaces are competitive.\n\n00:58:26,640 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, I think I would agree with that, I think.\n\n00:58:29,590 [SPEAKER_0]\n Investors, I think, have a view that, like, if we're going to invest, we are investing in the management team or investing in the asset, the technology, the opportunity. And we kind of expect that we can trust you with our capital and to the degree that management teams choose to be less transparent. I agree with you, Paul, that opacity is not usually well received.\n\n00:59:04,860 [SPEAKER_4]\n Hey Josh, are you on mute?\n\n00:59:06,990 [SPEAKER_3]\n Oh, there you go. Thank you. I was the one screwing up. I'm just going to kind of close out by flagging Otsuka's voice act for IGA nephropathy, priced at nearly $400,000 a year.\n\n00:59:18,780 [SPEAKER_3]\n Kind of ultra premium pricing for these rare and even some of the not so rare diseases continues. Probably a topic that we might be safe from for the next couple of years, but I would imagine these very high launch prices are going to be front and center again at some point. And maybe that's what's going to end the rally of biotech. Hopefully not for a number of years, though. Um. All right, any closing thoughts here? Paul, we'll start with you.\n\n00:59:47,240 [SPEAKER_1]\n On the spot, closing thoughts. No, this was a great discussion. I love it when we have a full analyst takeover. You guys are speaking my language.\n\n00:59:56,340 [SPEAKER_3]\n Greg, how about you?\n\n00:59:59,339 [SPEAKER_0]\n Yeah, no, I mean, I'll just briefly mention we have the ASH meeting that's coming up soon. Lots of companies with really exciting data. I just want to flag one company called Turns Pharmaceuticals. Which has got really interesting data in CML. They've got a big data presentation on Monday. The stock has ripped about 250% since the abstracts were announced. And this could be potentially a best-in-class asset for CML, but obviously it'll be dependent.\n\n01:00:26,740 [SPEAKER_0]\n Data, so I'll be there. Orlando, anyone else is there? Please say hi, but I'm looking for— Soon. Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity to contribute today.\n\n01:00:36,560 [SPEAKER_0]\n Awesome. Brian?\n\n01:00:38,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n No, no, I guess I'll just say it was a great session today. Glad the four of us could be on doing this. I, too, love the analyst.\n\n01:00:47,460 [SPEAKER_2]\n back and forth.\n\n01:00:48,740 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, a lot of fun.

Why don't we start with John Stanford, host of the Making Medicines podcast. Welcome, John. Glad to have you here. And he's here to help us unpack the latest developments regarding the 2026 reauthorization of the National Defense Authorization Act, or ND.\n\n00:01:02,730 [SPEAKER_0]\n Double A. The House passed it this week. Senate is expected to vote on it next week. John, lots of stuff to digest here. Can you walk us through some of the highlights and the implications for the sector?\n\n00:01:16,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Research restrictions with other countries, supply chain implications, STTBR, SBIR, the list goes on. So I'll let you get going on that. And thanks for joining.\n\n00:01:29,280 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, you bet. Well, great to see so many familiar faces. For those of you who don't know Incubate, we're sort of the voice of venture capital and the early stage ecosystem in DC. So we watch things like the defense bill or NDAA— as us DC nerds call it— and all eyes on biotech this year. So the first key takeaway is. This isn't a bill just for warships and planes and Pentagon funding. This is a clear statement that biotech is now moved into. The list of fields, along with quantum hypersonics, AI that frankly are viewed as a national security asset. And so that manifests itself in this bill in a bunch of ways that I'm going to try to get through without putting everyone to sleep.\n\n00:02:17,299 [SPEAKER_4]\n I mean, the first section, I think there's two ways to think about it. There's the good news and then there's the possible constraints that we need to be mindful of. The good news is, is. more investments through the DoD to build it home and to secure the ecosystem. So there will be more money. DOD. Now, we all know that the SBIR-STTR program remains on pause. We can cover that later. But in the meantime, this bill is going to authorize the DOD to effectively build a similar program to subsidize things that are relevant to DOD goals.\n\n00:02:59,750 [SPEAKER_4]\n If you're in the life sciences space and you are navigating synthetic bio, if you are getting involved in biomanufacturing, if you're using AI to develop new molecules, or you're working in the infectious disease space, there's going to be new DOD resources. Most importantly, the DOD is creating a new biotech office. And so long story short, out of this new office is going to come new opportunity for a different type of capital. Um, it's it— you're definitely looking at different terms and conditions when you work with DOD, but it's an emphasis that they are going to fund some research that at a time when NIH cuts, when SBIR programs. You know, DOD may become a new place. So that's one bucket of this 2300-page bill is, frankly, the DOD now cares about biotech. So do the Intel. For the first time, the Intel community thinks CIA, NSA, ODNI, a handful of other ones that are more in Mission Impossible films.\n\n00:04:05,390 [SPEAKER_4]\n They're going to have biotech liaisons and they have enormous pools of money to begin to draw down on. So that's the opportunity bucket.\n\n00:04:16,120 [SPEAKER_4]\n Later in the bill is some things that.\n\n00:04:20,089 [SPEAKER_4]\n might not be viewed so much as opportunity, possibly as constraints. Included in the bill is a watered-down version of the BioSecure Act.","char_start":0,"char_end":4092,"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":null}

Included in the bill is a watered-down version of the BioSecure Act.\n\n00:04:30,100 [SPEAKER_4]\n Those not following it, it's gonna prohibit. There are so many elements of this bill that are focused on China and biosecure in this version. is going to prohibit federal agencies from buying biotech equipment or services from quote biotech companies of concern. This was the big debate that we saw over the last 18 months. The bill has been moderated slightly. This is more about companies cannot access federal dollars, but there are some flow through provisions here. And so, if you begin to take federal money, if you're taking SBIR money when it's turned back on. And you're using companies that are on this list, that's going to be a problem. So there are going to be two lists that everyone on this call has to pay attention to. DOIS is going to manage one; it's actually already existed, called the 1260h list. If a company shows up, if a whooshie ends up on that list, it's going to be difficult to do business with them.\n\n00:05:32,430 [SPEAKER_4]\n There's also going to be a new list that's a little more subjective, out of the White House, through their Office of Management and Budget. That's probably where we will expect to see more of the companies end up that are CDMOs or CROs. If they end up there, they have an opportunity with the White House to explain why they should not be designated a company of concern.\n\n00:05:59,080 [SPEAKER_4]\n Stepping back a little bit, in the defense bill, biosecure is on its path to becoming law and it is going to prevent companies—um, that in any way are touching federal funding— from working with companies of concern. Those companies of concern are probably going to lobby the White House pretty hard on this new list to keep themselves off of it.\n\n00:06:22,130 [SPEAKER_4]\n This is a big one. Biosecure was fiercely debated. It comes amid efforts to onshore and nearshore a lot, and there's a lot more I could go into. I'm going to pause here before I move into something else that I think is super relevant. But in case there are any questions on biosecure, I'm happy to jump on them right now.\n\n00:06:43,730 [SPEAKER_5]\n Hey, John, I have a question. Just thinking about the.\n\n00:06:47,730 [SPEAKER_5]\n The funding that's been taken away from NIH and the funding that's available here now, can you put those two into magnitudes of comparison?\n\n00:06:55,410 [SPEAKER_5]\n And then also NIH, I think to a degree, the funding was there and the scientists decided how to spend it. How are the decisions made here in terms of funding? And interesting, one of them was infectious diseases, where all we hear is trying to get this from a vaccine perspective rather than the effectives. To dilute the effort on vaccines. Could you maybe comment on those?\n\n00:07:18,540 [SPEAKER_4]\n Yeah, I'll take them sort of in reverse order. Priorities of the Defense Department tend to have inputs, one, relative to what's the world. The rest of the world is doing because that's the attitude they're coming at. So if China, and we'll just keep using China as a proxy, but if China is developing something. The DOD doesn't like seeing other countries advancing in the innovative spaces that we're not. And so we're seeing the same thing play out with nuclear and small modular reactors. China is doing it, we're going to start thinking about it in the US. So one way to sort of guess where the DOD is going to put that money is going to be— what is China investing in. And so to some extent, the money is going to be reflexive to what we're seeing. I think there are some.\n\n00:08:12,440 [SPEAKER_4]\n some obvious ones. Some obvious ones—uh, data management is gonna be a a big one. So I think there's a data piece here of how you protect biological data. Um, I think synthetic DNA and RNA is going to be another area of focus. But we'll also hear from DOD what their stated focus is going to be. In terms of scale, we'll see how much funding this actually yields.","char_start":3794,"char_end":8023,"start_time":"00:04:16","end_time":null}

In terms of scale, we'll see how much funding this actually yields.\n\n00:08:38,210 [SPEAKER_4]\n So I'm going to pivot to your other question. On the NIH front, I think it's important to dispel the notion that NIH is facing substantial cuts. As of right now, the cuts to NIH— of the roughly $45 billion spend— are pretty nominal. Now, in some areas, they are existential.\n\n00:09:01,240 [SPEAKER_4]\n And they have cut 500 or a billion, but they're spending it elsewhere. And as the administration would be quick to point out, they have pushed out dollars in this fiscal year faster than the Biden-Harris administration had at this point similarly.\n\n00:09:17,110 [SPEAKER_4]\n We expect NIH to remain well funded to the tune of 40 plus billion dollars.\n\n00:09:23,820 [SPEAKER_4]\n But the priorities, as you laid out, and who gets to say what gets funded—certainly— is in a process of transition.\n\n00:09:33,340 [SPEAKER_0]\n Thank you for that context. I'm conscious of time, and I'm wondering if maybe you can hit a couple more highlights. I know in particular, I had a question about SCTR, SBIR.\n\n00:09:44,770 [SPEAKER_0]\n Reauthorization—I know that it didn't make it in here— and I'm just curious on your thoughts on that and when you know what what do the tea leaves say in terms of if and when we might see that, and then any other major points. To highlight here. I'm sure we'll be talking about this again, you know, over and over over the coming months. There's a lot of policy implications to everything that's going on.\n\n00:10:08,689 [SPEAKER_4]\n Absolutely. And thank you for the opportunity to be on here. The last thing, I'll come to SBIR and SCTR. The last thing everyone should know is there is a new outbound investment regime built into this bill. And I want to be super clear: biotech as of right now is not covered. Um, yet. This is this concept of reverse CFIUS. In the US, we have CFIUS. If a Chinese investor wants to invest in US technology, there is a CFIUS review deciding whether or not that's acceptable.\n\n00:10:39,140 [SPEAKER_4]\n Recently, people have been talking about reverse CFIUS. Should U. S. capital be able to invest in countries of concern? That is now going to be in place through this bill for AI, quantum, and hypersonics. Biotech was not initially included, but this is something we have to pay attention to. Because I know there are some funds on the call. Imagine having to notify the federal government. The White House can add things to this list over time. And you might say, 'Oh, I see this really interesting company I want to invest in outside the United States.' You might have to notify the government of your investment and at times ask for their permission. So more to come on that. But this is a huge deal that we have to pay attention to. On SBIR and STTR.\n\n00:11:24,610 [SPEAKER_4]\n We have a logjam over whether or not foreign funding, foreign-funded companies should be allowed to accept SBIR and this debate over so-called SBIR mills. We do not see a path forward right now for turning the program back on.\n\n00:11:43,530 [SPEAKER_4]\n Any number of people are putting pressure saying. This is, you know, solve your your debate here— really frankly— between only a couple members of Congress and get it turned back on.\n\n00:11:55,800 [SPEAKER_4]\n We had hoped to see, maybe, a three-month extension. Um, but as of right now, people are holding their ground, and we do not expect that to break. The next opportunity for it to break will be the January 30th bill to fund the government— that has to pass— or we'll have another shutdown.\n\n00:12:15,900 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, well, thank you for that context. I know a lot of companies were working on the January 5th deadline and, uh, you know, working over the holidays to hit that deadline for SBIR. Well, things have changed, so let's keep our fingers crossed on that one. Thank you so much for the context and for joining, and obviously stick around. We'll have more commentary on industry sentiment later.","char_start":7723,"char_end":11965,"start_time":"00:08:38","end_time":null}

We'll have more commentary on industry sentiment later.\n\n00:12:37,810 [SPEAKER_0]\n Generally, just a quick industry perspective, and then we're going to jump into conferences. So earlier this week, we saw a day that reached Almost $2 billion in financing. It might have been the biggest single-day total we've seen this year, maybe in longer than a year. And, you know, a couple of examples that have, you know, exciting data that came out this week are turns and wave turns went out for an upside. I think it was six or 650 million ended up raising nearly 750 million. Wave surpassed 400 and a few others. So if you pair that with the recent strength and the XBI, I believe it's up something like 35, 36% year to date. You know, are we finally seeing a real sentiment shift? Despite some of the policy hiccups and challenges. You know, is this signal? Is it noise? What does it mean for 2026? I'd love to do a quick roundtable. Before we jump into the data. And then we're gonna circle back at the end after we've heard anything and talk about some other industry sentiment stuff. So who wants to start?\n\n00:13:39,530 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, Grace, I'll start. These are the best signs we've seen in years, right? Uh, follow-ons are really important. We've seen valuations start to pick up with more biotechs, uh, having more than a billion market cap. The lowering number of negative enterprise value, public companies, all of those point to really good signs going into JP Morgan. The one area that we have not seen—uh, you know— yet is really the IPO window, really opening up. I think, if we see, I'll just pick a number, 10 to 15 IPOs in the first and second quarter of 2026. I think it's going to be a really good year, coupled with valuations, XBI, and just these follow-ons. Where there's definitely money going in. And I think part of that is anticipation that that we're going into a Hopefully a bullish year.\n\n00:14:31,000 [SPEAKER_2]\n I would just have, like most of these, like you said, Grace, are on the back of good data, right? Like I would also add, you know, Chimera on Monday and Dine. You know, I think that that feels like fairly healthy for the space. You know, I think investors sometimes balk at it more just in general. Right. When things are, when a company doesn't really have like a direct.\n\n00:14:54,830 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sort of then and they're just like, 'Oh, it's opportunity, you know, like.' But I think I think you know, we've been talking about that Monday specifically, like on the back of strong data, like you know, a clear use of proceeds, right? Like an opportunity for more people to invest in something that has, like, a lower risk profile, like I think that's hard to argue with, and I agree with Chris, right? Like I think it's a positive indicator, but still, very, very different than opening an IPO window, which we talked about last week. And Josh and I had really, really different estimates for how many IPOs we're going to be next year.\n\n00:15:30,350 [SPEAKER_0]\n Excellent. And anyone else before we jump into the conference?\n\n00:15:33,110 [SPEAKER_5]\n Was it Josh at 100 and you at 50, or Josh was 50, you were 100?\n\n00:15:38,260 [SPEAKER_2]\n I had I had I had 15, which I felt stupid after Josh said, 'Well, I mean, I don't know— how many were this year?' I like there haven't like it's been a great market this fall and there's been what two or three, like, um—I mean, I'm probably low, but Josh said 50, and uh, I felt like that was high, but like, I don't know, you know.\n\n00:15:59,270 [SPEAKER_2]\n I mean, we gave a really wide range.

I mean, all of us can speak like, and I could be interested to hear what your own experiences too. But like, I mean, you can speak on, my narrow sort of, you know, I don't want to talk about specific companies, but my kind of list of companies, right. That I'm like looking at that I'm close with that are kind of in like the later stage. And like the profile of that list is. Like more of a phase two, even sometimes phase three, profile than it's ever been, right? And I compare that to you know, 2020, right when companies were putting in 'ind' acceptance as like a major value-creating event in S1. Right. So, like that's good, right? But I, I don't know if there's 50 of those. There's probably more of those types of companies than ever, but I mean, it might be 20. To be honest, I'm not totally sure. I feel like 50 is a high number for companies that are mid to late stage.\n\n00:17:04,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right. Well, ladies and gents out there, place your bets and let's see what happens next year. Certainly, we're seeing bigger hiccups and bigger implications from good day than we were seeing earlier this year, for sure. So, why don't we jump into, there's ASH, ESMO Asia, there's a number of conferences. Obviously, ASH was huge. Why don't we start with that? Jeroen, why don't we start, you had a couple of competitive readouts that you wanted to highlight, in particular, Lilly versus B1, J &J versus Gilead. Do you want to walk us through a couple of those?\n\n00:17:35,490 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, absolutely. There was a lot, you know, for an Ash that was supposed to be not that busy, we all got slimed. And there was a lot of really great data too which was actually really encouraging. So the first one is Lilly against B1, the battles for the BTK inhibitors. And obviously a huge market, $12 billion in expected BTK sales. The old one, as we all know, is in Rubrica from J &J. That's a really, really sitting a lot of share. And B1 is now the global, officially on a quarterly basis, now the global. global leader, both in the U. S. and ex-U. S., by virtue of their having short superiority against J&J's and Rubica. So Lilly released the anticipated data in first line and second line.\n\n00:18:19,960 [SPEAKER_1]\n It's a non-covalent inhibitor. The other ones are covalent. They certainly were supposed to be better on mutations. The more data that emerged suggested that each one of these classes has their own sort of unique profile. A little bit more Coke and Pepsi. And Jay Pirka just got a ... approved in second line CLL. To make things complicated, this is one that caught ahead a little bit for everybody. What was in the abstract, which looked like shock and awe as potentially going to be the class leader, was definitely a lot more mixed at Ash. The data in patients who are relapsed refractory really did not beat at all. In fact, Lily, I think in the abstract, had the investigator assess data in the presentation.\n\n00:19:04,680 [SPEAKER_1]\n The paper actually had the IRC data, which looked dramatically worse. And then they showed the frontline data, which looked really good, that IRC assessed extremely early. And most of the difference in survival, which was impressive against BR, the historical arm, is because BR had very, very poor tolerability. And out of 10 patients that died, nine died because of toxin. There's only one disease progression. So. Bottom line, putting it all together.","char_start":15444,"char_end":19218,"start_time":"00:16:03","end_time":null}

And most of the difference in survival, which was impressive against BR, the historical arm, is because BR had very, very poor tolerability. And out of 10 patients that died, nine died because of toxin. There's only one disease progression. So. Bottom line, putting it all together.\n\n00:19:33,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n I think there was a lot of sentiment that people will still start with the covalent inhibitors first because they did actually, Brukinza did beat cleanly Imrubica. The relapsed refractory setting. We know you can use Lilly's drugs after like a Brukinza or Calquins, but you don't know if you could use it the other way around. The data from Lilly is very early. In general, it's supposed to be safer, but the safety differences honestly ended up being a little marginal. And then finally, B1 has a monster pipeline in CLL, including a BCL2 inhibitor in combination and a BTK degrader. And frankly, they've moved— their beta-k ( the greater now) to be tested head-to-head against Lily's drug. So this is going to be fireworks for a while. Uh, bottom line is you could argue B1 is no longer the absolute leader with no competition at all. Lilly will be competition. Lilly says that they're going to be doing extremely well. I think other people think they're not going to do quite as well, but B1 really has an amazing pipeline.\n\n00:20:34,230 [SPEAKER_1]\n So this is going to be an exciting area to watch.\n\n00:20:37,570 [SPEAKER_0]\n That's great. And I know we'll hear about Lilly later. They have a big, you know, a lot in the bank to spend. And I know Chris is going to talk about that a little bit later. So they're probably going to be beefing up their pipeline. And do you want to talk about J &J versus Gilead?\n\n00:20:52,220 [SPEAKER_1]\n Yeah, so then there's the JNJ-Gilead or JNJ-Legend against Gilead Arsalex on the CAR-T BCMA battle. And this is a little bit of a tough meeting, I would say, for JNJ. Legend. So remember, J &J and Legend are the leading CAR T for BCMA and myeloma. Their efficacy has been absolutely tremendous. I think it's actually the biggest CAR T for any cancer right now out there.\n\n00:21:17,210 [SPEAKER_1]\n Growing extremely rapidly, and had a huge benefit in second line, but their capacity constraints and that capacity constraints are going to end come early next year. But they do have some noticeable toxicity, and it causes low rates of Parkinsonism, let's say kind of 1% to 3% Parkinsonisms and neurotoxin.\n\n00:21:38,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n percent rate of immune-related enterocolitis, which could be fairly bothersome. And there were some deaths initially.\n\n00:21:48,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n The deaths have really gone down. They know how to manage it now, but it does require hospitalization. The drug from Gileadocel does not cause any of this toxicity.\n\n00:21:58,910 [SPEAKER_1]\n They're going to file early next year for fourth line. The label right now from Corvicti is second line. It looks considerably cleaner, a needle cell. There's debates about efficacy. They released three-year survival data claiming that it looks better, but the data is extremely premature. They didn't give the curves.\n\n00:22:16,510 [SPEAKER_1]\n They have lower CR rates, and J &J has now shown what the comp data could be, and the bar is very high in efficacy. So we think they're probably going to be the same on efficacy. But bottom line, what does this all mean?\n\n00:22:28,590 [SPEAKER_1]\n Clinician feedback is when a needle cell comes to market next year because it's safer and it doesn't have any of these issues. It's really going to be probably the preferred drug, it's really going to have a fourth line label and that's the issue. It's going to be very hard to, if not extremely, extremely hard to use it off-label because there's no data, there's not going to be coverage.\n\n00:22:48,560 [SPEAKER_1]\n So, you know, J &J will grow really well in Europe. They'll grow in earlier line settings. About a third of patients are high risk and they'll take the J &J drug because it shows survival. But Anitocell, over the time, unless J &J could figure out what causes exactly this T-cell expansion and really control it, Anitocell will continue to get more and more market share as they expand the label, but it's going to take time.\n\n00:23:13,550 [SPEAKER_0]\n Okay, great.

Thanks. And Sam, I think you were tracking AZ's CAR-T data. Do you want to talk about that?\n\n00:23:22,610 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, sure. It's quite interesting just picking up from where Jeroen left. I'll come back to J &J later because they might, it's Legend who's most at risk here. Course, because JNG has got a whole bunch of other um, stuff to to talk about, and of course we'll get to what I think was the standout data at the conference, which is the um, majestic, majestic three data, which I'll come back to. But the Astros Carty remember the Astros come into this space— they're not really in myeloma, I mean they're not in myeloma, uh, and they uh, they acquired a a Chinese company called Gray Cell, where two or three years ago data at ASH, I'm pretty it was at ASCO, they all merge into one another after a while in my brain, um, showed some very interesting data, and about six months later, uh, Astrazeneca bought the company. It's not an in-license thing, is they bought it, so this is called AZD0120.\n\n00:24:17,220 [SPEAKER_5]\n And it's slightly different. I mean, everybody is now talking about faster and faster manufacturing. And I'd love to see it in the market. I mean, manufacturing is not the issue. It's actually getting the product from vein to vein. And I think they'll all end up being your own. I'd love to hear your view. Being about the same in the end, about four weeks vein-to-vein or five weeks vein-to-vein. But what is different here is that they've got a CAR-T that targets BCMA and CD19.\n\n00:24:43,700 [SPEAKER_5]\n So this CAR-T, where, of course, you wonder, 'Oh, my gosh, what are you going to do with side effect profile, et cetera, when you get there?' They've got data that they presented in two sets of types of patients, which was groups of patients was quite interesting, particularly the. The second set that came, I think, after the later line setting. The idea here is that BCMA does the job for the plasma cells, and CD19 should go after some of the progenitor cells that are in the bone marrow. That's the idea, or generally. Some of the progenitor cells. And so therefore you should get a deeper, longer duration of response or deeper response, et cetera. And more patients being. I don't want to use the C word, but potentially cured.\n\n00:25:30,620 [SPEAKER_5]\n Um, depending on how long these things go, of course, they first presented the data. These are small trials, right? But then, let's not forget that Johnson & Johnson did the deal with Legend on the basis of a very small trial data set. So in CAR-T, I think you get a good feel. What you don't get is what the duration is. But here we have data that showed really strong efficacy and manageable safety profile.\n\n00:25:52,750 [SPEAKER_5]\n In the newly diagnosed high-risk transplant-eligible patients and the frail transplant-ineligible patients. So it's slightly different subgroup than just the standard new-diagnosed patient group.\n\n00:26:05,980 [SPEAKER_5]\n And the follow-up is 36 and a half months. Of course, it's a China-based trial. And what we ended up with was a 36-month OS of 89%, which is pretty impressive in my view. And there's really not much to compare it with, because not a lot of these Parties have gone that early to the point that, when we had the audience, the chair of the session said, 'You know, is this something that you could see?","char_start":23026,"char_end":26605,"start_time":"00:23:13","end_time":null}

And of course, it's too early to say that, but there are real trials that are ongoing with CARVICT that are trying to literally ask that question: 'Can you displace ASCT? Do you get a better outcome, etc.' Which I think my gut tells me that that's the scientific one, right? My gut tells me that it's going to do better. And I think that this therapy is going to come earlier. um and so azds az is out there with this data and i think they're they're they're in late stage development site toxicity profile wasn't particularly um particularly worrisome given relative uh data that we know and and this smaller small patient sample and of course then they had the later lines where we can start comparing with cartitude one And again, I think that they did show that they have, with decent follow-up, a complete response rate rising.\n\n00:27:34,620 [SPEAKER_5]\n to 78%. I mean, this is 3 . 9 months here, right? Versus 33% of the 1 . 4 months, but it's trending toward the early sets of data that we got from Cartitude one and looking looking very very good. So again, is this another thing for Legend to worry about? Of course, it's a while to come yet. And you end up in a situation where Legend might be, and Corvixi might be much earlier. So the dynamics in Cartier are going to be quite interesting. And just before I go on to Johnson & Johnson's Majestic Three, I just wanted to hear what Jeroen had to say about any of these.\n\n00:28:11,020 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, I totally agree. And then, of course, there was also the BCMA GPC-RD or the GPC-RD from Bristol CAR-T. Of the stars of the show is the Colonia. It's an in vivo BCMA CAR T. Early data, but so it's in vivo. There's no need for leukophoresis, no need for conditioning.\n\n00:28:33,040 [SPEAKER_1]\n Well, literally, you just put a vein in the patient and give him the lentivirus, the fusogen, and it was four out of four MRD negativity. Very quickly. Uh, no. Essentially, icons very little CRS. And there was no infection of anything off it at all on the T-cell side and the macrophage side or on the cancer side. So really, really interesting. Early, obviously, needs to get followed.\n\n00:28:56,460 [SPEAKER_1]\n This is going to be a hot area and there's going to continue to be innovation with that question. And of course, you run that license to Johnson & Johnson. So the at least yeah so the ginger you're right has a broad collaboration but don't have rights to that drug. To that particular one. So what's going on here?\n\n00:29:17,730 [SPEAKER_5]\n Look, I love the data for patients. We went from three to four and we got another 100 uh essentially orr so that was good so it was nice to see that from the abstract to the actual presentation the one thing was the fusion reactions, which I'm assuming they can manage. And you essentially have a gene therapy here. So everyone's going to just worry a little bit until this. This gets through to lots of patients and we see how it all looks like. And durability is the key here, right? We don't know what the durability of these in vivo cartes are like. And this just proves that we're going to keep having to go to ASH and we'll keep following this data, which is really great to see in the. Uh, myeloma space. So Grace, do you want me to move on to J &J?\n\n00:30:02,870 [SPEAKER_0]\n J &J and yeah, kind of the broader area, the bispecifics, trispecifics. And I think you were also going to talk about. Sort of infection risk. In this whole so kind of the broad field. But yeah, start with a great J &J data. It was pretty impressive.","char_start":26305,"char_end":30279,"start_time":"00:26:36","end_time":null}

It was pretty impressive.\n\n00:30:17,840 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, it was. I mean, even before you could take the Cartitude 4. Um car t um uh convicted data and you knew where at 30 months the overall survival was or progression-free survival was and here sorry os data was and you can look at it and this was way above, right, on a This is Darzalex plus Teclistamab or Tecvali in patients with median lines of therapy two. So very similar to the Cartridge-4 data, which is also Johnson & Johnson's. and the control arm was very similar and actually control arm performed really, really similarly. 26% in Cartitude 4, PFS at 30 months. Here we had 30% at 36 months. OS was in line. So a well-controlled study, and I think you would say that you're dealing with a trial that was And it's quite large, right? This is not some phase two or phase one trial.\n\n00:31:19,760 [SPEAKER_5]\n So 290 patients roughly in each arm. So it compared Tecvali plus daratumumab. versus daratumumab triple, so either pomalidomide and dexamethasone or Velcade and dexamethasone. And what did we end up getting? I mean, phenomenal. OS rates of 83% at 36 months versus 65% on the triple. And that OS rate compares to 76% at 30 months. With um uh, in constitute four and then the great, the higher than uh, cr response was fantastic, the mrd response was similar again. So really, you've got something here that could stand up to the cartees if you want to, for want of a better phrase.\n\n00:32:07,240 [SPEAKER_5]\n Side effect profile, well, different, right? So we get CRS for both. We get ICANS to a degree for both. What we don't really get is very serious, lots of grade three issues in terms of neurotoxicity.\n\n00:32:23,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n But what we did get, and you could see that in the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS, is that an early number of patients, not a lot, but a few patients died because of the infection of these causes. So why is that? Because you're essentially chronically um getting rid of your B cells right so which are the ones that are out there who are trying to deal with your disease um and if you get an infection. So that is what they need to address. And of course, this started during COVID. A lot of the patients died of COVID. But of course, that's still possible now.\n\n00:32:56,300 [SPEAKER_5]\n And IVIG wasn't necessarily part of it, so I suspect that when he talked to physicians, which we did—quite a few of them— because the excitement was quite high here. Their view was that with decent IVIG, which is now sub-QT, available as well, you should be able to manage this toxicity. So let's see how this goes. This is up for FDA approval in 2026, if I'm not wrong.\n\n00:33:23,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n And it's going to be very interesting to watch this dynamic. And then Arcelix, which of course is later-line therapy, at some point is going to have to come and compete in this space. All the Cartes are going to compete in the same space. It's going to be very interesting to see how the patients and physicians end up putting their patient groups on different types of therapies here.\n\n00:33:45,270 [SPEAKER_5]\n One last thing I would say is that if you're treated by specific therapy, your probability of responding well to a CAR T afterwards is lower because you end up with pretty much exhausted T cells, unless you end up with a big break between the last. By specific therapy and they need to go to CAR T.\n\n00:34:10,380 [SPEAKER_5]\n Again, you're wrong. Anything to add?\n\n00:34:13,900 [SPEAKER_1]\n No, that was a tour of the force, my friend. That's fantastic.\n\n00:34:18,170 [SPEAKER_5]\n We had data from them on EMD patients. We had some triples, et cetera. But I think we should leave it there because we already have a post.\n\n00:34:27,000 [SPEAKER_0]\n So clearly, we're going to be looking at this field very, very closely because so much data will continue to come out and it'll change the treatment paradigms, right? Like you were saying, in terms of which order you can do stuff, how long you have to wait. But very exciting. And thanks for covering it so thoroughly.

I think, Jeroen, you want to talk about genmabs of Pinkley data. Do you want to jump into that?\n\n00:34:49,830 [SPEAKER_1]\n I can be quick because we have so much to cover.\n\n00:34:54,620 [SPEAKER_1]\n Epkinley is a CD20, CD3 bispecific from GenMab and AbbVie. It's given sub-Q mostly our patient or really charged from any hospitalization initially, which really opened up to the community. Of course, the competition is Roche's Calunvi. It has been doing better for just a variety of reasons in terms of the data and easy use. And remember, the standard of care has always been Rituxan and CHOP in first line. This is a diffuse large B. Really big market approved right now in the third line. They'll have data next year in second and then in first line and that's the point. So the data that came out at Ash is updates up to three years now. When we can really now look historically against our chop and even against, let's say, the stem of the care, technically now is a drug called Polarix with our chip. So it's another antibody. On top of our chop from Roche. And we can now compare next year, uh, Kinley will have data in of a kidney.\n\n00:35:58,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n The bottom line is we really are at a point that we think they're going to be the best regimen out there. And that's based on the data that we saw and our consultants, and that's going to be important. For the companies and really provide amazing innovation for patients, especially if they could move the whole thing to be outpatient and with no need for initial hospitalization. A year later, Roche will come up with their new data, which is now going to test everything together. They're basically, by specific, on top of Polarix. chip so at that point we're talking about like a cocktail of like you know you know five six drugs together and that we'll have to see whether that could look better than the new Kinley regimen. But the innovation now is absolutely amazing and increasingly less and less chemo. I mean, chemo is really going away, thank God.\n\n00:36:48,779 [SPEAKER_1]\n I mean, standing ovation at ASH. I mean, the data was really good. It's really great, including elderly patients. So it's really, it's hard not to get excited, a little emotional as to how good things are going.\n\n00:37:00,260 [SPEAKER_0]\n That is exciting, and it's great to hear your passion about it, because you're right. I mean, this is going to be huge for patients on a number of levels. And now back to Sam. I know one of the other big stars at ASH was Terence Farmer. Where they had impressive data in CML with their new novel allosteric inhibitor. Do you want to tell us a little bit more about that?\n\n00:37:20,570 [SPEAKER_5]\n And I know there's an interview with Amy Burroughs that uh Brad did on biotech TV that was great if people haven't seen that yeah as always he did a fantastic job in such a short time that he does these things. So look, the drug's called Tern701. As you said, it's an allosteric modulator, so the trial is called Cardinal 85. Patients and I think the fundraising tells you the story. They went out looking for 400, and they closed that at 650. Right. That's the way it goes. And of course, it's for CML. I'm going to summarize it. We've got a once-a-day drug. Which is um better than where the standard of care which is um uh siminib from Novartis you could have it with or without food again better tox looks better no dlts no pancreatic toxicity efficacy looks better um that's obviously not in a head-to-head it's in a as we always do all of these things we've been talking about is uh is cross trial comparisons of course um so and the and the efficacy measure here is mmr and so in this particular one what was nice to see is that 43% MMR response in patients which had prior siminib either dropped off because of lack of efficacy or tolerability and then 50\n\n00:38:38,020 [SPEAKER_5]\n in priority ki exposed so really not much else needed to be added here i mean the market's already there we know what the market's worth given what we see from uh Novartis they created the market and so let's see where Terence goes.

No. Perfect.\n\n00:39:24,420 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, we'll continue the tour, the conference tour of the force with this dynamic duo. So Sam and Jeroen, I know we want to hit some highlights from ESMO Asia and a couple of other conferences. Who would like to start?\n\n00:39:36,400 [SPEAKER_5]\n Your own.\n\n00:39:37,670 [SPEAKER_0]\n Unless he doesn't want to stop.\n\n00:39:38,810 [SPEAKER_1]\n Happy to. I can be very quick. So there is, we all know one of the original immuno-oncology drugs was Yervoy, CTLA-4. A drug from Bristol, which was supposed to be one of the most hot areas out there. With Optiva, of course, what we've learned, CTLA-4 does have efficacy, but it's got a lot of tox. Well, um, BioNTech has a gentler version. Now in phase three. And they showed the the first part phase three study in second-line lung cancer, head-to-head against chemo, docetaxel. You know, docetaxel is one of those old drugs that always seems to do pretty well when you go head against it. Everybody thinks, like, the smallest, you know, the shortest drug out there and everybody's going to beat it. And then they all get. Knocked one after the next, and they can't beat it well in this part. A uh, the data looked very good. It's actually in uh, you know, lung cancer is squamous or non-squamous. The histology—non-squamous— is far bigger, squamous is smaller.\n\n00:40:42,430 [SPEAKER_1]\n Squamous typically has poor outcomes and harder to treat. Well, in phase three, was testing both. They actually got into clinical hold, partial hold with FDA because we think there's probably some tox in the non-squamous, which is the bigger part of the area of the market. With FDA, they agreed not to advance that forward further and just went with the smaller squamous. And this is early data. This is part A, but it looked really good.\n\n00:41:09,480 [SPEAKER_1]\n Definitively better on efficacy so far.\n\n00:41:12,799 [SPEAKER_1]\n Then, docetaxel, so under that, they're now going to completely enroll the rest of the study. It's a CTLA4 antibody, so it is a little bit more ph-mediated. It does to be, seems to be, better tolerated than the Bristol one, and, of course, you expect there is going to be a price to pay on more talk. So we are seeing more talks, but uh, good efficacy so that's encouraged.\n\n00:41:37,310 [SPEAKER_1]\n And that's moving into the next part. BioNTech's got a fairly robust pipeline now, in general, moving into late stages. And so this is going to be a part of the future. And we'll continue to do this. But it's nice to see something finally working in that segment.\n\n00:41:56,310 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great, thanks. Sam?\n\n00:41:57,850 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, I'll pick it up from there. So we did have some data from a couple of new rich targets. So this one, B7H3, is one that's caused trouble for some people. In other settings, and these are the ADCs that companies like Biontech have— one.\n\n00:42:15,470 [SPEAKER_5]\n And of course, GSK had some data that showed that Esmo Asia, remembering that, of course, a lot of Esmo Asia data is China-focused patients, because that's the whole point of it, but some of them are not. So GSK here showed some data with their B7-H3ADC, RIS-RES, I won't have a better name, RIS-POTATOG, RIS-TECAN, it doesn't matter. RIS-RES is quite good. Encouraging activity in the Chinese non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients, right? So we're still in a non-squamous setting. Uh, responses in the squamous and oncogenic cohorts were a bit muted, but it does. You know, we still have an opportunity in non-squamous. Of course, the end the game will have to be: how do you ask these patients and what do you choose to give them, etc.","char_start":38146,"char_end":42554,"start_time":"00:38:38","end_time":null}

Of course, the end the game will have to be: how do you ask these patients and what do you choose to give them, etc.\n\n00:42:59,560 [SPEAKER_5]\n And the data seems, in terms of 33% objective response rate, similar to what we've seen with Amgen's YL201.\n\n00:43:10,360 [SPEAKER_5]\n BNT three to four, perhaps not as good, but then it's very hard to compare these numbers here and mark. American Daichi have got another similar product that's in development.\n\n00:43:22,460 [SPEAKER_5]\n So it's complicated and there's a lot of comparisons to be made, early data sets, small patient numbers. They're all trying to go out there. The only other one I want to highlight is a tri-specific DLL3 in small cell lung cancer, which came is called Alveltamig. It's from Zellgen.\n\n00:43:43,740 [SPEAKER_5]\n And I have to say, I think, if again, very broad brush here, cross-trial comparison, the response rate in this China only small cell patient cohort look very decent. Now let's remember that patients in China tend to get lung cancer not necessarily driven by smoking but the etiology is due to pollution mostly so we have to accept that the biology is different. So it's hard to do cross-trial. It's even harder to do cross-trial comparisons here unless you have a China-only cohort. But the data in this patient. population sets the bar at least from a China perspective. And what it does is that it's one of those antibodies that's got two binding sites on DLL3, which often seems to change the way things work as we've seen with design works um zahira and uh so this is the DLL3 CD3 triple-specific.\n\n00:44:46,462 [SPEAKER_5]\n If you want to call it that, so that looks that looks quite exciting and and um. Another one added to the large list of DLL3 targeting agents, both atcs and by specifics. I'll leave it there.\n\n00:45:00,910 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great, thanks. And either of you want to quickly address the CG oncology data at SUO?\n\n00:45:10,240 [SPEAKER_5]\n I can very quickly. You're absolutely right. Good data. It's an interesting setup coming up in the next few couple of years with regards to non-muscle invasive bladder cancer where Johnson & Johnson's in Lexo. is already approved. That's the um gemcitabine eluting pretzel, which is an intra-vesical device.\n\n00:45:34,720 [SPEAKER_5]\n And so we're looking at the data that CG presented on the surface again, cross-trial comparisons of the BOM-003 trial, which is a phase three trial, versus the Sunrise-1 trial, which is the comparison we made. Both presented at the- urological oncology conference. Similar efficacy from what we can see. At the six-month rate, the event-free survival.\n\n00:46:00,340 [SPEAKER_5]\n And the side effect profile of CG's drug looks a little bit better, again, in this cross-trial comparison. And of course, they're completely different modalities. So what's going to be interesting is how physicians will decide between these two.\n\n00:46:20,670 [SPEAKER_5]\n Options and um and of course, one's marketed by Jones and Johnson, the other one's marketed by CG. So let's see how this all pans out. But good data.\n\n00:46:31,880 [SPEAKER_0]\n Great, thank you. So that wraps up some of the conference stuff. I know we have a couple more data things to go through. One is Paul, and I think Chris was also going to comment on the dying positive DMD data. Paul, do you want to start with that?\n\n00:46:47,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, sure. Thanks. And it is a good segue into the conversation we always have to have each week, it feels like, on just what is going on with the FDA.","char_start":42254,"char_end":45981,"start_time":"00:42:59","end_time":null}

And it is a good segue into the conversation we always have to have each week, it feels like, on just what is going on with the FDA.\n\n00:46:57,510 [SPEAKER_2]\n But yeah, Dyn reported positive data from their registrational study of their DMD exon skipper for exon 51. For context, these guys have a month. Delivery platform using the transferrin receptor, this has been a hot space with delivery to muscle and brain, and there's a number of companies in this area. Essentially, what they were was that they made close to 3% of normal dystrophin at six months, which, you know, apples and oranges a little bit across trials, but it's about 10x what you see. With the standard of care at that time point, Exondas. And they also saw pretty compelling separation on another functional endpoints, a number of functional endpoints versus a placebo. SIBO arm. A lot of the questions I was getting from investors were really just around the statistics and these comparisons in small sample sizes, which is fair. I think people are asking the right questions, but you know, in the backdrop of some disappointing confirmatory data for other exon skippers that make less dystrophin, these data were really promising and I would say better than expectations.\n\n00:47:58,410 [SPEAKER_2]\n You know, the question here, right? is like, if we were in the FDA environment that we have been in in the past 10 years, I think it would be perceived as an absolute no-brainer that this would be highly likely to get approved. And I do still think that most investors think this is likely to get approved. I agree with that. I mean, I think these data clearly seem to be above the bar for what they're going for, which is accelerated approval.\n\n00:48:21,590 [SPEAKER_2]\n But, you know, the stock traded up, you know, it was a little bit sideways. They also financed, but. I think part of that is really just the whole broader discussion around the FDA and the kind of investors, I think, being a little bit confused around philosophically, what exactly does this FDA stand for from a regulatory perspective in rare disease, right? You've got comments from Macri that are like so bullish. You've got certain actions that are confused. You have comments from Dr. Prasad. We don't have to rehash the whole thing, but, you know, Dinah's kind of become intertwined with the regulatory debate that I think we've talked about pretty much every week I've been on the show this fall. Chris, what do you think?\n\n00:49:00,090 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, no, good assessment, Paul. Yeah, look, I think at the end of the day in DMD, all roads kind of lead back to Sarepta. And Sarepta, you know, set a low bar for a special. Exxon 51 and I think a lot in the industry thought, okay, if we can just clear the dystrophin biomarker, and you know, which you know, clearly did, and obviously avidity did this with Exxon 44, uh, in compelling ways, but you know, it's still uh, I still struggle with the fact that we have not seen a strong clinical data set that is correlated to the biomarker, and you know, you bring up the issue with the FDA. I think, you know, if they we were looking at just the precedent of Sirepta, I think absolutely, I think. What are their true feelings about the Exxon Skipper data of Sarepta? Would they revisit the strength of data that they want to see for approval? But if that's the standard, I think they've clearly cleared that. But you know, it's frustrating just for someone who's, you know, done this and followed DMD, that we just don't have the real robustness of the statistics.\n\n00:50:03,270 [SPEAKER_3]\n Part of that is sample size, but part of it's effect size, as well, of just how much of an impact. You can make, you know, in six months or, you know, even two years.","char_start":45681,"char_end":49609,"start_time":"00:46:47","end_time":null}

You can make, you know, in six months or, you know, even two years.\n\n00:50:10,730 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, six months is such a high bar. Hey, Chris, can I ask you a question? Because, like, you know, I think investors on the downside, right, are trying to figure out, like, okay, like, you know, know, how is Dine sort of exposed to what the outcome is with Sarepta, right? With a couple of these confirmatory studies failing. And I know Sarepta, you know, has maybe a different depiction of the data and is going to talk to the FDA. I guess like. From my perspective, right, like Exondus hasn't failed in a confirmatory study. So, if it hasn't, I don't see how that drug could get pulled from the market based on a different exon skipper failing and if it's not pulled from the market, like what would you see as the path for the FDA to reject something that is clearly making more protein and looks like it's safe.\n\n00:50:53,170 [SPEAKER_3]\n I think you're exactly right. I mean, look, if you go back to the original Sarepta controversy, and I live this— front row seat— is that they rejected our path to an NDA because per census trials failed and PTC trials failed and they tried to extrapolate that. And we said, no, we called foul on that. And we said, you should look at our data, even though it's a smaller data set. So I think the meta question is, are we going to see different criteria coming out of this new FDA that would throw everybody off? But I think, you know, based on precedent and based on how you've described it. I think, yeah, the conventional wisdom is they're going to get approved. I think it's really hard to tease out where the market sits on this. And you're closer to it because you know three billion-dollar market cap, a lot of that's driven by, you know, the DM1 program. And so it's really hard to tease out what this DMD program is really driving in terms of, you know, the stock price.\n\n00:51:50,610 [SPEAKER_2]\n Yeah, I mean, I just— I think it's— I think it's a polarizing topic. Like, you know, I think there's people who totally agree with our conversation. I think there's investors who throw their hands up and say this FDA is unbettable.\n\n00:52:02,360 [SPEAKER_0]\n Well, on that note, I know that we'll continue to monitor that topic in the coming months and years. And the other topic that we always hit on, we only have a couple more minutes. Today, which is obesity, there's a deal: Pfizer-Fosun deal for a phase one asset worth up to billion in deal value with $150 million up front. And then there was some data from Structure, Wave, and other data. I know, Paul, you wanted to cover Wave. I don't know if, Sam, you want to start with the deal, then we'll jump into data. Uh, real quick, what are the top highlights?\n\n00:52:33,610 [SPEAKER_5]\n Yeah, the top highlight is that it's an asset that comes out of one of Fosun Pharma's um subsidiaries. Just for, if anybody's in, I did a podcast with the global head of R&D for First One Pharma on our vanguards of healthcare podcast. So you can go and listen to how they're structured. This is Yao Pharma. And it's a small molecule. It's a true small molecule, GLP-1. And it's in phase one. I've tried to squeeze some data out, but I can't. There's no data yet. Yet, but I think we might get some by the middle of the year. $150 million upfront, and up to $1. 94 billion milestones, and, of course, tiered royalties. So what would be interesting is to see if this ever gets covered by what we were just talking about right at the start in terms of the US companies.\n\n00:53:21,589 [SPEAKER_5]\n Buying financing, putting money— i don't know how this would pan out— with that, with that bio not biosecure, I can't remember what the name of it was, but anyway, so that's a good um, that was a good deal, that came out, and then we had some data. Pretty much every day, I think, right? um, Did you want me to cover the data as well?\n\n00:53:42,140 [SPEAKER_0]\n Sure, why don't you hit the highlights? I know we only have about five more minutes. Um, and then I know Paul wanted to cover Wave. Go on, Paul, go ahead first.","char_start":49309,"char_end":53646,"start_time":"00:50:03","end_time":null}

I know we only have about five more minutes. Um, and then I know Paul wanted to cover Wave. Go on, Paul, go ahead first.\n\n00:53:54,190 [SPEAKER_2]\n Sure. I mean, it's a fun topic, right? And I can be really quick and throw it out to the group, because Adam Feuerstein, a. I guess a friend of the podcast, right? Had a pretty uh interesting, provoking, and funny uh headline on the data, but yeah, wave reported uh single dose data to their inhb program. This has been an a target of interest in the obesity space. They reported a 9% reduction in visceral fat, almost a 5% reduction in total body fat, and an increase in lean mass and, you know, at a high level. Right. I mean, I think this is directly addressing. I think one of the issues people have with the glyph drugs is that, you know, they have this benefit on outcomes, this benefit on body fat. Right. But also, maybe a negative. negative effect on muscle and just kind of exercise capacity and things like that. So conceptually, this looks super, super interesting. I mean, it's very early. It's early data. The stock went up. A couple hundred percent. But, you know, I think what Adam pointed out in his article was that total body weight did not.\n\n00:54:55,990 [SPEAKER_2]\n Down, I think it actually went up a little bit, right? And, like, you know, these are small sample sizes. Right? Like, also, there's certain i think wonkiness with placebo as well. And, so, I mean, it was, I think, it's kind of a thought provoking point that, just like, these data are really interesting, but what is the actual regulatory path here? And, you know, is this early data set ultimately replicable?\n\n00:55:17,620 [SPEAKER_2]\n I don't cover Wave. The tone of his article is probably a little bit more negative than how I feel about this initial data, but it's an interesting debate nonetheless. Because, I mean, I think on the one hand, you could say this is, you know, directly addressing a deficiency in the standard of care. I think on the other hand, you could kind of say, OK, it's a small data set. And, you know, maybe there has to be, like, a different type of regulatory path here, teased out.\n\n00:55:38,580 [SPEAKER_5]\n See, Paul. I've looked at Adam, and you know, I'm a big fan of his. I think our headline was better: WVE 007, early obesity data. Has license to thrill. See?\n\n00:55:53,280 [SPEAKER_2]\n I like that. I like that. That's pretty good. I mean, he called it a Jim Bro drug, which I thought was like kind of funny, you know, but yeah, no, I mean, look, it's like, I mean, what do you think, Sam? Like, I think. I mean, I read everything that Adam writes and I read a lot of your guys' stuff too. Like, do you, are you bullish on it?\n\n00:56:08,080 [SPEAKER_5]\n Early data, a kind of, no weight loss was observed, which of course you could argue with the fat versus muscle, et cetera. But early data, and I think it's, the safety profile seemed clean. Uh, let's see, let's see how this pans out and how it fits with the with the in the current massive uh obesity pipeline right, which of course was then we had athletes from China with some weight loss data with their GLP-1, and then a retired triple G that came out, which people got a bit confused about because of the dropout rates and all that, but a whole bunch of the dropouts was because people were losing too much weight. And we knew that already. So I think the Lilly data for Triple G came out actually better than I thought it would. And, you know, Lilly has always positioned it for patients that are very obese. So it's quite, it would be interesting to see how this pans out all.\n\n00:57:00,810 [SPEAKER_5]\n Certainly no.\n\n00:57:02,700 [SPEAKER_5]\n No day goes by that obesity doesn't have some news or something.\n\n00:57:08,130 [SPEAKER_0]\n All right, guys. Well, we have. Thank you guys so much. There's a lot to unpack there. And I know we only have another minute. I need to wrap up. Let's go around the room. I would like to ask you guys to each from zero to 10, how optimistic are you are for biotech next year? And don't condition it. Just give me a number. Chris, you want to start?\n\n00:57:28,640 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I'd say for next year, I'd give it a.\n\n00:57:32,470 [SPEAKER_3]\n Seven and a half. Ooh, okay.

We didn't have time to go into along these lines, the Endpoints 100 survey and their new Biopharma Sentiment Index. I know, Chris, you wanted to cover that. Can we catch the panel replay somewhere?\n\n00:58:17,200 [SPEAKER_3]\n Yeah, I think that the archive is available, but the basic quick summary is that the investors are the most bullish, then followed by biotech professionals, then followed by. And lastly, academics, obviously, because of the NIH cuts. But overall, it's moving in the right direction, consistent to what the whole panel has said. It's looking more bright for 2026. Let's hope that's true.\n\n00:58:39,510 [SPEAKER_0]\n Awesome. And it turns out that the BPS SI, I think, out of 100 was 7. 8, which align or 78, which aligns very well with what you guys predicted. We're going to have to wrap it up now. Thank you to all of our hosts, co-host, special guests, and everyone who's listening.
